the mother seems crushed and terrified as if by an intolerable weight of shame and abasement. she is dressed in modest black and wears a thick widow's veil of crêpe. when she lifts this, she reveals a wax-like face. she always keeps her eyes downcast.

the step-daughter, is dashing, almost impudent, beautiful. she wears mourning too, but with great elegance. she shows contempt for the timid half-frightened manner of the wretched boy (14 years old, and also dressed in black); on the other hand, she displays a lively tenderness for her little sister, the child (about four), who is dressed in white, with a black silk sash at the waist.

the step-daughter [advances towards manager, smiling and coquettish]. believe me, we are really six most interesting characters, sir; side-tracked however.

the father. yes, that is the word! [to manager all at once.] in the sense, that is, that the author who created us alive no longer wished, or was no longer able, materially to put us into a work of art. and this was a real crime, sir; because he who has had the luck to be born a character can laugh even at death. he cannot die. the man, the writer, the instr

the step-daughter. fortunately for her, he is dead. two months ago as i said. we are in mourning, as you see.

the father. he isn't here you see, not because he is dead. he isn't here -- look at her a moment and you will understand -- because her drama isn't a drama of the love of two men for whom she was incapable of feeling anything except possibly a little gratitude -- gratitude not for me but for the other. she isn't a woman, she is a mother, and her drama -- powerful sir, i assure you -- lies, as a matter o

the father. phrases! isn't everyone consoled when faced with a trouble or fact he doesn't understand, by a word, some simple word, which tells us nothing and yet calms us?

the step-daughter. so he thought of it -- for them!

the father. that's not true. i meant to do good to them -- and to myself, i confess, at the same time. things had come to the point that i could not say a word to either of them without their making a mute appeal, one to the other, with their eyes. i could see them silently asking each other how i was to be kept in countenance, how i was to be kept quiet. and this, believe me, was just about enough of itself to keep me in a constant rage, to exasperate me beyo

the father [suddenly turning to the mother]. it's true about the son anyway, isn't it?

the mother. he took my son away from me first of all.

the father. but not from cruelty. i did it so that he should grow up healthy and strong by living in the country.

the step-daughter [pointing to him ironically]. as one can see.

the father [quickly]. is it my fault if he has grown up like this? i sent him to a wet nurse in the country, a peasant, as she did not seem to me strong enough, though she is of humble origin. that was, anyway, the reason i married her. unpleasant all this may be, but how can it be helped? my mistake possibly, but there we are! all my life i have had these confounded aspirations towards a certain moral sanity.

[points to the step-daughter.]

the step-daughter. oh yes, that's true enough. when i was a kiddie, so so high, you know, with plaits over my shoulders and knickers longer than my skirts, i used to see him waiting outside the school for me to come out. he came to see how i was growing up.

the step-daughter. yes, yes. true. he used to follow me in the street and smiled at me, waved his hand, like this. i would look at him with interest, wondering who he might be. i told my mother, who guessed at once. [the mother agrees with a nod.] then she didn't want to send me to school for some days; and when i finally went back, there he was again -- looking so ridiculous -- with a paper parcel in his hands. he came close to me, caressed me, and drew out a fine straw hat from the parcel, with a bouquet of fl

the step-daughter. all appear to have the courage to do them though.

the father. yes, but in secret. therefore, you want more courage to say these things. let a man but speak these things out, and folks at once label him a cynic. but it isn't true. he is like all the others, better indeed, because he isn't afraid to reveal with the light of the intelligence the red shame of human bestiality on which most men close their eyes so as not to see it. woman -- for example, look at her case! she turns tantalizing invi

the step-daughter. a real high-class modiste, you must know, gentlemen. in appearance, she works for the leaders of the best society; but she arranges matters so that these elegant ladies serve her purpose . . . without prejudice to other ladies who are . . . well . . . only so so.

he does sense me -- and not as i inside of myself feel myself to be. it seems to me then that account should be taken of this by everyone whose duty it may become to criticize us . . .

the manager. heavens! the man's starting to think about the critics now! let them say what they like. it's up to us to put on the play if we can. [looking around.] come on! come on! is the stage set? [to the actors and characters.] stand back -- stand back! let me see, and don't let's lose any more time! [to the step-daughter.] is it all right as it is now?

the step-daughter. well, to tell the truth, i don't recognize the scene.

the manager. my dear lady, you can't possibly suppose that we can construct that shop of madame pace piece by piece here? [to the father.] you said a white room with flowered wall paper, didn't you?

the father. yes.

the manager. well then. we've got the furniture right more or less. bring that little table a bit further forward. [the stage hands obey the order. to property man.] you go a

manager and father. yes, yes, an ordinary envelope.

property man. at once, sir. [exit.]

the manager. ready, everyone! first scene -- the young lady. [the leading lady comes forward.] no, no, you must wait. i meant her [indicating the step-daughter.] you just watch --

the step-daughter [adding at once]. how i shall play it, how i shall live it! . . .

leading lady.[offended]. i shall live it also, you may be sure, as soon as i begin!

the manager [with his hands to his head]. ladies and gentlemen, if you please! no more useless discussions! scene i: the young lady with madame pace: oh! [looks around as if lost.] and this madame pace, where is she?

the father. she isn't with us, sir.

the manager. then what the devil's to be done?

the father. but she is alive too.

o knows if, by arranging the stage for her, she does not come here herself, attracted by the very articles of her trade? [inviting the actors to look towards the exit at back of stage.] look! look!

[the door at the back of stage opens and madame pace enters and takes a few steps forward. she is a fat, oldish woman with puffy oxygenated hair. she is rouged and powdered, dressed with a comical elegance in black silk. round her waist is a long silver chain from which hangs a pair of scissors. the step-daughter runs over to her at once amid the stupor of the actors.]

the step-daughter [turning towards her]. there she is! there she is!

the father [radiant]. it's she! i said so, didn't i? there she is!

the manager [conquering his surprise, and then becoming indignant]. what sort of a trick is this?

leading man [almost at the same time]. what's going to happen next?

juvenile lead. where does she come from?

l'ingénue. they've been holding her in reserve, i guess.

leading lady. a vulgar trick!

the magic of the stage itself, which has indeed more right to live here than you, since it is much truer than you -- if you don't mind my saying so? which is the actress among you who is to play madame pace? well, here is madame pace herself. and you will allow, i fancy, that the actress who acts her will be less true than this woman here, who is herself in person. you see my daughter recognized her and went over to her at once. now you're going to witness the scene!

[but the scene between the step-daughter and madame pace has already begun despite the protest of the actors and the reply of the father. it has begun quietly, naturally, in a manner impossible for the stage. so when the actors, called to attention by the father, turn round and see madame pace, who has placed one hand under the step-daughter's chin to raise her head, they observe her at first with great attention, but hearing her speak in an unintelligible manner their interest begins to wane.]

the manager. well? well?

leading man.

what does she say?

leading lady. one can't hear a word.

juvenile lead. louder! louder please!

the step-daughter [leaving madame pace, who smiles a sphinx-like smile, and advancing towards the actors]. louder? louder? what are you talking about? these aren't matters which can be shouted at the top of one's voice. if i have spoken them out loud, it was to shame him and have my revenge. [indicates father.] but for madame it's quite a different matter.

the manager. indeed? indeed? but here, you know, people have got to make themselves heard, my dear. even we who are on the stage can't hear you. what will it

[the step-daughter coquettishly and with a touch of malice makes a sign of disagreement two or three times with her finger.]

the manager. what do you mean by no?

the step-daughter [sotto voce, mysteriously]. there's someone who will hear us if she [indicating madame pace.] speaks out loud.

the manager [in consternation]. what? have you got someone else to spring on us now? [the actors burst out laughing.]

the father. no, no sir. she is alluding to me. i've got to be here -- there behind that door, in waiting; and madame pace knows it. in fact, if you will allow me, i'll go there at once, so i can be quite ready. [moves away.]

the manager [stopping him]. no! wait! wait

the step-daughter [interrupting him]. no, get on with it at once! i'm just dying, i tell you, to act this scene. if he's ready, i'm more than ready.

the manager [shouting]. but, my dear young lady, first of all, we must have the scene between you and this lady . . . [indicates madame pace.] do you understand? . . .

the step-daughter. good heavens! she's been telling me what you know already: that mamma's work is badly done again, that the material's ruined; and that if i want her to continue to help us in our misery i must be patient . . .

madame pace [coming forward with an air of great importance]. yes indeed, sir, i no wanta take advantage of her, i no wanta be hard . . .

[note. madame pace is supposed to talk in a jargon half italian, half english.]

the manager [alarmed]. what? what? she talks like that? [the actors

 burst out laughing again.]

the step-daughter [also laughing]. yes yes, that's the way she talks, half english, half italian! most comical it is!

madame pace. itta seem not verra polite gentlemen laugha atta me eef i trya best speaka english.

the manager. diamine! of course! of course! let her talk like that! just what we want. talk just like that, madame, if you please! the effect will be certain. exactly what was wanted to put a little comic relief into the crudity of the situation. of course she talks like that! magnificent!

de to one in language of that kind, the effect is certain, since it seems almost a joke. one feels inclined to laugh when one hears her talk about an "old signore" "who wanta talka nicely with you." nice old signore, eh, madame?

madame pace. not so old my dear, not so old! and even if you no lika him, he won't make any scandal!

the mother [jumping up amid the amazement and consternation of the actors who had not been noticing her. they move to restrain her]. you old devil! you murderess!

the step-daughter [running over to calm her mother]. calm yourself, mother, calm yourself! please don't ...

the father [going to her also at the same time]. calm yourself! don't get excited! sit down now!

the mother. well then, take that woman away out of my sight!

the step-daughter [to manager]. it is impossible for my mother to remain here.

the father [to manager]. they can't be here together. and for this reason, you see: that woman there was not with us when we came . . . if they are on together, the who

the manager. it doesn't matter. this is only a first rough sketch -- just to get an idea of the various points of the scene, even confusedly . . . [turning to the mother and leading her to her chair.] come along, my dear lady, sit down now, and let's get on with the scene . . .

[meanwhile, the step-daughter, coming forward again, turns to madame pace.]

the step-daughter. come on, madame, come on!

madame pace [offended]. no, no, grazie. i not do anything witha your mother present.

the step-daughter. nonsense! introduce this "old signore" who wants to talk nicely to me. [addressing the company imperiously.] we've got to do this scene one way or another, haven't we? come on! [to madame pace.] you can go!

madame pace. ah yes! i go'way! i go'way! certainly! [exits furious.]

the step-daughter [to the father]. now you make your entry. no, you needn't go over here

[the father does as he is told, looking troubled and perplexed at first. but as soon as he begins to move, the reality of the action affects him, and he begins to smile and to be more natural. the actors watch intently.]

the manager [sotto voce, quickly to the prompter in his box]. ready! ready? get ready to write now.

the father [coming forward and speaking in a different tone]. good afternoon, miss!

the step-daughter [head bowed down slightly, with restrained disgust]. good afternoon!

the father [looks under her hat which partly covers her face. perceiving she is very young, he makes an exclamation, partly of surprise, partly of fear lest he compromise himself in a risky adventure]. ah . . . but . . . ah . . . i say . . . this is not the first time that you have come here, is it?

the step-daughter [modestly]. no sir.

the father. you've been here before, eh? [then seeing her nod agreement.] more than once

[the mother, who watches the progress of the scene with the son and the other two children who cling to her, is on thorns; and follows with varying expressions of sorrow, indignation, anxiety, and horror the words and actions of the other two. from time to time she hides her face in her hands and sobs.]

the manager [furious]. silence! silence! don't try and be funny, if you please . . . we're playing the scene now i'd have you notice. [to the step-daughter.] begin again, please!

the step-daughter [continuing]. no thank you, sir.

the father. oh, come now. don't talk like that. you must take it. i shall be upset if you don't. there are some lovely little hats here; and then -- madame will be pleased. she expects it, anyway, you know.

the step-daughter. no, no! i couldn't wear it!

the father. oh, you're thinking about what they'd say at home if they saw you come in with a new hat? my dear girl, there's always a way round these little matters, you know.

the step-daughter [all keyed up].

 no, it's not that -- i couldn't wear it because i am . . . as you see . . . you might have noticed . . . [showing her black dress.]

the father. . . . in mourning! of course: i beg your pardon: i'm frightfully sorry . . .

the step-daughter [forcing herself to conquer her indignation and nausea]. stop! stop! it's i who must thank you. there's no need for you to feel mortified or specially sorry. don't think any more of what i've said. [tries to smile.] i must forget that i am dressed so . . .

the manager [interrupting and turning to the prompter]. stop a minute! stop! don't write that down. cut out that last bit. [then to the father and step-daughter.] fine! it's going fine! [to the father only.] and now you can go on as we arran

leading man. still, with a bit of go in it!

leading lady. of course! it's easy enough! [to leading man.] shall you and i try it now?

the step-daughter. but she isn't dressed in black.

leading lady. but i shall be, and much more effectively than you.

the manager [to step-daughter]. be quiet please, and watch! you'll be able to learn something. [clapping his hands.] come on! come on! entrance, please! [the door at rear of stage opens, and the leading man enters with the lively manner of an old gallant. the rendering of the scene by the actors from the very first words is seen to be quite a different thing, though it has not in any way the air of a parody. naturally, the step-daughter and the father, not being able to recognize themselves in the leading lady and the leadi

the manager [furious]. silence! and you please just stop that laughing. if we go on like this, we shall never finish.

the step-daughter. forgive me, sir, but it's natural enough. this lady [indicating leading lady.] stands there still; but if she is supposed to be me, i can assure you that if i heard anyone say "good afternoon" in that manner and in that tone, i should burst out laughing as i did.

the father. yes, yes, the manner, the tone . . .

leading lady. no, sir.

leading man. you've been here before, more than once.

the manager. no, no, stop! let her nod "yes" first. "you've been here before, eh?" [the leading lady lifts up her head slightly and closes her eyes as though in disgust. then she inclines her head twice.]

the step-daughter [unable to contain herself]. oh my god! [puts a hand to her mouth to prevent herself from laughing.]

the step-daughter. nothing, nothing!

the father. yes, i understand . . . i understand . . .

the manager. well then, let's have no more of it! [turning to the actors.] we'll have the rehearsals by ourselves, afterwards, in the ordinary way. i never could stand rehearsing with the author present. he's never satisfied! [turning to father and step-daughter.] come on! let's get on with it again; and try and see if you can't keep from laughing.

the step-daughter. oh, i shan't laugh any more. there's a nice little bit coming for me now: you'll see.

the manager. well then: when she says "don't think any more of what i've said. i must forget, etc.," you [addressing the father.] come in sharp with "i understand, i understand"; and then you ask her . . .

the step-daughter [interrupting]. what?

the manager. why she is in mourning.

the step-daughter.

 not at all! see here: when i told him that it was useless for me to be thinking about my wearing mourning, do you know how he answered me? "ah well," he said, "then let's take off this little frock."

the manager. great! just what we want, to make a riot in the theatre!

the step-daughter. but it's the truth!

the manager. what does that matter? acting is our business here. truth up to a certain point, but no further.

the step-daughter. what do you want to do then?

the manager. you'll see, you'll see! leave it to me.

the step-daughter. no sir! what you want to do is to piece together a little romantic sentimental scene out of my disgust, out of all the reasons, each more cruel and viler than the other, why i am what i am. he is to ask me why i'm in mourning; and i'm to answer with tears in my eyes, that it is just two months since papa died. no sir, no! he's got to say to me; as he did say: "well, let's take off this little

 dress at once." and i; with my two months' mourning in my heart, went there behind that screen, and with these fingers tingling with shame . . .

the manager [running his hands through his hair]. for heaven's sake! what are you saying?

the step-daughter [crying out excitedly]. the truth! the truth!

the manager. it may be. i don't deny it, and i can understand all your horror; but you must surely see that you can't have this kind of thing on the stage. it won't go.

the step-daughter. not possible, eh? very well! i'm much obliged to you -- but i'm off!

the manager. now be reasonable! don't lose your temper!

the step-daughter. i won't stop here! i won't! i can see you've fixed it all up with him in your office. all this talk about what is possible for the stage . . . i understand! he wants to get at his complicated "cerebral drama," to have his famous remorses and torments acted; but i want to act my part, my part!

the manager [annoyed, shaking his shoulders]. ah! just yo

the step-daughter [bowing her head, impressed]. it's true. but remember those others mean him for me all the same.

the manager [not understanding]. what? the others? what do you mean?

the step-daughter. for one who has gone wrong, sir, he who was responsible for the first fault is responsible for all that follow. he is responsible for my faults, was, even before i was born. look at him, and see if it isn't true!

the step-daughter. how? how can he act all his "noble remorses," all his "moral torments," if you want to spare him the horror of being discovered one day -- after he had asked her what he did ask her -- in the arms of her, that already fallen woman, that child, sir, that child he used to watch come out of school? [she is moved.] [the mother at this point is overcome with emotion, and breaks out into a fit of crying. all are touched. a long pause.]

the step-daughter [as soon as the mother becomes a little quieter, adds resolutely and gravely]. at present, we are unknown to the public. tomorrow, you will act us as you wish, treating us in your own manner. but do you really want to see drama, do you want to see it flash out as it really did?

the manager. of course! that's just what i do want, so i can use as much of it as is possible.

the step-daughter. well then, ask that mother there to leave us.

the mother. i can't bear it. i can't.

the manager. but since it has happened already . . . i don't understand!

the mother. it's taking place now. it happens all the time. my torment isn't a pretended one. i live and feel every minute of my torture. those two children there -- have you heard them speak? they can't speak any more. they cling to me to keep up my torment actual and vivid for me. but for themselves, they do not exist, they aren't any more. and she [indicating the step-daughter.] has run away, she has left me, and is lost. if i now see her here before me, it is only to renew for me the tortures i have suffered for her too.

the father. the eternal moment! she [indicating the step-daughter.] is here to catch me, fix me, and hold me eternally in the stocks for that one fleeting and shameful moment of my life. she can't give it up! and you sir, cannot either fairly spare me it.

act iii

when the curtain goes up again, it is seen that the stage hands have shifted the bit of scenery used in the last part, and have rigged up instead at the back of the stage a drop, with some trees, and one or two wings. a portion of a fountain basin is visible. the mother is sitting on the right with the two children by her side. the son is on the same side, but away from the others. he seems bored, angry, and full of shame. the father and the step-daughter are also seated towards the right front. on the other side (left) are the actors, much in the positions they occupied before the curtain was lowered. only the manager is standing up in the middle of the stage, with his hand closed over his mouth in the act of meditating.

the manager [shaking his shoulders after a brief pause]. ah yes: the second act! leave it to me, leave it all to me as we arranged, and you'll see! it'll go fine!

the step-daughter. our entry into his house [indicates father.

the step-daughter. do let it be clear, at any rate, that it is in spite of my wishes.

the mother [from her corner, shaking her head]. for all the good that's come of it . . .

the step-daughter [turning towards her quickly]. it doesn't matter. the more harm done us, the more remorse for him.

the manager [impatiently]. i understand! good heavens! i understand! i'm taking it into account.

the mother [supplicatingly]. i beg you, sir, to let it appear quite plain that for conscience' sake i did try in every way . . .

, because it is true! i enjoy it immensely. any how, as you can see, the meeker she is, the more she tries to get at his heart, the more distant and aloof does he become.

the manager. are we going to begin this second act or not?

the step-daughter. i'm not going to talk any more now- but i must tell you this: you can't have the whole action take place in the garden, as you suggest. it isn't possible!

the manager.. why not?

the step-daughter. because he [indicates the son again.] is always shut up alone in his room. and then there's all the part of that poor dazed-looking boy there which takes place indoors.

the manager. maybe! on the other hand, you will understand -- we can't change scenes three or four times in one act.

the leading man. they used to once.

the manager. yes, when the public was up to the level of that child there.

the leading lady. it makes the illusion easier.

the father [irritated]. the illusion! for heaven

e manager. yes, yes, i know this.

the father. what is there then to marvel at in us? imagine such a misfortune for characters as i have described to you: to be born of an author's fantasy, and be denied life by him; and then answer me if these characters left alive, and yet without life, weren't right in doing what they did do and are doing now, after they have attempted everything in their power to persuade him to give them their stage life. we've all tried him in turn, i, she [indicating the step-daughter.] and she. [indicating the mother.]

the step-daughter. it's true. i too have sought to tempt him, many, many times, when he has been sitting at his writing table, feeling a bit melancholy, at the twilight hour. he would sit in his armchair too lazy to switch on the light, and all the shadows that crept into his room were full of our presence coming to tempt him. [as if she saw herself still there by the writing table, and was annoyed by the presence of the actors.] oh, if you would only go awa

[makes a sudden movement as if in the vision she has of herself illuminating those shadows she wanted to seize hold of herself.] ah! my life! my life! oh, what scenes we proposed to him -- and i tempted him more than any of the others!

the father. maybe. but perhaps it was your fault that he refused to give us life: because you were too insistent, too troublesome.

the step-daughter. . nonsense! didn't he make me so himself? [goes close to the manager to tell him. as if in confidence.] in my opinion he abandoned us in a fit of depression, of disgust for the ordinary theatre as the public knows it and likes it.

the son. exactly what it was, sir; exactly that!

the father. not at all! don't believe it for a minute. listen to me! you'll be doing quite right to modify, as you suggest, the excesses both of this girl here, who wants to do too much, and of this young man, who wo

less.

the father. well, if you want to take away from me the possibility of representing the torment of my spirit which never gives me peace, you will be suppressing me: that's all. every true man, sir, who is a little above the level of the beasts and plants does not live for the sake of living, without knowing how to live; but he lives so as to give a meaning and a value of his own to life. for me this is everything. i cannot give up this, just to represent a mere fact as she [indicating the step-daughter.] wants. it's all very well for her, since her "vendetta" lies in the "fact." i'm not going to do it. it destroys my raison d'être.

the manager. your raison d'être! oh, we're going ahead fine! first she starts off, and then you jump in. at this rate, we'll never finish.

the father. now, don't be offended! have it your own way -- provided, however, that within the limits of the parts you assign us each one's sacrifice isn't too great.

the manager. you've got to understand that you can't go

the father. all right. i'll do just as much arguing and philosophizing as everybody does when he is considering his own torments.

the manager. if the drama permits! but for heaven's sake, man, let's get along and come to the scene.

the step-daughter. it seems to me we've got too much action with our coming into his house. [indicating father.] you said, before, you couldn't change the scene every five minutes.

the manager. of course not. what we've got to do is to combine and group up all the facts in one simultaneous, close-knit, action. we can't have it as you want, with your little brother wandering like a ghost from room to room, hiding behind doors and meditating a project which -- what did you say it did to him?

onsumes him, sir, wastes him away!

the manager. well, it may be. and then at the same time, you want the little girl there to be playing in the garden . . . one in the house, and the other in the garden: isn't that it?

the step-daughter. yes, in the sun, in the sun! that is my only pleasure: to see her happy and careless in the garden after the misery and squalor of the horrible room where we all four slept together. and i had to sleep with her -- i, do you understand? -- with my vile contaminated body next to hers; with her folding me fast in her loving little arms. in the garden, whenever she spied me, she would run to take me by the hand. she didn't care for the big flowers, only the little ones; and she loved to show me th

em and pet me.

the manager. well then, we'll have it in the garden. everything shall happen in the garden; and we'll group the other scenes there. [calls a stage hand.] here, a backcloth with trees and something to do as a fountain basin. [turning round to look at the back of the stage.] ah, you've fixed it up. good! [to step-daughter.] this is just to give an idea, of course. the boy, instead of hiding behind the doors, will wander about here in the garden, hiding behind the trees.. but it's going to be rather difficult to find a child to do that scene with you where she shows you the flowers. [turning to the boy.] come forward a little, will you please? let's try it now! come along! come along! [then seeing him come shyly forward, full of fear and looking lost.] it's a nice business, this lad here. what's the matter with h

im? we'll have to give him a word or two to say. [goes close to him, puts a hand on his shoulders, and leads him behind one of the trees.] come on! come on! let me see you a little! hide here . . . yes, like that. try and show your head just a little as if you were looking for someone . . . [goes back to observe the effect, when the boy at once goes through the action.] excellent! fine! [turning to step-daughter.] suppose the little girl there were to surprise him as he looks round,, and run over to him, so we could give him a word or two to say?

the step-daughter. it's useless to hope he will speak, as long as that fellow there is here . . . [indicates the son.] you must send him away first.

the son [jumping up]. delighted! delighted! i don't ask for anything better. [begins to move away.]

the manager [at once stopping him]. no! no! where are you going? wait a bit!

[the mother gets up alarmed and

terrified at the thought that he is really about to go away. instinctively she lifts her arms to prevent him, without, however, leaving her seat.]

the son [to manager who stops him]. i've got nothing to do with this affair. let me go please! let me go!

the manager. what do you mean by saying you've got nothing to do with this?

the step-daughter [calmly, with irony]. don't bother to stop him: he won't go away.

the father. he has to act the terrible scene in the garden with his mother.

the son [suddenly resolute and with dignity]. i shall act nothing at all. i've said so from the very beginning. [to the manager.] let me go!

the step-daughter [going over to the manager]. allow me? [puts down the manager's arm which is restraining the son.] well, go away then, if you want to! [the son looks at her with contempt and hatred. she laughs a

that mother whose only son he is. [turning to the mother.] come on, mother, come along! [turning to manager to indicate her.] you see, she was getting up to keep him back. [to the mother, beckoning her with her hand.] come on! come on! [then to manager.] you can imagine how little she wants to show these actors of yours what she really feels; but so eager is she to get near him that . . . there, you see? she is willing to act her part. [and in fact, the mother approaches him; and as soon as the step-daughter has finished speaking, opens her arms to signify that she consents.]

the son [suddenly]. no! no! if i can't go away, then i'll stop here; but i repeat: i act nothing!

the father [to manager excitedly]. you can force him, sir.

the son. nobody can force me.

the father. i can.

the step-daughter. wait a minute, wait . . . first of all, the baby has to go to the fountain . . . [runs to take the child and leads her to the fountain.]

the manager. yes, yes of course; that's it. both at the same t

the son. there in the fountain . . .

the father [pointing with tender pity to the mother]. she was following him at the moment . . .

the manager [to the son anxiously]. and then you . . .

the son. i ran over to her; i was jumping in to drag her out when i saw something that froze my blood . . . the boy standing stock still, with eyes like a madman's, watching his little drowned sister, in the fountain! [the step-daughter bends over the fountain to hide the child. she sobs.] then . . . [a revolver shot rings out behind the trees where the boy is hidden.]

the mother [with a cry of terror runs over in that direction together with several of the actors amid general confusion]. my son! my son! [then amid the cries and exclamations one hears her voice.] help! help!

the manager [pushing the actors aside while they lift up the boy and carry him off.] is he really wounded?

some actors. he's dead! dead!

other actors.
