[CHARACTER] - 
                hermia's
father, who brings a complaint against his daughter to theseus:
[CHARACTER] has given demetrius permission to marry hermia, but hermia,
in love with lysander, refuses to marry demetrius. [CHARACTER]'s severe insistence
that hermia either respect his wishes or be held accountable to
athenian law places him squarely outside the whimsical dream realm
of the forest.
