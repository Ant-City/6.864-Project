ng forth fire and belching out a suffocating
smoke. gilgamesh is, however, undaunted and urges enkidu to accompany
him in the adventure.

"i will go down to the forest," says gilgamesh, if the conjectural
restoration of the line in question (l. 126) is correct. enkidu replies
by again drawing a lurid picture of what will happen "when we go
(together) to the forest......." this speech of enkidu is continued on
the reverse. in reply gilgamesh emphasizes his reliance upon the good
will of shamash and reproaches enkidu with cowardice. he declares
himself superior to enkidu's warning, and in bold terms says that
he prefers to perish in the attempt to overcome huwawa rather than
abandon it.


	"wherever terror is to be faced,
	thou, forsooth, art in fear of death.
	thy prowess lacks strength.
	i will go before thee,
	though thy mouth shouts to me: 'thou art afraid to approach,'
	if i fall, i will establish my name." (lines 143-148)


there follows an interesting description o

erech when they see these preparations are stricken
with fear. they learn of huwawa's threat to annihilate gilgamesh if
he dares to enter the cedar forest, and once more try to dissuade
gilgamesh from the undertaking.


	"thou art young, o gish, and thy heart carries thee away,
	thou dost not know what thou proposest to do." (lines 190-191)


they try to frighten gilgamesh by repeating the description of
the terrible huwawa. gilgamesh is still undaunted and prays to his
patron deity shamash, who apparently accords him a favorable "oracle"
(_têrtu_). the two heroes arm themselves for the fray, and the elders
of erech, now reconciled to the perilous undertaking, counsel gilgamesh
to take provision along for the undertaking. they urge gilgamesh to
allow enkidu to take the lead, for


	"he is acquainted with the way, he has trodden the road
	[to] the entrance of the forest." (lines 252-253)


the elders dismiss gilgamesh with fervent wishes that enkidu may track
out the "

closed path" for gilgamesh, and commit him to the care of
lugalbanda--here perhaps an epithet of shamash. they advise gilgamesh
to perform certain rites, to wash his feet in the stream of huwawa and
to pour out a libation of water to shamash. enkidu follows in a speech
likewise intended to encourage the hero; and with the actual beginning
of the expedition against huwawa the tablet ends. the encounter itself,
with the triumph of the two heroes, must have been described in the
fourth tablet.

now before taking up the significance of the additions to our
knowledge of the epic gained through these two tablets, it will be
well to discuss the forms in which the names of the two heroes and
of the ruler of the cedar f

 is neither sumerian nor akkadian;
and we have already suggested that the circumstance that the hero of
the epic is portrayed as a conqueror of erech, and a rather ruthless
one at that, points to a tradition of an invasion of the euphrates
valley as the background for the episode in the first tablet of the
series. now it is significant that many of the names in the "mythical"
dynasties, as they appear in poebel's list, [61] are likewise foreign,
such as mes-ki-in-ga-se-ir, son of the god shamash (and the founder
of the "mythical" dynasty of erech of which dgish-bil-ga-mesh is
the fifth member), [62] and en-me-ir-kár his son. in a still earlier
"mythical" dynasty, we encounter names like ga-lu-mu-um, zu-ga-gi-ib,
ar-pi, e-ta-na, [63] which are distinctly foreign, while such names as
en-me(n)-nun-na and bar-sal-nun-na strike one again as "sumerianized"
names rather than as genuine sumerian formations. [64]

some of these names, as galumum, arpi and etana, are so amoritic

ne who became the favorite hero into the foreground. therefore, in
both the babylonian and the assyrian version enkidu is represented
as hesitating, and gilgamesh as determined to go ahead. gilgamesh,
in fact, accuses enkidu of cowardice and boldly declares that he
will proceed even though failure stare him in the face. [88] traces
of the older view, however, in which gilgamesh is the one for whom
one fears the outcome, crop out; as, for example, in the complaint of
gilgamesh's mother to shamash that the latter has stirred the heart
of her son to take the distant way to hu(m)baba,


	"to a fight unknown to him, he advances,
	an expedition unknown to him he undertakes." [89]


ninsun evidently fears the consequences when her son informs her
of his intention and asks her counsel. the answer of shamash is not
preserved, but no doubt it was of a reassuring character, as was the
answer of the sun-god to gish's appeal and prayer as set forth in
the yale tablet. [90]

primarily "endeavor," and then success in one's endeavor, or "triumph."

lines 266-270. do not appear to refer to rites performed after a
victory, as might at a first glance appear, but merely voice the hope
that gish will completely take possession of huwawa's territory, so
as to wash up after the fight in huwawa's own stream; and the hope
is also expressed that he may find pure water in huwawa's land in
abundance, to offer a libation to shamash.
