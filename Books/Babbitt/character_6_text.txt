by golly have to stay out!" later, when the cigar did go out, he took
one more match from the file, and when a buyer and a seller came in for
a conference at eleven-thirty, naturally he had to offer them cigars.
his conscience protested, "why, you're smoking with them!" but he
bullied it, "oh, shut up! i'm busy now. of course by-and-by--" there was
no by-and-by, yet his belief that he had crushed the unclean habit made
him feel noble and very happy. when he called up paul riesling he was,
in his moral splendor, unusually eager.

he was fonder of paul riesling than of any one on earth except himself
and his daughter tinka. they had been classmates, roommates, in the
state university, but always he thought of paul riesling, with his dark
slimness, his precisely parted hair, his nose-glasses, his hesitant
speech, his moodiness, his love of music, as a younger brother, to be
petted and protected. paul had gone into his father's business,
after graduation; he was now a wholes

but babbitt was virtuous. he advocated, though he did not practise, the
prohibition of alcohol; he praised, though he did not obey, the laws
against motor-speeding; he paid his debts; he contributed to the church,
the red cross, and the y. m. c. a.; he followed the custom of his
clan and cheated only as it was sanctified by precedent; and he never
descended to trickery--though, as he explained to paul riesling:

"course i don't mean to say that every ad i write is literally true or
that i always believe everything i say when i give some buyer a good
strong selling-spiel. you see--you see it's like this: in the first
place, maybe the owner of the property exaggerated when he put it into
my hands, and it certainly isn't my place to go proving my principal
a liar! and then most folks are so darn crooked themselves that they

 i did hear: george's missus went into the
gents' wear department at parcher's to buy him some collars, and before
she could give his neck-size the clerk slips her some thirteens. 'how
juh know the size?' says mrs. babbitt, and the clerk says, 'men that
let their wives buy collars for 'em always wear thirteen, madam.' how's
that! that's pretty good, eh? how's that, eh? i guess that'll about fix
you, george!"

"i--i--" babbitt sought for amiable insults in answer. he stopped,
stared at the door. paul riesling was coming in. babbitt cried, "see you
later, boys," and hastened across the lobby. he was, just then, neither
the sulky child of the sleeping-porch, the domestic tyrant of the
breakfast table, the crafty money-changer of the lyte-purdy conference,
nor the blaring good fellow, the josher and regular guy, of the athletic
club. he was an older brother to paul riesling, swift to defend him,
admiring him with a proud and credulous love passing the love of women.

of spring; that wages were too high and the interest on mortgages too
low; that babe ruth, the eminent player of baseball, was a noble man;
and that "those two nuts at the climax vaudeville theater this week
certainly are a slick pair of actors." babbitt, though ordinarily his
voice was the surest and most episcopal of all, was silent. in the
presence of the slight dark reticence of paul riesling, he was awkward,
he desired to be quiet and firm and deft.

the entrance lobby of the athletic club was gothic, the washroom roman
imperial, the lounge spanish mission, and the reading-room in
chinese chippendale, but the gem of the club was the dining-room, the
masterpiece of ferdinand reitman, zenith's busiest architect. it was
lofty and half-timbered, with tudor leaded casements, an oriel, a
somewhat musicianless musicians'-gallery, and tapestries believed
to illustrate the granting of magna

"great! great idea!" babbitt admired.

not for fourteen years had he taken a holiday without his wife, and
neither of them quite believed they could commit this audacity. many
members of the athletic club did go camping without their wives, but
they were officially dedicated to fishing and hunting, whereas the
sacred and unchangeable sports of babbitt and paul riesling were
golfing, motoring, and bridge. for either the fishermen or the golfers
to have changed their habits would have been an infraction of their
self-imposed discipline which would have shocked all right-thinking and
regularized citizens.

babbitt blustered, "why don't we just put our foot down and say, 'we're
going on ahead of you, and that's all there is to it!' nothing criminal
in it. simply say to zilla--"

"you don't say anything to zilla simply. why, georgie, she's almost as

he forgot paul riesling in an afternoon of not unagreeable details.
after a return to his office, which seemed to have staggered on without
him, he drove a "prospect" out to view a four-flat tenement in the
linton district. he was inspired by the customer's admiration of the new
cigar-lighter. thrice its novelty made him use it, and thrice he hurled
half-smoked cigarettes from the car, protesting, "i got to quit smoking
so blame much!"

their ample discussion of every detail of the cigar-lighter led them

up-to-the-minute and otherwise perfected modern. whenever thompson
twanged, "put your john hancock on that line," babbitt was as much
amused by the antiquated provincialism as any proper englishman by any
american. he knew himself to be of a breeding altogether more esthetic
and sensitive than thompson's. he was a college graduate, he played
golf, he often smoked cigarettes instead of cigars, and when he went
to chicago he took a room with a private bath. "the whole thing is," he
explained to paul riesling, "these old codgers lack the subtlety that
you got to have to-day."

this advance in civilization could be carried too far, babbitt
perceived. noel ryland, sales-manager of the zeeco, was a frivolous
graduate of princeton, while babbitt was a sound and standard ware from
that great department-store, the state university. ryland wore spats,
he wrote long letters about city planning and community singing, and,
though he was a booster, he was known to carry in his pocket small
volumes of poetry in

sidewise for two minutes, up for two minutes, while he muttered, "ought
take more exercise; keep in shape;" then went in to see whether his
collar needed changing before dinner. as usual it apparently did not.

the lettish-croat maid, a powerful woman, beat the dinner-gong.


the roast of beef, roasted potatoes, and string beans were excellent
this evening and, after an adequate sketch of the day's progressive
weather-states, his four-hundred-and-fifty-dollar fee, his lunch with
paul riesling, and the proven merits of the new cigar-lighter, he was
moved to a benign, "sort o' thinking about buyin, a new car. don't
believe we'll get one till next year, but still we might."

verona, the older daughter, cried, "oh, dad, if you do, why don't you
get a sedan? that would be perfectly slick! a closed car is so much more
comfy than an open one."

"well now, i don't know about that. i kind of like an open car. you get
more fresh air that way."

"oh, shoot, that's just because you never tried

the professions. they're too crowded already, and what'll we do for
workmen if all those fellows go and get educated?"

ted was leaning back, smoking a cigarette without reproof. he was, for
the moment, sharing the high thin air of babbitt's speculation as though
he were paul riesling or even dr. howard littlefield. he hinted:

"well, what do you think then, dad? wouldn't it be a good idea if i
could go off to china or some peppy place, and study engineering or
something by mail?"

"no, and i'll tell you why, son. i've found out it's a mighty nice thing
to be able to say you're a b.a. some client that doesn't know what you
are and thinks you're just a plug business man, he gets to shooting off

"i know, dad! sure! all right. i'll stick to it. say! gosh! gee whiz! i
forgot all about those kids i was going to take to the chorus rehearsal.
i'll have to duck!"

"but you haven't done all your home-work."

"do it first thing in the morning."

"well--"

six times in the past sixty days babbitt had stormed, "you will not 'do
it first thing in the morning'! you'll do it right now!" but to-night he
said, "well, better hustle," and his smile was the rare shy radiance he
kept for paul riesling.

"ted's a good boy," he said to mrs. babbitt.

"oh, he is!"

"who's these girls he's going to pick up? are they nice decent girls?"

"i don't know. oh dear, ted never tells me anything any more. i don't
understand what's come over the children of this generation. i used
to have to tell papa and mama everything, but seems like the children
to-day have just slipped away from all control."

"i hope they're decent girls. course ted's no longer a kid, and i
wouldn't want him to, uh, get mixed

my fault as it is theirs. oughtn't to get grouchy like i do. but--wish
i'd been a pioneer, same as my grand-dad. but then, wouldn't have a
house like this. i--oh, gosh, i don't know!"

he thought moodily of paul riesling, of their youth together, of the
girls they had known.

when babbitt had graduated from the state university, twenty-four years
ago, he had intended to be a lawyer. he had been a ponderous debater in
college; he felt that he was an orator; he saw himself becoming governor
of the state. while he read law he worked as a real-estate salesman. he
saved money, lived in a boarding-house, supped on poached egg on hash.

of babbitt's spring were the secret buying of
real-estate options in linton for certain street-traction officials,
before the public announcement that the linton avenue car line would be
extended, and a dinner which was, as he rejoiced to his wife, not only
"a regular society spread but a real sure-enough highbrow affair, with
some of the keenest intellects and the brightest bunch of little women
in town." it was so absorbing an occasion that he almost forgot his
desire to run off to maine with paul riesling.

though he had been born in the village of catawba, babbitt had risen
to that metropolitan social plane on which hosts have as many as four
people at dinner without planning it for more than an evening or two.
but a dinner of twelve, with flowers from the florist's and all the
cut-glass out, staggered even the babbitts.

for two weeks they studied, debated, and arbitrated the list of guests.

babbitt marveled, "of course we're up-to-date ourselves, but still,
think of us entertaining a famous

the others, from their fitful unconvincing talk, their expressions of
being slowly and painfully smothered, seemed to be suffering from the
toil of social life and the horror of good food as much as himself. all
of them accepted with relief the suggestion of bridge.

babbitt recovered from the feeling of being boiled. he won at bridge.
he was again able to endure vergil gunch's inexorable heartiness. but
he pictured loafing with paul riesling beside a lake in maine. it was as
overpowering and imaginative as homesickness. he had never seen maine,
yet he beheld the shrouded mountains, the tranquil lake of evening.
"that boy paul's worth all these ballyhooing highbrows put together," he
muttered; and, "i'd like to get away from--everything."

even louetta swanson did not rouse him.

mrs. swanson was pretty and pliant. babbitt was not an analyst of women,
except as to their tastes in furnished houses to rent. he divided them

"but that's--i've been feeling so jumpy lately, i thought maybe it might
be a good thing if i kind of got off by myself and sweat it out of me."

"george! don't you want me to go along?" she was too wretchedly in
earnest to be tragic, or gloriously insulted, or anything save dumpy and
defenseless and flushed to the red steaminess of a boiled beet.

"of course i do! i just meant--" remembering that paul riesling had
predicted this, he was as desperate as she. "i mean, sometimes it's a
good thing for an old grouch like me to go off and get it out of
his system." he tried to sound paternal. "then when you and the kids
arrive--i figured maybe i might skip up to maine just a few days ahead
of you--i'd be ready for a real bat, see how i mean?" he coaxed her
with large booming sounds, with affable smiles, like a popular preacher

sa, her voice was a
dagger of corroded brass. she was full of the joy of righteousness and
bad temper. she was a crusader and, like every crusader, she exulted
in the opportunity to be vicious in the name of virtue. "let it go? if
people knew how many things i've let go--"

"oh, quit being such a bully."

"yes, a fine figure you'd cut if i didn't bully you! you'd lie abed till
noon and play your idiotic fiddle till midnight! you're born lazy, and
you're born shiftless, and you're born cowardly, paul riesling--"

"oh, now, don't say that, zilla; you don't mean a word of it!" protested
mrs. babbitt.

"i will say that, and i mean every single last word of it!"

"oh, now, zilla, the idea!" mrs. babbitt was maternal and fussy. she
was no older than zilla, but she seemed so--at first. she was placid
and puffy and mature, where zilla, at forty-five, was so bleached and
tight-corseted that you knew only that she was older than she looked.

sold. to them, the romantic hero was no longer the knight, the wandering
poet, the cowpuncher, the aviator, nor the brave young district
attorney, but the great sales-manager, who had an analysis of
merchandizing problems on his glass-topped desk, whose title of nobility
was "go-getter," and who devoted himself and all his young samurai to
the cosmic purpose of selling--not of selling anything in particular,
for or to anybody in particular, but pure selling.

the shop-talk roused paul riesling. though he was a player of violins
and an interestingly unhappy husband, he was also a very able salesman
of tar-roofing. he listened to the fat man's remarks on "the value of
house-organs and bulletins as a method of jazzing-up the boys out on the
road;" and he himself offered one or two excellent thoughts on the use
of two-cent stamps on circulars. then he committed an offense against
the holy law of the clan of good fellows. he became highbrow.

well, great to see you again, old man. what are you--still doing the
same thing?"

some one was always starting a cheer or a college song, and it was
always thinning into silence. despite their resolution to be democratic
they divided into two sets: the men with dress-clothes and the men
without. babbitt (extremely in dress-clothes) went from one group to the
other. though he was, almost frankly, out for social conquest, he sought
paul riesling first. he found him alone, neat and silent.

paul sighed, "i'm no good at this handshaking and 'well, look who's
here' bunk."

"rats now, paulibus, loosen up and be a mixer! finest bunch of boys on
earth! say, you seem kind of glum. what's matter?"

"oh, the usual. run-in with zilla."

"come on! let's wade in and forget our troubles."

he kept paul beside him, but worked toward the spot where charles
mckelvey stood warming his admirers like a furnace.

mckelvey had been the hero of the class of

the babbitts invited the mckelveys to dinner, in early december, and the
mckelveys not only accepted but, after changing the date once or twice,
actually came.

the babbitts somewhat thoroughly discussed the details of the dinner,
from the purchase of a bottle of champagne to the number of salted
almonds to be placed before each person. especially did they mention the
matter of the other guests. to the last babbitt held out for giving
paul riesling the benefit of being with the mckelveys. "good old charley
would like paul and verg gunch better than some highfalutin' willy
boy," he insisted, but mrs. babbitt interrupted his observations with,
"yes--perhaps--i think i'll try to get some lynnhaven oysters," and
when she was quite ready she invited dr. j. t. angus, the oculist, and a
dismally respectable lawyer named maxwell, with their glittering wives.

sneaking about the corner of the house.

"what's the matter, old man?" said babbitt.

"is that you, thin, owld one? gee, ma certainly is on the warpath!
i told her rone and i would jus' soon not be let in on the fiesta
to-night, and she bit me. she says i got to take a bath, too. but, say,
the babbitt men will be some lookers to-night! little theodore in a
dress-suit!"

"the babbitt men!" babbitt liked the sound of it. he put his arm about
the boy's shoulder. he wished that paul riesling had a daughter, so that
ted might marry her. "yes, your mother is kind of rouncing round, all
right," he said, and they laughed together, and sighed together, and
dutifully went in to dress.

the mckelveys were less than fifteen minutes late.

babbitt hoped that the doppelbraus would see the mckelveys' limousine,
and their uniformed chauffeur, waiting in front.

the dinner was well cooked and incredibly plentiful, and mrs. babbitt
had brought out her grandmother's silver candlesticks. babbitt w

his public achievements was the
dun background of office-routine: leases, sales-contracts, lists of
properties to rent. the evenings of oratory and committees and lodges
stimulated him like brandy, but every morning he was sandy-tongued. week
by week he accumulated nervousness. he was in open disagreement with his
outside salesman, stanley graff; and once, though her charms had always
kept him nickeringly polite to her, he snarled at miss mcgoun for
changing his letters.

but in the presence of paul riesling he relaxed. at least once a week
they fled from maturity. on saturday they played golf, jeering, "as
a golfer, you're a fine tennis-player," or they motored all sunday
afternoon, stopping at village lunchrooms to sit on high stools at a
counter and drink coffee from thick cups. sometimes paul came over in
the evening with his violin, and even zilla was silent as the lonely man
who had lost his way and forever crept down unfamiliar roads spun out
his dark soul in music.

, sighed as the fading
light blurred it. he was conscious of life, and a little sad. with no
vergil gunches before whom to set his face in resolute optimism, he
beheld, and half admitted that he beheld, his way of life as incredibly
mechanical. mechanical business--a brisk selling of badly built houses.
mechanical religion--a dry, hard church, shut off from the real life
of the streets, inhumanly respectable as a top-hat. mechanical golf and
dinner-parties and bridge and conversation. save with paul riesling,
mechanical friendships--back-slapping and jocular, never daring to essay
the test of quietness.

he turned uneasily in bed.

he saw the years, the brilliant winter days and all the long sweet
afternoons which were meant for summery meadows, lost in such brittle
pretentiousness. he thought of telephoning about leases, of cajoling men
he hated, of making business calls and waiting in dirty anterooms--hat
on knee, yawning at fly-specked calendars, being polite to office-boys.

 to talking with a salesman
of pianos, and they dined together. babbitt was filled with friendliness
and well-being. he enjoyed the gorgeousness of the dining-room: the
chandeliers, the looped brocade curtains, the portraits of french kings
against panels of gilded oak. he enjoyed the crowd: pretty women, good
solid fellows who were "liberal spenders."

he gasped. he stared, and turned away, and stared again. three tables
off, with a doubtful sort of woman, a woman at once coy and withered,
was paul riesling, and paul was supposed to be in akron, selling
tar-roofing. the woman was tapping his hand, mooning at him and
giggling. babbitt felt that he had encountered something involved
and harmful. paul was talking with the rapt eagerness of a man who is
telling his troubles. he was concentrated on the woman's faded eyes.
once he held her hand and once, blind to the other guests, he puckered
his lips as though he was pretending to kiss her. babbitt had so strong
an impulse to go to paul that he could f

left him, left the hotel, in leisurely calm. but savagely he said
"campbell inn!" to the taxi-driver. he sat agitated on the slippery
leather seat, in that chill dimness which smelled of dust and perfume
and turkish cigarettes. he did not heed the snowy lake-front, the dark
spaces and sudden bright corners in the unknown land south of the loop.

the office of the campbell inn was hard, bright, new; the night clerk
harder and brighter. "yep?" he said to babbitt.

"mr. paul riesling registered here?"

"yep."

"is he in now?"

"nope."

"then if you'll give me his key, i'll wait for him."

"can't do that, brother. wait down here if you wanna."

babbitt had spoken with the deference which all the clan of good fellows
give to hotel clerks. now he said with snarling abruptness:

"i may have to wait some time. i'm riesling's brother-in-law. i'll go up
to his room. d' i look like a sneak-thief?"

his voice was low and not pleasant. with considerable haste the

curb, and ran up the marble steps to
the office of the hon. mr. lucas prout, the mayor. he bribed the mayor's
doorman with a dollar; he was instantly inside, demanding, "you remember
me, mr. prout? babbitt--vice-president of the boosters--campaigned for
you? say, have you heard about poor riesling? well, i want an order on
the warden or whatever you call um of the city prison to take me back
and see him. good. thanks."

in fifteen minutes he was pounding down the prison corridor to a cage
where paul riesling sat on a cot, twisted like an old beggar, legs
crossed, arms in a knot, biting at his clenched fist.

paul looked up blankly as the keeper unlocked the cell, admitted
babbitt, and left them together. he spoke slowly: "go on! be moral!"

babbitt plumped on the couch beside him. "i'm not going to be moral!
i don't care what happened! i just want to do anything i can. i'm glad
zilla got what was coming to her."

paul said argumentatively, "now, don't go jumping on zilla. i've been

his head.

what did he want? wealth? social position? travel? servants? yes, but
only incidentally.

"i give it up," he sighed.

but he did know that he wanted the presence of paul riesling; and from
that he stumbled into the admission that he wanted the fairy girl--in
the flesh. if there had been a woman whom he loved, he would have fled
to her, humbled his forehead on her knees.

he thought of his stenographer, miss mcgoun. he thought of the prettiest
of the manicure girls at the hotel thornleigh barber shop. as he fell
asleep on the davenport he felt that he had found something in life, and
that he had made a terrifying, thrilling break with everything that was

y were proud to find that they were not shocked by such
frank speaking. tanis ventured, "i know you'll understand--i mean--i
don't quite know how to say it, but i do think that girls who pretend
they're bad by the way they dress really never go any farther. they give
away the fact that they haven't the instincts of a womanly woman."

remembering ida putiak, the manicure girl, and how ill she had used him,
babbitt agreed with enthusiasm; remembering how ill all the world had
used him, he told of paul riesling, of zilla, of seneca doane, of the
strike:

"see how it was? course i was as anxious to have those beggars licked to
a standstill as anybody else, but gosh, no reason for not seeing their
side. for a fellow's own sake, he's got to be broad-minded and liberal,
don't you think so?"

beside her, leaned toward him, absorbed him; and in a glorious state of
being appreciated he proclaimed:
