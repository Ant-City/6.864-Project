   the lady with the wild red hair opened the door and came out on the
porch.


   'in the back of my closet.' i said, 'under the floorboards. i put something
there, and i've got to have it.

   'don't be a goose,' he said. 'come and see margaret.

   i did not want to see margaret. i stood there, looking around, and that's
when i saw the face pressed up against an upstairs window next door. it was
a girl's round face, and it looked afraid. i didn't know it then, but that face
belonged to phoebe winterbottom, the girl who had a powerful imagination,
who would become my friend, and who would have all those peculiar things
happen to her.

   not long ago, when i was locked in a car with my grandparents for six
days, i told them the story of phoebe, and when i finished telling them - or
maybe even as i was telling them - i realized that the story of phoebe was
like the plaster wall in our old house in bybanks, kentucky.

   my father started chipping away at a plaster wall in the living room of our

   but gramps said, 'how about a story? spin us a yam.'

   i certainly do know heaps of stories, but i learned most of them from
gramps gram suggested i tell one about my mother. that, i could not do. i
had just reached the point where i could stop thinking about her every
minute of every day. i wasn't ready - or at least i did not think i was ready -
to talk about her.

   gramps said, 'well, then, what about your friends? you got any tales to
tell about them?'

   instantly, phoebe winterbottom came to mind. there was certainly a hog's
bellyful of things to tell about her. 'i could tell you an extensively strange
story,' i warned.

   'oh, good!' gram said. 'delicious!' and that is how i happened to suspend
my tree prayers and tell them about phoebe winterbottom, her disappearing
mother, and the lunatic. it is also how i discovered that beneath phoebe's
story was another story.

   because i first saw phoebe on the day my father and i moved to euclid, i
began my story of

one girl, mary lou finney, said the most peculiar things, like out
of the blue she would say, 'omnipotent!' or 'beef brain!' i couldn't make any
sense of it. there were japanese twins (a brother and sister), who didn't
speak at all except to say 'yes, yes,' and 'yes, yes.' there were megan and
christy who jumped up and down like parched peas, moody beth ann, and
pink-cheeked alex. there was ben who drew cartoons all day long, and a
most peculiar teacher named mr. birkway.

   and then there was phoebe winterbottom. ben called her 'free-bee ice
bottom' and drew a picture of a bumble-bee with an ice cube on its bottom.
phoebe tore it up.

   phoebe was a quiet girl. she stayed mostly by herself and seemed quite
shy. she had the most pleasant face and huge, enormous sky-blue eyes.
around this pleasant round face, her hair curled in short ringlets as yellow as
a crow's foot.

   during that first week, when my father and i were at margaret's (we ate
dinner there three times the first week), i saw phoebe's fa

phoebe.

   phoebe looked at me, and i pushed her a little closer. mrs. partridge put
her fingers up to phoebe's face and mashed around gently over her eyelids
and down her cheeks. then she said, 'just as i thought. it's two eyes, a nose
and a mouth.' then she laughed a wicked laugh that sounded as if it was
bouncing off jagged rocks. 'you're thirteen years old.'

   'yes' phoebe said.

   'i knew it,' mrs. partridge said. 'i just knew it.' she patted her yellow
feather boa.

   'this is phoebe winterbottom,' i said. 'she lives right next door to you.

   when we left, phoebe whispered, 'i wish you hadn't done that. i wish you
hadn't told her i lived next door.

   'why not? you don't seem to know mrs. cadaver and mrs. partridge very
well--'

   'they haven't lived there very long. only a month or so.'

   'don't you think it's remarkable that she guessed your age like that?'

   'i don't see what is so remarkable about it,' phoebe said. before i could
explain, she started telling me about the tim

   gramps pulled out his wallet. 'if you need some cash--'


   'oh, thank you,' she said. 'that's very kind of you, but i'm all set. thank
you for - for' - she looked around at all the pieces of her car - 'for everything.
i'm sure you have to be on your way.

   and, once gramps was satisfied that the mechanic was an honest man who
might actually be able to repair her car, we started on our trip again.

   'salamanca,' gram said, 'tell us more about peeby.'

   'phoebe,' i said.' phoebe winterbottom.'

   'yes, that's right,' gram said. 'peeby.'

   'what was the diabolic thing that happened to mr. cadaver?' gramps
asked. 'you didn't tell us that yet.'

   i explained that just as phoebe was going to divulge the purely awful thing
that had happened to mr. cadaver, her father came home from work and we
all sat down to dinner: me, phoebe, mr. and mrs. winterbottom, and
phoebe's sister, prudence.

   phoebe's parents reminded me a lot of my other grandparents - the

og. 'i'll see mr.
winterbottom then,' he said.

   'sorry,' phoebe said. 'there are scads and scads of other people here, but
no mr. winterbottom either.

   'is mrs. winterbottom your mother?' he asked.

   'yes' phoebe said. 'would you like me to leave a message?'

   the little pink circles on his cheeks became even pinker. 'no!' he said. 'no.
i don't think so. no.' he looked up and down the street and then up at the
number above the door.

   'what's your name?' he asked.

   'phoebe.'

   'phoebe winterbottom?'

   'that's right.'


   he repeated her name. 'phoebe winterbottom.' i thought he was going to
make a joke about her name, but he didn't. he glanced at me. 'are you a
winterbottom too?' he asked.

   'no,' i said. 'i'm a visitor.

   and then he left. he just turned around, walked slowly down the porch
steps and on down the street. we waited until he had turned the corner
before we left. we ran all the way to mary lou's phoebe was certain that the
young man was going to ambush us. honestly.

crows, sly coyotes, and shadow souls her favourite stories were those about
people who came back, after death, as a bird or a river or a horse. she even
knew one story about an old warrior who came back as a potato.

   the next thing i knew, mr. birkway was saying, 'right phoebe? phoebe?
are you awake? you have the second report.

   'report?' phoebe said.

   'lucky you! we're letting you go second!'

   'report?'

   mr. birkway clutched his heart and said to the class, 'apparently, miss
phoebe winterbottom did not hear me explain about the reports perhaps you
can enlighten her, mr. finney.

   ben turned slowly around in his chair and cast his sparkling black eyes in
phoebe's direction. he said, 'i'm doing an oral report on prometheus this
friday. you're doing one on pandora next monday.'

   'lucky me,' phoebe muttered. mr. birkway asked me to stay after class for
a minute. phoebe sent me warning messages with her eyebrows. as
everyone else was leaving the room, phoebe said, 'i'll stay with you

y lou and ben. my brain was a mess,
what with trying not to flinch whenever ben brushed against me. when we
left ben and mary lou and turned the corner into phoebe's street, i wasn't
paying much attention. i suppose i was aware that someone was coming
along the sidewalk in our direction, but it wasn't until the person was about
three feet away that i really took notice.

   it was phoebe's lunatic, coming toward us, staring right at us. he stopped
directly in front of us, blocking our way.

   'phoebe winterbottom, right?' he said to phoebe. her voice was a little
squeak. the only sound that came out was a tiny 'erp...

   'what's the matter, phoebe winterbottom?' he said. he slid one hand into
his pocket.


   phoebe pushed him, yanked my arm, and started running. 'oh - my - god!'
she said. 'oh - my - god!'

   i was grateful that we were nearly at phoebe's house, so if he stabbed us in
broad daylight, maybe one of her neighbors would discover our bodies and
take us to the hospital before we bled entir

ould she-

   'phoebe, calm down. i don't know why she phoned mrs. cadaver. i haven't
been able to speak to mrs. cadaver myself yet. she isn't home. she left a
note here.' he showed it to phoebe.

   the note said, norma called to say she is ok. beneath mrs. cadaver's
signature was a p.s. saying that mrs. cadaver would be away until monday.


   'i don't believe that mom called mrs. cadaver. mrs. cadaver is making it
up. she probably killed her and chopped her up and buried her under the-

   'phoebe winterbottom--'

   'i'm calling the police.' phoebe said.

   they had a huge argument, but at last phoebe fizzled out. her father said
he had been calling everyone he could think of to see if her mother had
indicated where she might be going. he would continue calling tomorrow,
he promised, and he would speak with mrs. cadaver first thing on monday.
if he did not receive a letter - or a direct phone call - from her mother by
wednesday, he would call the police.
