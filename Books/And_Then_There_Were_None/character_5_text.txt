" 

damn the smooth little brute, he had smiled! it was as though he knew very well 
that in lombard's past actions legality had not always been a sine qua non... 

lombard's own lips parted in a grin. 

by jove, he'd sailed pretty near the wind once or twice! but he'd always got away 
with it! there wasn't much he drew the line at really... 

no, there wasn't much he'd draw the line at. he fancied that he was going to 
enjoy himself at indian island...

in a non-smoking carriage miss emily brent sat very upright as was her custom. 
she was sixty-five and she did not approve of lounging. her father, a colonel of 
the old school, had been particular about deportment. 

the present generation was shamelessly lax - in their carriage, and in every 
other way... 



enveloped in an aura of righteousness and unyielding principles, miss brent sat 
in her crowded third-class carriage and triumphed over its discomfort and its 
heat. every one made such a fuss over things nowadays! they wanted in

there is really an opening for a place where there is good plain cooking and a nice 
old-fashioned type of person. none of this nudity and gramophones half the 
night. i shall be very glad if you could see your way to spending your summer 
holiday on indian island - quite free - as my guest. would early in august suit 
you? perhaps the 8th. 



yours sincerely. 



u.n. 



what was the name? the signature was rather difficult to read. emily brent 
thought impatiently: "so many people write their signatures quite illegibly." 

she let her mind run back over the people at bellhaven. she had been there two 
summers running. there had been that nice middle-aged woman - mrs. - mrs. - 
now what was her name? - her father had been a canon. and there had been a 
miss olton - ormen - no, surely it was oliver! yes - oliver. 

indian island! there had been things in the paper about indian island - 
something about a film star - or was it an americ

an millionaire? 

of course often those places went very cheap - islands didn't suit everybody. they 
thought the idea was romantic but when they came to live there they realized the 
disadvantages and were only too glad to sell. 

emily brent thought to herself: "i shall be getting a free holiday at any rate." 

with her income so much reduced and so many dividends not being paid, that 
was indeed something to take into consideration. if only she could remember a 
little more about mrs. - or was it miss - oliver?

mr. blore was in the slow train from plymouth. there was only one other person 
in his carriage, an elderly seafaring gentleman with a bleary eye. at the present 
moment he had dropped off to sleep. 

mr. blore was writing carefully in a little notebook. 



"that's the lot," he muttered to himself. "emily brent, vera claythorne, dr. 
armstrong, anthony marston, old justice wargrave, philip lombard, general 
macarthur, c.m.g., d.s.o. manservant and wife: mr. and mrs. rogers." 

he closed the notebook and put it back in his pocket. he glanced over at the 
corner and the slumbering man. 

"had one over the eight." diagnosed mr. blore accurately. he went over things 
carefully and conscientiously in his mind. 



"job ought to be easy enough," he ruminated. "don't see how i can slip up on it.

 were sitting. there was the 
hunched elderly figure of the judge, the upright form of miss brent, and a third 
man - a big bluff man who came forward and introduced himself. 

"thought we might as well wait for you," he said. "make one trip of it. allow me 
to introduce myself. name's davis. natal, south africa's my natal spot, ha, ha!" 

he laughed breezily. 

mr. justice wargrave looked at him with active malevolence. he seemed to be 
wishing that he could order the court to be cleared. miss emily brent was clearly 
not sure if she liked colonials. 

"any one care for a little nip before we embark?" asked mr. davis hospitably. 

nobody assenting to this proposition, mr. davis turned and held up a finger. 

"mustn't delay, then. our good host and hostess will be expecting us," he said. 

he might have noticed that a curious constraint came over the other members of 
the party. it was as though the mention of their host and hostess had a curiously 
paralyzing effect upon the guests.

 to them. his rolling gait 
proclaimed him a man of the sea. he had a weather-beaten face and dark eyes 
with a slightly evasive expression. he spoke in his soft devon voice. 



"will you be ready to be starting for the island, ladies and gentlemen? the boat's 
waiting. there's two gentlemen coming by car, but mr. owen's orders was not to 
wait for them as they might arrive at any time." 

the party got up. their guide led them along a small stone jetty. alongside it a 
motor boat was lying. 

emily brent said: 

"that's a very small boat." 

the boat's owner said persuasively: 



"she's a fine boat, that, ma'am. you could go to plymouth in her as easy as 
winking." 

mr. justice wargrave said sharply: 

"there are a good many of us." 

"she'd take double the number, sir." 

philip lombard said in his pleasant easy voice: 

"it's quite all right. glorious weather - no swell." 

rather doubtfully, miss brent permitted herself to be helped into the boat. the 
others followed suit. there was as ye

as the gong sounded, philip lombard came out of his room and walked to the 
head of the stairs. he moved like a panther, smoothly and noiselessly. there was 
something of the panther about him altogether. a beast of prey - pleasant to the 
eye. 



he was smiling to himself. 



a week - eh? 



he was going to enjoy that week.

in her bedroom, emily brent, dressed in black silk ready for dinner, was reading 
her bible. 

her lips moved as she followed the words: 

"the heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid 
is their own foot taken. the lord is known by the judgement which he executeth: 
the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. the wicked shall be turned 
into hell." 

her tight lips closed. she shut the bible. 

rising, she pinned a cairngorm brooch at her neck, and went down to dinner.

vera leaned forward. 

"i wonder. how many are there? ten?" 

"yes - ten there are." 

vera cried: 

"what fun! they're the ten little indian boys of the nursery rhyme, i suppose. in 
my bedroom the rhyme is framed and hung up over the mantelpiece." 

lombard said: 

"in my room, too." 

"and mine." 

"and mine." 



everybody joined the chorus. vera said: 

"it's an amusing idea, isn't it?" 

mr. justice wargrave grunted: 

"remarkably childish," and helped himself to port. 

emily brent looked at vera claythorne. vera claythorne looked at miss brent. 
the two women rose. 

in the drawing-room, the french windows were open onto the terrace and the 
sound of the sea murmuring against the rocks came up to them. 

emily brent said: "pleasant sound." 

vera said sharply: "i hate it." 

miss brent's eyes looked at her in surprise. vera flushed. she said, more 
composedly: 

"i don't think this place would be very agreeable in a storm." 

emily brent agreed. 

"i've no doubt the hous

e is shut up in winter," she said. "you'd never get servants 
to stay here for one thing." 

vera murmured: 

"it must be difficult to get servants anyway." 



emily brent said: 

"mrs. oliver has been lucky to get these two. the woman's a good cook." 

vera thought: 

"funny how elderly people always get names wrong." 

she said: 

"yes, i think mrs. owen has been very lucky indeed." 

emily brent had brought a small piece of embroidery out of her bag. now, as she 
was about to thread her needle, she paused. 

she said sharply: 

"owen? did you say owen?" 

"yes." 

emily brent said sharply: 

"i've never met any one called owen in my life." 

vera stared. 

"but surely -" 



she did not finish her sentence. the door opened and the men joined them. 
rogers followed them into the room with the coffee tray. 

the judge came and sat down by emily brent. armstrong came up to vera. tony

rogers, his face white, his hands shaking, murmured: 

"yes, sir," and slipped quickly out of the room. 



vera cried out: 

"who was that speaking? where was he? it sounded - it sounded -" 

general macarthur spluttered out: 

"what's going on here? what kind of a practical joke was that?" 

his hand was shaking. his shoulders sagged. he looked suddenly ten years older. 

blore was mopping his face with a handkerchief. 

only mr. justice wargrave and miss brent seemed comparatively unmoved. 
emily brent sat upright, her head held high. in both cheeks was a spot of hard 
colour. the judge sat in his habitual pose, his head sunk down into his neck. 
with one hand he gently scratched his ear. only his eyes were active, darting 
round and round the room, puzzled, alert with intelligence. 

again it was lombard who acted. armstrong being busy with the collapsed 
woman, lombard was free once more to take the initiative. 

he said: 

"that voice? it sounded as though it were in the room."

wargrave looked at lombard. 

"was there a title on it?" 

lombard nodded. he grinned suddenly, showing his white pointed teeth. 

he said: 



"quite right, sir. it was entitled swan song..." 



ill 

general macarthur broke out suddenly. he exclaimed: 

"the whole thing is preposterous - preposterous! slinging accusations about like 
this! something must be done about it. this fellow owen whoever he is -" 

emily brent interrupted. she said sharply: 

"that's just it, who is he?" 



the judge interposed. he spoke with the authority that a life-time in the courts 
had given him. he said: 

"that is exactly what we must go into very carefully. i should suggest that you 
get your wife to bed first of all, rogers. then come back here." 

"yes, sir." 

dr. armstrong said: 

"i'll give you a hand, rogers." 

leaning on the two men, mrs. rogers tottered out of the room. when they had 
gone tony marston said:

lombard said: 

i agree. 

tony said: 

"i'll go and forage." 

he went out of the room. 

he returned a second or two later. 

"found them all waiting on a tray outside ready to be brought in." 

he set down his burden carefully. the next minute or two was spent in 
dispensing drinks. general macarthur had a stiff whiskey and so did the judge. 
every one felt the need of a stimulant. only emily brent demanded and obtained 
a glass of water. 

dr. armstrong re-entered the room. 

"she's all right," he said. "i've given her a sedative to take. what's that, a drink? i 
could do with one." 

several of the men refilled their glasses. a moment or two later rogers re- 
entered the room. 

mr. justice wargrave took charge of the proceedings. the room became an 
impromptu court of law. 

the judge said: 



"now then, rogers, we must get to the bottom of this. who is this mr. owen?" 

rogers stared

suggestive point." 

he looked round at the others and thrusting his neck forward like an angry 
tortoise, he said: 

"i think the time has come for us all to pool our information. it would be well, i 
think, for everybody to come forward with all the information they have 
regarding the owner of this house." he paused and then went on. "we are all his 
guests. i think it would be profitable if each one of us were to explain exactly how 
that came about." 

there was a moment's pause and then emily brent spoke with decision. 



"there's something very peculiar about all this," she said. "i received a letter 
with a signature that was not very easy to read. it purported to be from a woman 
i had met at a certain summer resort two or three years ago. i took the name to 
be either ogden or oliver. i am acquainted with a mrs. oliver and also with a 
miss ogden. i am quite certain that i have never met, or become friendly with, 
any one of the name of owen." 

mr. justice wargrave said: 

"you have

o knocked out the night watchman. the case was 
quite clear against him." 

wargrave said slowly: 

"you were complimented, i think, on your able handling of the case." 



blore said sulkily: 

"i got my promotion." 

he added in a thick voice: 

"i was only doing my duty." 

lombard laughed - a sudden ringing laugh. he said: 

"what a duty-loving, law-abiding lot we all seem to be! myself excepted. what 
about you, doctor - and your little professional mistake? illegal operation, was 

it?" 

emily brent glanced at him in sharp distaste and drew herself away a little. 

dr. armstrong, very much master of himself, shook his head good-humouredly. 

"i'm at a loss to understand the matter," he said. "the name meant nothing to me 
when it was spoken. what was it - clees? close? i really can't remember having a 
patient of that name, or being connected with a death in any way. the thing's a 
complete mystery to me. of course, it's a long time ago. it might possibly be one

his head. 

he thought: 

"drunk - that's what it was - drunk... and i operated! nerves all to pieces - hands 
shaking. i killed her, all right. poor devil - elderly woman - simple job if i'd been 



sober. lucky for me there's loyalty in our profession. the sister knew, of course - 
but she held her tongue, god, it gave me a shock! pulled me up. but who could 
have known about it - after all these years?" 



iv 

there was a silence in the room. everybody was looking, covertly or openly, at 
emily brent. it was a minute or two before she became aware of the expectation. 
her eyebrows rose on her narrow forehead. she said: 

"are you waiting for me to say something? i have nothing to say." 

the judge said: 

"nothing, miss brent?" 

"nothing." 

her lips closed tightly. 

the judge stroked his face. he said mildly: 

"you reserve your defence?" 

miss brent said coldly: 

"there is no question of defence. i have always acted in accordance with the 
dictates of my conscience. i have nothing wit

h which to reproach myself." 



there was an unsatisfied feeling in the air. but emily brent was not one to be 
swayed by public opinion. she sat unyielding. 

the judge cleared his throat once or twice. then he said: 

"our inquiry rests there. now, rogers, who else is there on this island besides 
ourselves and you and your wife?" 

"nobody, sir. nobody at all." 



"you're sure of that?" 

"quite sure, sir." 

wargrave said: 

"i am not yet clear as to the purpose of our unknown host in getting us to 
assemble here. but in my opinion this person, whoever he may be, is not sane in

drinking. 

general macarthur said: 

"dead: d'you mean the fellow just choked and - and died?" 

the physician said: 



"you can call it choking if you like. he died of asphyxiation right enough." 

he was sniffing now at the glass. he dipped a finger into the dregs and very 
cautiously just touched the finger with the tip of his tongue. 

his expression altered. 

general macarthur said: 

"never knew a man could die like that -just of a choking fit!" 

emily brent said in a clear voice: 

"in the midst of life we are in death." 

dr. armstrong stood up. he said brusquely: 

"no, a man doesn't die of a mere choking fit. marston's death wasn't what we call 
a natural death." 

vera said almost in a whisper: 

"was there - something - in the whiskey?" 

armstrong nodded. 

"yes. can't say exactly. everything points to one of the cyanides. no distinctive 
smell of prussic acid, probably potassium cyanide. it acts pretty well 
instantaneously. "

"you know, doctor, it doesn't seem right to me. i shouldn't have said mr. marston

armstrong answered: 

i agree.

they had left it like that. what else was there to say? 

together armstrong and lombard had carried the inert body of anthony 
marston to his bedroom and had laid him there covered over with a sheet. 



when they came downstairs again, the others were standing in a group, 
shivering a little, though the night was not cold. 

emily brent said: 

"we'd better go to bed. it's late." 



it was past twelve o'clock. the suggestion was a wise one - yet every one 
hesitated. it was as though they clung to each other's company for reassurance. 

the judge said: 

"yes, we must get some sleep." 

rogers said: 

"i haven't cleared yet - in the dining-room." 

lombard said curtly: 

"do it in the morning." 

armstrong said to him: 

"is your wife all right?" 

"i'll go and see, sir." 

he returned a minute or two later.

and now - this evening - a hidden voice had blared out that old hidden story. 

had he dealt with it all right? kept a stiff upper lip? betrayed the right amount 
of feeling - indignation, disgust - but no guilt, no discomfiture? difficult to tell. 

surely nobody could have taken the accusation seriously. there had been a pack 
of other nonsense, just as far-fetched. that charming girl - the voice had accused 
her of drowning a child! idiotic! some madman throwing crazy accusations about! 

emily brent, too - actually a niece of old tom brent of the regiment. it had 
accused her of murder! any one could see with half an eye that the woman was 
as pious as could be - the kind that was hand and glove with parsons. 

damned curious business the whole thing! crazy, nothing less. 

ever since they had got there - when was that? why, damn it, it was only this 
afternoon! seemed a good bit longer than that. 

he thought: "i wonder when we shall get away again."

who was it that he had to kill? 

he couldn't remember. but he must know! should he ask sister? 

sister was watching him. no, he couldn't ask her. she was suspicious, he could 
see that. 

but who was it on the operating table? 

they shouldn't have covered up the face like that... 

if he could only see the face... 

ah! that was better. a young probationer was pulling off the handkerchief. 

emily brent, of course. it was emily brent that he had to kill. 

how malicious her eyes were! her lips were moving. what was she saying? 

"in the midst of life we are in death..." 

she was laughing now. no, nurse, don't put the handkerchief back. i've got to 
see. i've got to give the anaesthetic. where's the ether? i must have brought the 
ether with me. what have you done with the ether, sister? chbteau neuf du

take the handkerchief away, nurse. 



of course!

"squally - eh?" 

from below them came the boom of a gong. 

philip lombard said: 

"breakfast? well, i could do with some." 

as they went down the steep slope blore said to lombard in a ruminating voice: 

"you know, it beats me - why that young fellow wanted to do himself in! i've been 
worrying about it all night." 

vera was a little ahead. lombard hung back slightly. he said: 

"got any alternative theory?" 

"i'd want some proof. motive, to begin with. well-off i should say he was." 

emily brent came out of the drawing-room window to meet them. 

she said sharply: 

"is the boat coming?" 



"not yet," said vera. 

they went in to breakfast. there was a vast dish of eggs and bacon on the 
sideboard and tea and coffee. 

rogers held the door open for them to pass in, then shut it from the outside. 

emily brent said: 

"that man looks ill this morning." 

dr. armstrong, who was standing by the window, cleared his throat. he said: 

"you must excuse any - er - shortcomings this morning.

rogers has had to do the 
best he can for breakfast single-handed. mrs. rogers has - er - not been able to

emily brent said sharply: 



"what's the matter with the woman?" 

dr. armstrong said easily: 

"let us start our breakfast. the eggs will be cold. afterwards, there are several 
matters i want to discuss with you all." 

they took the hint. plates were filled, coffee and tea was poured. the meal 
began. 



discussion of the island was, by mutual consent, tabooed. they spoke instead in 
a desultory fashion of current events. the news from abroad, events in the world 
of sport, the latest reappearance of

 the cause of death?" 

armstrong shrugged his shoulders. 

"impossible to say offhand." 

"there must be an autopsy?" 

"i certainly couldn't give a certificate. i have no knowledge whatsoever of the 
woman's state of health." 



vera said: 

"she was a very nervous-looking creature. and she had a shock last night. it 
might have been heart failure, i suppose?" 

dr. armstrong said drily: 

"her heart certainly failed to beat - but what caused it to fail is the question." 

one word fell from emily brent. it fell hard and clear into the listening group. 

"conscience!" she said. 

armstrong turned to her. 

"what exactly do you mean by that, miss brent?" 

emily brent, her lips tight and hard, said: 

"you all heard. she was accused, together with her husband, of having 
deliberately murdered her former employer - an old lady." 

"and you think?" 

emily brent said: 

"i think that that accusation was true. you all saw her last night. she broke 
down completely and fainted. the shock of having

her wickedness brought home 
to her was too much for her. she literally died of fear." 

dr. armstrong shook his head doubtfully. 



"it is a possible theory," he said. "one cannot adopt it without more exact 
knowledge of her state of health. if there was cardiac weakness -" 

emily brent said quietly. 

"call it, if you prefer, an act of god." 

every one looked shocked. mr. blore said uneasily: 

"that's carrying things a bit far, miss brent." 

she looked at them with shining eyes. her chin went up. she said: 

"you regard it as impossible that a sinner should be struck down by the wrath of 
god! i do not!" 

the judge stroked his chin. he murmured in a slightly ironic voice: 

"my dear lady, in my experience of ill-doing, providence leaves the work of

ement to us mortals - and the process is often fraught with 
difficulties. there are no short cuts." 

emily brent shrugged her shoulders. 

blore said sharply: 

"what did she have to eat and drink last night after she went up to bed?" 

armstrong said: 



"nothing." 

"she didn't take anything? a cup of tea? a drink of water? i'll bet you she had a 
cup of tea. that sort always does." 

"rogers assures me she had nothing whatsoever." 

"ah," said blore. "but he might say so!" 

his tone was so significant that the doctor looked at him sharply. 

philip lombard said:

rogers came nearer. 



"that's just it, sir. last night, when i was clearing up, there wasn't but nine, sir. 
i noticed it and thought it queer. but that's all i thought. and now, sir, this 
morning. i didn't notice when i laid the breakfast. i was upset and all that. 

"but now, sir, when i came to clear away. see for yourself if you don't believe me. 

"there's only eight, sir! only eight! it doesn't make sense, does it? only eight..." 



chapter 7 



after breakfast, emily brent had suggested to vera claythorne that they should 
walk up to the summit again and watch for the boat. vera had acquiesced. 

the wind had freshened. small white crests were appearing on the sea. there 
were no fishing boats out - and no sign of the motor boat. 

the actual village of sticklehaven could not be seen, only the hill above it, a 
jutting-out cliff of red rock concealed the actual little bay. 

emily brent said: 

"the man who brought us out yesterday seemed a dependable sort of per
 
 ___________________________
 
son. it is 
really very odd that he should be so late this morning." 

vera did not answer. she was fighting down a rising feeling of panic. 

she said to herself angrily: 

"you must keep cool. this isn't like you. you've always had excellent nerves." 

aloud she said after a minute or two: 

"i wish he would come. i - 1 want to get away." 

emily brent said drily: 

"i've no doubt we all do." 

vera said: 



"it's all so extraordinary... there seems no - no meaning in it all." 

the elderly woman beside her said briskly: 

"i'm very annoyed with myself for being so easily taken in. really that letter is 
absurd when one comes to examine it. but i had no doubts at the time - none at 
all." 

vera murmured mechanically: 

"i suppose not." 

"one takes things for granted too much," said emily brent. 

vera drew a deep shuddering breath. 

she s

aid: 

"do you really think - what you said at breakfast?" 

"be a little more precise, my dear. to what in particular are you referring?" 

vera said in a low voice: 

"do you really think that rogers and his wife did away with that old lady?" 

emily brent gazed thoughtfully out to sea. then she said: 

"personally, i am quite sure of it. what do you think?" 



i don't know what to think." 



emily brent said: 

"everything goes to support the idea. the way the woman fainted. and the man 
dropped the coffee tray, remember. then the way he spoke about it - it didn't ring 
true. oh, yes, i'm afraid they did it." 

vera said: 

"the way she looked - scared of her own shadow! i've never seen a woman look so 
frightened... she must have been always haunted by it..." 

miss brent murmured: 

"i remember a text that hung in my nursery as a child. 'be sure thy sin will find 
thee out.' it's very true, 
 
 ___________________________
 
that. 'be sure thy sin will find thee out.'" 

vera scrambled to her feet. she said: 

"but, miss brent - miss brent - in that case -" 

"yes, my dear?" 

"the others? what about the others?" 



"i don't quite understand you." 

"all the other accusations - they - they weren't true? but if it's true about the 
rogerses -" she stopped, unable to make her chaotic thought clear. 

emily brent's brow, which had been frowning perplexedly, cleared. 



she said: 

"ah, i understand you now. well, there is that mr. lombard. he admits to having 
abandoned twenty men to their deaths." 

vera said: 

"they were only natives..." 

emily brent said sharply: 

"black or white, they are our brothers." 

vera thought: 

"our black brothers - our black brothers. oh, i'm going to laugh. i'm hysterical.

"what happened - to her?" 

miss brent said: 

"the abandoned creature, not content with having one sin on her conscience, 
committed a still graver sin. she took her own life." 

vera whispered, horror-struck: 

"she killed herself?" 



"yes, she threw herself into the river." 

vera shivered. 

she stared at the calm delicate profile of miss brent. she said: 

"what did you feel like when you knew she'd done that? weren't you sorry? 
didn't you blame yourself?" 

emily brent drew herself up. 

"i? i had nothing with which to reproach myself." 

vera said: 

"but if your - hardness - drove her to it" 

emily brent said sharply: 

"her own action - her own sin - that was what drove her to it. if she had behaved 
like a decent modest young woman none of this would have happened." 

she turned her face to vera. there was no self-reproach, no uneasiness in those 
eyes. they were hard and self-righteous. emily brent sat on the summit of 
indian island, encased in her own

he started off briskly down to the house. 

lombard stared up at the sky. the clouds were beginning to mass themselves 
together. the wind was increasing. 

he shot a sideways look at armstrong. he said: 

"you're very silent, doctor. what are you thinking?" 

armstrong said slowly: 

"i was wondering exactly how mad old macarthur was..."

vera had been restless all the morning. she had avoided emily brent with a kind 
of shuddering aversion. 

miss brent herself had taken a chair just round the corner of the house so as to 
be out of the wind. she sat there knitting. 

every time vera thought of her she seemed to see a pale drowned face with 
seaweed entangled in the hair... a face that had once been pretty - impudently 
pretty perhaps - and which was now beyond the reach of pity or terror. 

and emily brent, placid and righteous, sat knitting. 

on the main terrace, mr. justice wargrave sat hud

mr. justice wargrave came in. he walked with a slow measured tread. he darted 
quick looks from under his bushy eyebrows at the other occupants of the dining- 
room. he said: 

"you have had an active morning." 

there was a faint malicious pleasure in his voice. 

vera claythorne hurried in. she was a little out of breath. 

she said quickly: 

"i hope you didn't wait for me. am i late?" 



emily brent said: 

"you're not the last. the general isn't here yet." 

they sat round the table. 

rogers addressed miss brent: 

"will you begin, madam, or will you wait?" 

vera said: 

"general macarthur is sitting right down by the sea. i don't expect he would hear 
the gong there and anyway" - she hesitated - "he's a little vague today, i think." 

rogers said quickly: 

"i will go down and inform him luncheon is ready." 

dr. armstrong jumped up. 

"i'll go," he said. "you others start lunch."

he paused - and looked round. 

"do i take it that you all agree?" 

armstrong said: 

"it's fantastic - but i suppose you're right." 

blore said: 

"not a doubt of it. and if you ask me, i've a very good idea -" 



a quick gesture of mr. justice wargrave's hand stopped him. the judge said 
quietly: 

"we will come to that presently. at the moment all i wish to establish is that we 
are in agreement on the facts." 

emily brent, still knitting, said: 

"your argument seems logical. i agree that one of us is possessed by a devil." 

vera murmured: 



"i can't believe it... i can't..." 

wargrave said: 

"lombard?" 

"i agree, sir, absolutely." 

the judge nodded his head in a satisfied manner. he said: 

"now let us examine the evidence. to begin with, is there any reason for 
suspecting one particular person? mr. blore, you have, i think, something to say." 

blore was breathing hard. he said:

sted on her. it was the dispassionate stare of a 
man well used to weighing humanity in the balance. she thought: 

"he's just seeing me as a - as a specimen. and" - the thought came to her with 
real surprise - "he doesn't like me much!" 

in measured tones the judge was saying: 

"my dear young lady, do try and restrain your feelings. i am not accusing you." 
he bowed to miss brent. "i hope, miss brent, that you are not offended by my 
insistence that all of us are equally under suspicion?" 

emily brent was knitting. she did not look up. in a cold voice she said: 

"the idea that i should be accused of taking a fellow creature's life - not to speak 
of the lives of three fellow creatures - is, of course, quite absurd to any one who 
knows anything of my character. but i quite appreciate the fact that we are all 
strangers to one another and that in those circumstances, nobody can be 
exonerated without the fullest proof. there is, as i have said, a devil amongst us." 



the judge said:

brandy. there was then a question raised as to where the voice we had just heard 
had come from. we all went into the next room with the exception of miss brent 
who remained in this room - alone with the unconscious woman." 

a spot of colour came into emily brent's cheeks. she stopped knitting. she said: 

"this is outrageous!" 

the remorseless small voice went on. 

"when we returned to this room, you, miss brent, were bending over the woman 
on the sofa." 

emily brent said: 

"is common humanity a criminal offence?" 

mr. justice wargrave said:

the judge said: 

"some one could have left his or her bedroom - later." 



lombard objected: 

"but then rogers would have been up there." 

dr. armstrong stirred. 



"no," he said. "rogers went downstairs to clear up in the dining-room and pantry. 
any one could have gone up to the woman's bedroom then without being seen." 

emily brent said: 

"surely, doctor, the woman would have been fast asleep by then under the 
influence of the drug you had administered?" 

"in all likelihood, yes. but it is not a certainty. until you have prescribed for a 
patient more than once you cannot tell their reaction to different drugs. there is, 
sometimes, a considerable period before a sedative takes effect. it depends on the 
personal idiosyncrasy of the patient towards that particular drug."

"well, no." 

philip lombard said:

the judge said evenly: 



"a minute or two is a vague expression." 

he turned his head to the upright figure with the knitting lying on her lap. 

"miss brent?" 

emily brent said: 

"i took a walk with miss claythorne up to the top of the island. afterwards i sat 
on the terrace in the sun." 

the judge said: 

"i don't think i noticed you there." 



"no, i was round the corner of the house to the east. it was out of the wind 
there." 

"and you sat there till lunch time?" 

"yes." 

"miss claythorne?" 

vera answered readily and clearly.

rogers said: 

"yes, sir, thank you, sir." 

he went out, shutting the door behind him. 

inside the room, the pall of fear had fallen anew. 

again, surreptitiously, they watched each other. 



vi 

dinner came, was eaten, and cleared away. a simple meal, mostly out of tins. 

afterwards, in the living-room, the strain was almost too great to be borne. 

at nine o'clock, emily brent rose to her feet. 

she said: 

"i'm going to bed." 

vera said: 



"i'll go to bed too." 

the two women went up the stairs and lombard and blore went with them. 
standing at the top of the stairs, the two men watched the women go into their 
respective rooms and shut the doors. they heard the sound of two bolts being 
shot and the turning of two keys. 

blore said with a grin: 

"no need to tell 'em to lock their doors!" 

lombard said: 

"well, they're all right for the night, at any rate!"

there's no kettle on and the kitchen fire isn't even lit." 

blore swore under his breath. he said: 

"where the devil can he be? out on the island somewhere? wait till i get some 
clothes on. see if the others know anything." 

philip lombard nodded. he moved along the line of closed doors. 

he found armstrong up and nearly dressed. mr. justice wargrave, like blore, 
had to be roused from sleep. vera claythorne was dressed. emily brent's room 
was empty. 

the little party moved through the house. rogers' room, as philip lombard had 
already ascertained, was untenanted. the bed had been slept in, and his razor 
and sponge and soap were wet. 

lombard said: 

"he got up all right." 

vera said in a low voice which she tried to make firm and assured: 

"you don't think he's - hiding somewhere - waiting for us?" 

lombard said: 



"my dear girl, i'm prepared to think anything of any one! my advice is that we

armstrong said: 

"he must be out on the island somewhere." 

blore who had joined them, dressed, but still unshaved, said: 

"where's miss brent got to - that's another mystery?" 

but as they arrived in the hall, emily brent came in through the front door. she 
had on a mackintosh. she said: 

"the sea is as high as ever. i shouldn't think any boat could put out today." 

blore said: 

"have you been wandering about the island alone, miss brent? don't you realize 
that that's an exceedingly foolish thing to do?" 

emily brent said: 

"i assure you, mr. blore, that i kept an extremely sharp lookout." 

blore grunted. he said: 

"seen anything of rogers?" 

miss brent's eyebrows rose. 



"rogers? no, i haven't seen

"perfectly clear," said armstrong. "the murderer must have crept up behind him, 
swung the chopper once and brought it down on his head as he was bending 
over." 

blore was busy on the handle of the chopper and the flour sifter from the kitchen. 

mr. justice wargrave asked: 

"would it have needed great force, doctor?" 

armstrong said gravely: 

"a woman could have done it if that's what you mean." he gave a quick glance 
round. vera claythorne and emily brent had retired to the kitchen. "the girl 
could have done it easily - she's an athletic type. in appearance miss brent is 
fragile looking, but that type of woman has often a lot of wiry strength. and you 
must remember that any one who's mentally unhinged has a good deal of 
unsuspected strength." 

the judge nodded thoughtfully. 

blore rose from his knees with a sigh. he said: 

"no fingerprints. handle was wiped afterwards." 



a sound of laughter was heard - they turned sharply. vera claytho

as she went into the kitchen blore said:

armstrong said apologetically: 

"had to! we can't cope with hysteria on the top of everything else." 

philip lombard said: 

"she's not a hysterical type." 

armstrong agreed. 

"oh, no. good healthy sensible girl. just the sudden shock. it might happen to 
anybody." 

rogers had chopped a certain amount of firewood before he had been killed. they 
gathered it up and took it into the kitchen. vera and emily brent were busy. 
miss brent was raking out the stove. vera was cutting the rind off the bacon. 

emily brent said: 

"thank you. we'll be as quick as we can - say half an hour to three quarters. the 
kettle's got to boil."

ex-inspector blore said in a low hoarse voice to philip lombard:

arrived at last... 

they had praised her courage and her sang-froid... 

but not hugo. hugo had just - looked at her... 

god, how it hurt, even now, to think of hugo... 

where was he? what was he doing? was he engaged - married? 

emily brent said sharply: 

"vera, that bacon is burning." 

"oh, sorry, miss brent, so it is. how stupid of me." 

emily brent lifted out the last egg from the sizzling fat. 

vera, putting fresh pieces of bacon in the frying-pan, said curiously: 

"you're wonderfully calm, miss brent." 

emily brent said, pressing her lips together: 

"i was brought up to keep my head and never to make a fuss." 

vera thought mechanically: 

"repressed as a child... that accounts for a lot..." 



she said: 

"aren't you

 afraid?" 

she paused and then added: 

"or don't you mind dying?" 

dying! it was as though a sharp little gimlet had run into the solid congealed 
mass of emily brent's brain. dying? but she wasn't going to die! the others 
would die - yes - but not she, emily brent. this girl didn't understand! emily 
wasn't afraid naturally - none of the brents were afraid, all her people were 
service people. they faced death unflinchingly. they led upright lives just as she, 
emily brent, had led an upright life... she had never done anything to be 
ashamed of... and so, naturally, she wasn't going to die... 

"the lord is mindful of his own." "thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by 
night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day..." it was daylight now - there was no 
terror. "we shall none of us leave this island... who had said that? general 
macarthur, of course, whose cousin had married elsie macpherson. he hadn't

dreamt that she was outside pressing her face against the window and moaning, 
asking to be let in. but emily brent hadn't wanted to let her in. because, if she 
did, something terrible would happen... 

emily came to herself with a start. that girl was looking at her very strangely. 
she said in a brisk voice: 

"everything's ready, isn't it? we'll take the breakfast in."

breakfast was a curious meal. every one was very polite. 

"may i get you some more coffee, miss brent?" 

"miss claythorne, a slice of ham?" 

"another piece of bacon?" 

six people, all outwardly self-possessed and normal.

the meal was over. 

mr. justice wargrave cleared his throat. he said in a small authoritative voice: 

"it would be advisable, i think, if we met to discuss the situation. shall we say in 
half an hour's time in the drawing-room?" 

every one made a sound suggestive of agreement. 

vera began to pile plates together. 

she said: 

"i'll clear away and wash up." 

philip lombard said: 



"we'll bring the stuff out to the pantry for you." 

"thanks." 

emily brent, rising to her feet; sat down again. she said: 

"oh, dear." 

the judge said: 

"anything the matter, miss brent?" 

emily said apologetically: 

"i'm sorry. i'd like to help miss claythorne, but i don't know how it is. i feel just a 
little giddy." 

"giddy, eh?" dr. armstrong came towards her. "quite natural. delayed shock. i 
can give you something to -" 



"no!" 

the word burst from her lips like an exploding shell. 

it took every one aback. dr. armstrong flushed a deep red. 

there was

 no mistaking the fear and suspicion in her face. he said stiffly: 

"just as you please, miss brent." 

she said: 



"i don't wish to take anything - anything at all. i will just sit here quietly till the 
giddiness passes off." 

they finished clearing away the breakfast things. blore said: 

"i'm a domestic sort of man. i'll give you a hand, miss claythorne." 

vera said: "thank you." 

emily brent was left alone sitting in the dining-room. 

for a while she heard a faint murmur of voices from the pantry. 

the giddiness was passing. she felt drowsy now, as though she could easily go to 
sleep. 

there was a buzzing in her ears - or was it a real buzzing in the room? 

she thought: 

"it's like a bee - a bumblebee." 

presently she saw the bee. it was crawling up the window-pane. 

vera claythorne had talked about bees this morning. 

bees and honey... 

she liked honey. honey in the comb

she heard footsteps - soft dragging footsteps coming up behind her. the 
stumbling footsteps of the drowned girl... 

there was a wet dank smell in her nostrils... 

on the window-pane the bee was buzzing - buzzing... 

and then she felt the prick. 

the bee sting on the side of her neck... 



ii 

in the drawing-room they were waiting for emily brent. 

vera claythorne said: 



"shall i go and fetch her?" 

blore said quickly: 

"just a minute." 

vera sat down again. every one looked inquiringly at blore. 

he said: 

"look here, everybody, my opinion's this: we needn't look farther for the author of 
these deaths than the dining-room at this minute. i'd take my oath that woman's 
the one we're after!" 

armstrong said: 

"and the motive?" 

"religious mania. what do you say, doctor?" 

armstrong said: 

"it's perfectly possible. i've not

mr. justice wargrave said: 

"it is now five minutes to eleven. i think we should summon miss brent to join 
our conclave." 

blore said: 



"aren't you going to take any action?" 

the judge said: 

"i fail to see what action we can take. our suspicions are, at the moment, only 
suspicions. i will, however, ask dr. armstrong to observe miss brent's 
demeanour very carefully. let us now go into the dining-room." 

they found emily brent sitting in the chair in which they had left her. from 
behind they saw nothing amiss, except that she did not seem to hear their 
entrance into the room. 

and then they saw her face - suffused with blood, with blue lips and staring eyes. 

blore said: 

"my god, she's dead!" 



ill 

the small quiet voice of mr. justice wargrave said: 
"one more of us acquitted - too late!" 



armstrong was bent over the dead woman. he sniffed the lips, shook his head,

the a.c. nodded. 

maine said earnestly: 

"we thought of that, sir. we went into it. now, to begin with, we're not quite in 
the dark as to what happened on indian island. vera claythorne kept a diary, so 
did emily brent. old wargrave made some notes - dry legal cryptic stuff, but 
quite clear. and blore made notes too. all those accounts tally. the deaths 
occurred in this order: marston, mrs. rogers, macarthur, rogers, miss brent, 
wargrave. after his death vera claythorne's diary states that armstrong left the 
house in the night and that blore and lombard had gone after him. blore has 
one more entry in his notebook. just two words: 'armstrong disappeared.'
