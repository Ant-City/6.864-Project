"no, upon honor and by the faith of a gentleman, i bought it with the
contents of my own purse," answered he whom they designated by the name
porthos.

"yes; about in the same manner," said another musketeer, "that i bought
this new purse with what my mistress put into the old one."

"itâ€™s true, though," said porthos; "and the proof is that i paid twelve
pistoles for it."

the wonder was increased, though the doubt continued to exist.

"is it not true, aramis?" said porthos, turning toward another
musketeer.

this other musketeer formed a perfect contrast to his interrogator, who
had just designated him by the name of aramis. he was a stout man, of
about two- or three-and-twenty, with an open, ingenuous countenance, a
black, mild eye, and cheeks rosy and downy as an autumn peach. his
delicate mustache marked a perfectly straight line upon his upper lip;
he appeared to dread to lower his hands lest their veins should swell,
and he pinched the tips of

another musketeer, without addressing anyone in particular, but on the
contrary speaking to everybody.

"and what does he say?" asked porthos, in a self-sufficient tone.

"he relates that he met at brussels rochefort, the ame damnee of the
cardinal disguised as a capuchin, and that this cursed rochefort, thanks
to his disguise, had tricked monsieur de laigues, like a ninny as he
is."

"a ninny, indeed!" said porthos; "but is the matter certain?"

"i had it from aramis," replied the musketeer.

"indeed?"

"why, you knew it, porthos," said aramis. "i told you of it yesterday.
let us say no more about it."

"say no more about it? thatâ€™s your opinion!" replied porthos.

"say no more about it! peste! you come to your conclusions quickly.
what! the cardinal sets a spy upon a gentleman, has his letters stolen
from him by means of a traitor, a brigand, a rascal--has, with the help
of this spy and thanks to this correspondence, chalaisâ€™s throat cut,

gaping with wonder at the news, you come and tell us today, â€™let us say
no more about it.â€™"

"well, then, let us talk about it, since you desire it," replied aramis,
patiently.

"this rochefort," cried porthos, "if i were the esquire of poor chalais,
should pass a minute or two very uncomfortably with me."

"and you--you would pass rather a sad quarter-hour with the red duke,"
replied aramis.

"oh, the red duke! bravo! bravo! the red duke!" cried porthos, clapping
his hands and nodding his head. "the red duke is capital. iâ€™ll circulate
that saying, be assured, my dear fellow. who says this aramis is not a
wit? what a misfortune it is you did not follow y

"oh, itâ€™s only a temporary postponement," replied aramis; "i shall be
one someday. you very well know, porthos, that i continue to study
theology for that purpose."

"he will be one, as he says," cried porthos; "he will be one, sooner or
later."

"sooner," said aramis.

"he only waits for one thing to determine him to resume his cassock,
which hangs behind his uniform," said another musketeer.

"what is he waiting for?" asked another.

"only till the queen has given an heir to the crown of france."

"no jesting upon that subject, gentlemen," said porthos; "thank god the
queen is still of an age to give one!"

"they say that monsieur de buckingham is in france," replied aramis,
with a significant smile which gave to this sentence, apparently so
simple, a tole

rably scandalous meaning.

"aramis, my good friend, this time you are wrong," interrupted porthos.
"your wit is always leading you beyond bounds; if monsieur de treville
heard you, you would repent of speaking thus."

"are you going to give me a lesson, porthos?" cried aramis, from whose
usually mild eye a flash passed like lightning.

"my dear fellow, be a musketeer or an abbe. be one or the other, but not
both," replied porthos. "you know what athos told you the other day; you
eat at everybodyâ€™s mess. ah, donâ€™t be angry, i beg of you, that would be
useless; you know what is agreed upon between you, athos and me. you go

majesty? let whoever likes talk of the king and the cardinal, and how he
likes; but the queen is sacred, and if anyone speaks of her, let it be
respectfully."

"porthos, you are as vain as narcissus; i plainly tell you so," replied
aramis. "you know i hate moralizing, except when it is done by athos. as
to you, good sir, you wear too magnificent a baldric to be strong on
that head. i will be an abbe if it suits me. in the meanwhile i am a
musketeer; in that quality i say what i please, and at this moment it
pleases me to say that you weary me."

"aramis!"

"porthos!"

"gentlemen! gentlemen!" cried the surrounding group.

"monsieur de treville awaits monsieur dâ€™artagnan," cried a servant,
throwing open the door of the cabinet.

recalled to him at the same time his youth and his country--a double
remembrance which makes a man smile at all ages; but stepping toward the
antechamber and making a sign to dâ€™artagnan with his hand, as if to ask
his permission to finish with others before he began with him, he called
three times, with a louder voice at each time, so that he ran through
the intervening tones between the imperative accent and the angry
accent.

"athos! porthos! aramis!"

the two musketeers with whom we have already made acquaintance, and who
answered to the last of these three names, immediately quitted the group
of which they had formed a part, and advanced toward the cabinet, the
door of which closed after them as soon as they had entered. their
appearance, although it was not quite at ease, excited by its
carelessness, at once full of dignity and submission, the admiration of
dâ€™artagnan, who beheld in these two men demigods, and in their leader an

when the two musketeers had entered; when the door was closed behind
them; when the buzzing murmur of the antechamber, to which the summons
which had been made had doubtless furnished fresh food, had recommenced;
when m. de treville had three or four times paced in silence, and with a
frowning brow, the whole length of his cabinet, passing each time before
porthos and aramis, who were as upright and silent as if on parade--he
stopped all at once full in front of them, and covering them from head
to foot with an angry look, "do you know what the king said to me,"
cried he, "and that no longer ago than yesterday evening--do you know,
gentlemen?"

"no," replied the two musketeers, after a momentâ€™s silence, "no, sir, we
do not."

"but i hope that you will do us the honor to tell us," added aramis, in
his politest tone and with his most graceful bow.

"he told me that

at me with his tiger-catâ€™s eye, had made a riot in the rue ferou in a
cabaret, and that a party of his guards (i thought he was going to laugh
in my face) had been forced to arrest the rioters! morbleu! you must
know something about it. arrest musketeers! you were among them--you
were! donâ€™t deny it; you were recognized, and the cardinal named you.
but itâ€™s all my fault; yes, itâ€™s all my fault, because it is myself who
selects my men. you, aramis, why the devil did you ask me for a uniform
when you would have been so much better in a cassock? and you, porthos,
do you only wear such a fine golden baldric to suspend a sword of straw
from it? and athos--i donâ€™t see athos. where is he?"

"ill--"

"very ill, say you? and of what malady?"

"it is feared that it may be the smallpox, sir," replied porthos,
desirous of taking his turn in the conversation; "and what is serious is
that it will certainly spoil his face."

"the smallpox! thatâ€™s

at the crossways; and above all, i will not have occasion given for the
cardinalâ€™s guards, who are brave, quiet, skillful men who never put
themselves in a position to be arrested, and who, besides, never allow
themselves to be arrested, to laugh at you! i am sure of it--they would
prefer dying on the spot to being arrested or taking back a step. to
save yourselves, to scamper away, to flee--that is good for the kingâ€™s
musketeers!"

porthos and aramis trembled with rage. they could willingly have
strangled m. de treville, if, at the bottom of all this, they had not
felt it was the great love he bore them which made him speak thus. they
stamped upon the carpet with their feet; they bit their lips till the
blood came, and grasped the hilts of their swords with all their might.
all without had heard, as we have said, athos, porthos, and aramis
called, and had guessed, from m. de trevilleâ€™s tone of voice, that he

he way we escaped. as for athos, they believed him to be dead, and left
him very quiet on the field of battle, not thinking it worth the trouble
to carry him away. thatâ€™s the whole story. what the devil, captain, one
cannot win all oneâ€™s battles! the great pompey lost that of pharsalia;
and francis the first, who was, as i have heard say, as good as other
folks, nevertheless lost the battle of pavia."

"and i have the honor of assuring you that i killed one of them with his
own sword," said aramis; "for mine was broken at the first parry. killed
him, or poniarded him, sir, as is most agreeable to you."

"i did not know that," replied m. de treville, in a somewhat softened
tone. "the cardinal exaggerated, as i perceive."

"but pray, sir," continued aramis, who, seeing his captain become
appeased, ventured to risk a prayer, "do not say that athos is wounded.
he would be in despair if that should come to the ears of the king; and
as the wound is very serious, seeing that after crossing the

crowded round the wounded man. but all this eager attention might have
been useless if the doctor so loudly called for had not chanced to be in
the hotel. he pushed through the crowd, approached athos, still
insensible, and as all this noise and commotion inconvenienced him
greatly, he required, as the first and most urgent thing, that the
musketeer should be carried into an adjoining chamber. immediately m. de
treville opened and pointed the way to porthos and aramis, who bore
their comrade in their arms. behind this group walked the surgeon; and
behind the surgeon the door closed.

the cabinet of m. de treville, generally held so sacred, became in an
instant the annex of the antechamber. everyone spoke, harangued, and
vociferated, swearing, cursing, and consigning the cardinal and his
guards to all the devils.

an instant after, porthos and aramis re-entered, the surgeon and m. de
treville alone remaining with the wounded.

at length, m. de treville himsel

become crimson with passion, and rush from the cabinet crying, "sâ€™blood,
he shall not escape me this time!"

"and who?" asked m. de treville.

"he, my thief!" replied dâ€™artagnan. "ah, the traitor!" and he
disappeared.

"the devil take the madman!" murmured m. de treville, "unless," added
he, "this is a cunning mode of escaping, seeing that he had failed in
his purpose!"




4 the shoulder of athos, the baldric of porthos and the handkerchief of
aramis


dâ€™artagnan, in a state of fury, crossed the antechamber at three bounds,
and was darting toward the stairs, which he reckoned upon descending
four at a time, when, in his heedless course, he ran head foremost
against a musketeer who was coming out of one of m. de trevilleâ€™s
private rooms, and striking his shoulder violently, made him utter a
cry, or rather a howl.

"excuse me," said dâ€™artagnan, endeavoring to resume his course, "excuse
me, but i am in a hurry."

scarcely had he descende

ursed baldric--in ambiguous words,
it is true, but rather drolly ambiguous. ah, cursed gascon that i am, i
get from one hobble into another. friend dâ€™artagnan," continued he,
speaking to himself with all the amenity that he thought due himself,
"if you escape, of which there is not much chance, i would advise you to
practice perfect politeness for the future. you must henceforth be
admired and quoted as a model of it. to be obliging and polite does not
necessarily make a man a coward. look at aramis, now; aramis is mildness
and grace personified. well, did anybody ever dream of calling aramis a
coward? no, certainly not, and from this moment i will endeavor to model
myself after him. ah! thatâ€™s strange! here he is!"

dâ€™artagnan, walking and soliloquizing, had arrived within a few steps of
the hotel dâ€™arguillon and in front of that hotel perceived aramis,
chatting gaily with three gentlemen; but as he had not forgotten that it
was in presence of this young man that m. de treville had 
 
 ___________________________
 
all four, besides, immediately
broke off their conversation.

dâ€™artagnan was not so dull as not to perceive that he was one too many;
but he was not sufficiently broken into the fashions of the gay world to
know how to extricate himself gallantly from a false position, like that
of a man who begins to mingle with people he is scarcely acquainted with
and in a conversation that does not concern him. he was seeking in his
mind, then, for the least awkward means of retreat, when he remarked
that aramis had let his handkerchief fall, and by mistake, no doubt, had
placed his foot upon it. this appeared to be a favorable opportunity to
repair his intrusion. he stooped, and with the most gracious air he
could assume, drew the handkerchief from under the foot of the musketeer
in spite of the efforts the latter made to detain it, and holding it out
to him, said, "i believe, monsieur, that this is a handkerchief you
would be sorry to lose?"

the handkerchief was indeed richly embroidered, and had a 
 
 ___________________________
 
coronet and
arms at one of its corners. aramis blushed excessively, and snatched
rather than took the handkerchief from the hand of the gascon.

"ah, ah!" cried one of the guards, "will you persist in saying, most
discreet aramis, that you are not on good terms with madame de
bois-tracy, when that gracious lady has the kindness to lend you one of
her handkerchiefs?"

aramis darted at dâ€™artagnan one of those looks which inform a man that
he has acquired a mortal enemy. then, resuming his mild air, "you are
deceived, gentlemen," said he, "this handkerchief is not mine, and i
cannot fancy why monsieur has taken it into his head to offer it to me
rather than to one of you; and as a proof of what i say, here is mine in
my pocket."

so saying, he pulled out his own handkerchief, likewise a very elegant
handkerchief, and of fine cambric--though cambric was dear at the

 
 ___________________________
 
period--but a handkerchief without embroidery and without arms, only
ornamented with a single cipher, that of its proprietor.

this time dâ€™artagnan was not hasty. he perceived his mistake; but the
friends of aramis were not at all convinced by his denial, and one of
them addressed the young musketeer with affected seriousness. "if it
were as you pretend it is," said he, "i should be forced, my dear
aramis, to reclaim it myself; for, as you very well know, bois-tracy is
an intimate friend of mine, and i cannot allow the property of his wife
to be sported as a trophy."

"you make the demand badly," replied aramis; "and while acknowledging
the justice of your reclamation, i refuse it on account of the form."

"the fact is," hazarded dâ€™artagnan, timidly, "i did not see the
handkerchief fall from the pocket of monsieur aramis. he had his foot
upon it, that is all; and i thought from having his foot
 
 ___________________________
 
 upon it the
handkerchief was his."

"and you were deceived, my dear sir," replied aramis, coldly, very
little sensible to the reparation. then turning toward that one of the
guards who had declared himself the friend of bois-tracy, "besides,"
continued he, "i have reflected, my dear intimate of bois-tracy, that i
am not less tenderly his friend than you can possibly be; so that
decidedly this handkerchief is as likely to have fallen from your pocket
as mine."

"no, upon my honor!" cried his majestyâ€™s guardsman.

"you are about to swear upon your honor and i upon my word, and then
 
 ___________________________
 
 it
will be pretty evident that one of us will have lied. now, here,
montaran, we will do better than that--let each take a half."

"of the handkerchief?"

"yes."

"perfectly just," cried the other two guardsmen, "the judgment of king
solomon! aramis, you certainly are full of wisdom!"

the young men burst into a laugh, and as may be supposed, the affair had
no other sequel. in a moment or two the conversation ceased, and the
three guardsmen and the musketeer, after having cordially shaken hands,
separated, the guardsmen going one way and aramis another.

"now is my time to make peace with this gallant man," said dâ€™artagnan to
himself, having stood on one side during the whole of the latter part of
the conversation; and with this good fee

ling drawing near to aramis, who
was departing without paying any attention to him, "monsieur," said he,
"you will excuse me, i hope."

"ah, monsieur," interrupted aramis, "permit me to observe to you that
you have not acted in this affair as a gallant man ought."

"what, monsieur!" cried dâ€™artagnan, "and do you suppose--"

"i suppose, monsieur, that you are not a fool, and that you knew very
well, although coming from gascony, that people do not tread upon
handkerchiefs without a reason. what the devil! paris is not paved with
cambric!"

"monsieur, you act wrongly in endeavoring to mortify me," said
dâ€™artagnan, in whom the natural quarrelsome spirit began t
 
 ___________________________
 
o speak more
loudly than his pacific resolutions. "i am from gascony, it is true; and
since you know it, there is no occasion to tell you that gascons are not
very patient, so that when they have begged to be excused once, were it
even for a folly, they are convinced that they have done already at
least as much again as they ought to have done."

"monsieur, what i say to you about the matter," said aramis, "is not for
the sake of seeking a quarrel. thank god, i am not a bravo! and being a
musketeer but for a time, i only fight when i am forced to do so, and
always with great repugnance; but this time the affair is serious, for
here is a lady compromised by you."

"by us, you mean!" cried dâ€™artagnan.

"why did you so maladroitly restore me the handkerchief?"

"why did you so awkwardly let it fall?"

"i have said, monsieur, and i repeat, that the handkerchief did not fall
from my pocket."

"and

shoulders so correctly. i wish to kill you, be at rest as to that, but
to kill you quietly in a snug, remote place, where you will not be able
to boast of your death to anybody."

"i agree, monsieur; but do not be too confident. take your handkerchief;
whether it belongs to you or another, you may perhaps stand in need of
it."

"monsieur is a gascon?" asked aramis.

"yes. monsieur does not postpone an interview through prudence?"

"prudence, monsieur, is a virtue sufficiently useless to musketeers, i
know, but indispensable to churchmen; and as i am only a musketeer
provisionally, i hold it good to be prudent. at two oâ€™clock i shall have
the honor of expecting you at the hotel of monsieur de treville. there i
will indicate to you the best place and time."

the two young men bowed and separated, aramis ascending the street which
led to the luxembourg, w
 
 ___________________________
 
 place. he
reflected upon the different characters of those with whom he was going
to fight, and began to view his situation more clearly. he hoped, by
means of loyal excuses, to make a friend of athos, whose lordly air and
austere bearing pleased him much. he flattered himself he should be able
to frighten porthos with the adventure of the baldric, which he might,
if not killed upon the spot, relate to everybody a recital which, well
managed, would cover porthos with ridicule. as to the astute aramis, he
did not entertain much dread of him; and supposing he should be able to
get so far, he determined to dispatch him in good style or at least, by
hitting him in the face, as caesar recommended his soldiers do to those
of pompey, to damage forever the beauty of which he was so proud.

in addition to this, dâ€™artagnan possessed that invincible stock of
resolution which the counsels of his father had implanted in his heart:
"endure nothing from anyone but the king, the cardinal, and monsieur de
 
 ___________________________
 
ill each other, i shall hereafter have much pleasure in your
conversation. we will wait for these gentlemen, so please you; i have
plenty of time, and it will be more correct. ah, here is one of them, i
believe."

in fact, at the end of the rue vaugirard the gigantic porthos appeared.

"what!" cried dâ€™artagnan, "is your first witness monsieur porthos?"

"yes, that disturbs you?"

"by no means."

"and here is the second."

dâ€™artagnan turned in the direction pointed to by athos, and perceived
aramis.

"what!" cried he, in an accent of greater astonishment than before,
"your second witness is monsieur aramis?"

"doubtless! are you not aware that we are never seen one without the
others, and that we are called among the musketeers and the guards, at
court and in the city, athos, porthos, and aramis, or the three
inseparables? and yet, as you come from dax or pau--"

"from tarbes," said dâ€™artagnan.

"it is probable you are ignorant of this little fact," said athos.

"my faith!" replied dâ€™
 
 ___________________________
 
and then
turning toward dâ€™artagnan, stood quite astonished.

let us say in passing that he had changed his baldric and relinquished
his cloak.

"ah, ah!" said he, "what does this mean?"

"this is the gentleman i am going to fight with," said athos, pointing
to dâ€™artagnan with his hand and saluting him with the same gesture.

"why, it is with him i am also going to fight," said porthos.

"but not before one oâ€™clock," replied dâ€™artagnan.

"and i also am to fight with this gentleman," said aramis, coming in his
turn onto the place.

"but not until two oâ€™clock," said dâ€™artagnan, with the same calmness.

"but what are you going to fight about, athos?" asked aramis.

"faith! i donâ€™t very well know. he hurt my shoulder. and you, porthos?"

"faith! i am going to fight--because i am going to fight," answered
porthos, reddening.

athos, whose keen eye lost nothing, perceived a faintly sly smile pass
over the lips of the young gascon as he replied, "we had a short
discussion upon dress."

 
 ___________________________
 

"and you, aramis?" asked athos.

"oh, ours is a theological quarrel," replied aramis, making a sign to
dâ€™artagnan to keep secret the cause of their duel.

athos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of dâ€™artagnan.

"indeed?" said athos.

"yes; a passage of st. augustine, upon which we could not agree," said
the gascon.

"decidedly, this is a clever fellow," murmured athos.

"and now you are assembled, gentlemen," said dâ€™artagnan, "permit me to
offer you my apologies."

at this word apologies, a cloud passed over the brow of athos, a haughty
smile curled the lip of porthos
 
 ___________________________
 
, and a negative sign was the reply of
aramis.

"you do not understand me, gentlemen," said dâ€™artagnan, throwing up his
head, the sharp and bold lines of which were at the moment gilded by a
bright ray of the sun. "i asked to be excused in case i should not be
able to discharge my debt to all three; for monsieur athos has the right
to kill me first, which must much diminish the face-value of your bill,
monsieur porthos, and render yours almost null, monsieur aramis. and
now, gentlemen, i repeat, excuse me, but on that account only, and--on
guard!"

at these words, with the most gallant air possible, dâ€™artagnan drew his
sword.

the blood had mounted to the head of dâ€™artagnan, and at that moment he
would have drawn his sword against all the musketeers in the kingdom as
willingly as he now did against athos, porthos, and aramis.

it was a quarter past midday. the sun was in its zenith, and the spot
chosen for the scene of the duel was exposed to its full

ot like to annoy monsieur with the sight of blood
which he has not drawn from me himself."

"that is true, monsieur," replied dâ€™artagnan, "and whether drawn by
myself or another, i assure you i shall always view with regret the
blood of so brave a gentleman. i will therefore fight in my doublet,
like yourself."

"come, come, enough of such compliments!" cried porthos. "remember, we
are waiting for our turns."

"speak for yourself when you are inclined to utter such incongruities,"
interrupted aramis. "for my part, i think what they say is very well
said, and quite worthy of two gentlemen."

"when you please, monsieur," said athos, putting himself on guard.

"i waited your orders," said dâ€™artagnan, crossing swords.

but scarcely had the two rapiers clashed, when a company of the guards
of his eminence, commanded by m. de jussac, turned the corner of the
convent.

"the cardinalâ€™s guards!" cried aramis and porthos at the same time.
"sheathe your swords, gentlemen, sheathe your swords!"

b
 
 ___________________________
 
"you are very generous, gentlemen of the guards," said athos, full of
rancor, for jussac was one of the aggressors of the preceding day. "if
we were to see you fighting, i can assure you that we would make no
effort to prevent you. leave us alone, then, and you will enjoy a little
amusement without cost to yourselves."

"gentlemen," said jussac, "it is with great regret that i pronounce the
thing impossible. duty before everything. sheathe, then, if you please,
and follow us."

"monsieur," said aramis, parodying jussac, "it would afford us great
pleasure to obey your polite invitation if it depended upon ourselves;
but unfortunately the thing is impossible--monsieur de treville has
forbidden it. pass on your way, then; it is the best thing to do."

this raillery exasperated jussac. "we will charge upon you, then," said
he, "if you disobey."

"there are five of them," said athos, half aloud, "and we are but three;
we shall be beaten again, and must die on the spot, for, on my part, i
declare 
 
 ___________________________
 
i will never appear again before the captain as a conquered
man."

athos, porthos, and aramis instantly drew near one another, while jussac
drew up his soldiers.

this short interval was sufficient to determine dâ€™artagnan on the part
he was to take. it was one of those events which decide the life of a
man; it was a choice between the king and the cardinal--the choice made,
it must be persisted in. to fight, that was to disobey the law, that was
to risk his head, that was to make at one blow an enemy of a minister
more powerful than the king himself. all this the young man perceived,

t i have
the spirit. my heart is that of a musketeer; i feel it, monsieur, and
that impels me on."

"withdraw, young man," cried jussac, who doubtless, by his gestures and
the expression of his countenance, had guessed dâ€™artagnanâ€™s design. "you
may retire; we consent to that. save your skin; begone quickly."

dâ€™artagnan did not budge.

"decidedly, you are a brave fellow," said athos, pressing the young
manâ€™s hand.

"come, come, choose your part," replied jussac.

"well," said porthos to aramis, "we must do something."

"monsieur is full of generosity," said athos.

but all three reflected upon the youth of dâ€™artagnan, and dreaded his
inexperience.

"we should only be three, one of whom is wounded, with the addition of a
boy," resumed athos; "and yet it will not be the less said we were four
men."

"yes, but to yield!" said porthos.

"that is difficult," replied athos.

dâ€™artagnan comprehended their irresolution.

"try me, gentlemen," said he, "and i swear to you by my honor that

i
will not go hence if we are conquered."

"what is your name, my brave fellow?" said athos.

"dâ€™artagnan, monsieur."

"well, then, athos, porthos, aramis, and dâ€™artagnan, forward!" cried
athos.

"come, gentlemen, have you decided?" cried jussac for the third time.

"it is done, gentlemen," said athos.

"and what is your choice?" asked jussac.

"we are about to have the honor of charging you," replied aramis,
lifting his hat with one hand and drawing his sword with the other.

"ah! you resist, do you?" cried jussac.

"sâ€™blood; does that astonish you?"

and the nine combatants rushed upon each other with a fury which however
did not exclude a certain degree of method.

athos fixed upon a certain cahusac, a favorite of the cardinalâ€™s.
porthos had bicarat, and aramis found himself opposed to two
adversaries. as to dâ€™artagnan, he sprang toward jussac himself.

the heart of the young gascon beat a

ered a boy, he became warm and
began to make mistakes. dâ€™artagnan, who though wanting in practice had a
sound theory, redoubled his agility. jussac, anxious to put an end to
this, springing forward, aimed a terrible thrust at his adversary, but
the latter parried it; and while jussac was recovering himself, glided
like a serpent beneath his blade, and passed his sword through his body.
jussac fell like a dead mass.

dâ€™artagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of
battle.

aramis had killed one of his adversaries, but the other pressed him
warmly. nevertheless, aramis was in a good situation, and able to defend
himself.

bicarat and porthos had just made counterhits. porthos had received a
thrust through his arm, and bicarat one through his thigh. but neither
of these two wounds was serious, and they only fought more earnestly.

athos, wounded anew by cahusac, became evidently paler, but did not give
way a foot. he only changed his sword hand, and fought with his left

again. disarm him only--make sure of his sword. thatâ€™s it! very well
done!"

the exclamation was drawn from athos by seeing the sword of cahusac fly
twenty paces from him. dâ€™artagnan and cahusac sprang forward at the same
instant, the one to recover, the other to obtain, the sword; but
dâ€™artagnan, being the more active, reached it first and placed his foot
upon it.

cahusac immediately ran to the guardsman whom aramis had killed, seized
his rapier, and returned toward dâ€™artagnan; but on his way he met athos,
who during his relief which dâ€™artagnan had procured him had recovered
his breath, and who, for fear that dâ€™artagnan would kill his enemy,
wished to resume the fight.

dâ€™artagnan perceived that it would be disobliging athos not to leave him
alone; and in a few minutes cahusac fell, with a sword thrust through
his throat.

at the same instant aramis placed his sword point on the breast of his
falle

to ask for mercy.

there only then remained porthos and bicarat. porthos made a thousand
flourishes, asking bicarat what oâ€™clock it could be, and offering him
his compliments upon his brotherâ€™s having just obtained a company in the
regiment of navarre; but, jest as he might, he gained nothing. bicarat
was one of those iron men who never fell dead.

nevertheless, it was necessary to finish. the watch might come up and
take all the combatants, wounded or not, royalists or cardinalists.
athos, aramis, and dâ€™artagnan surrounded bicarat, and required him to
surrender. though alone against all and with a wound in his thigh,
bicarat wished to hold out; but jussac, who had risen upon his elbow,
cried out to him to yield. bicarat was a gascon, as dâ€™artagnan was; he
turned a deaf ear, and contented himself with laughing, and between two
parries finding time to point to a spot of earth with his sword, "here,"
cried he, parodying a verse of the bible, "here will bicarat die; for i
only am left,

t. "as you are
my commander, it is my duty to obey." and springing backward, he broke
his sword across his knee to avoid the necessity of surrendering it,
threw the pieces over the convent wall, and crossed him arms, whistling
a cardinalist air.

bravery is always respected, even in an enemy. the musketeers saluted
bicarat with their swords, and returned them to their sheaths.
dâ€™artagnan did the same. then, assisted by bicarat, the only one left
standing, they bore jussac, cahusac, and one of aramisâ€™s adversaries who
was only wounded, under the porch of the convent. the fourth, as we have
said, was dead. they then rang the bell, and carrying away four swords
out of five, they took their road, intoxicated with joy, toward the
hotel of m. de treville.

they walked arm in arm, occupying the whole width of the street and
taking in every musketeer they met, so that in the end it became a
triumphal march. the heart of dâ€™artagnan swam in delirium; he marched
between athos and porthos, pressin

"yes, sire, as they always do."

"and how did the thing happen? let us see, for you know, my dear
captain, a judge must hear both sides."

"good lord! in the most simple and natural manner possible. three of my
best soldiers, whom your majesty knows by name, and whose devotedness
you have more than once appreciated, and who have, i dare affirm to the
king, his service much at heart--three of my best soldiers, i say,
athos, porthos, and aramis, had made a party of pleasure with a young
fellow from gascony, whom i had introduced to them the same morning. the
party was to take place at st. germain, i believe, and they had
appointed to meet at the carmes-deschaux, when they were disturbed by de
jussac, cahusac, bicarat, and two other guardsmen, who certainly did not
go there in such a numerous company without some ill intention against
the edicts."

"ah, ah! you incline me to think so," said the king. "there is no doubt

of him.

that evening the three musketeers were informed of the honor accorded
them. as they had long been acquainted with the king, they were not much
excited; but dâ€™artagnan, with his gascon imagination, saw in it his
future fortune, and passed the night in golden dreams. by eight oâ€™clock
in the morning he was at the apartment of athos.

dâ€™artagnan found the musketeer dressed and ready to go out. as the hour
to wait upon the king was not till twelve, he had made a party with
porthos and aramis to play a game at tennis in a tennis court situated
near the stables of the luxembourg. athos invited dâ€™artagnan to follow
them; and although ignorant of the game, which he had never played, he
accepted, not knowing what to do with his time from nine oâ€™clock in the
morning, as it then scarcely was, till twelve.

the two musketeers were already there, and were playing together. athos,
who was very expert in all bodily exercises, passed with dâ€™artagnan to
the opposite side and challenged th

 was too ignorant of the game to play it
regularly they only continued giving balls to one another without
counting. but one of these balls, launched by porthosâ€™ herculean hand,
passed so close to dâ€™artagnanâ€™s face that he thought that if, instead of
passing near, it had hit him, his audience would have been probably
lost, as it would have been impossible for him to present himself before
the king. now, as upon this audience, in his gascon imagination,
depended his future life, he saluted aramis and porthos politely,
declaring that he would not resume the game until he should be prepared
to play with them on more equal terms, and went and took his place near
the cord and in the gallery.

unfortunately for dâ€™artagnan, among the spectators was one of his
eminenceâ€™s guardsmen, who, still irritated by the defeat of his
companions, which had happened only the day before, had promised himself
to seize the first opportunity of avenging it. he believed this
opportunity was now come and add

ot hurry yourself, monsieur, lest it be observed that we go out
together. you must be aware that for our undertaking, company would be
in the way."

"thatâ€™s true," said the guardsman, astonished that his name had not
produced more effect upon the young man.

indeed, the name of bernajoux was known to all the world, dâ€™artagnan
alone excepted, perhaps; for it was one of those which figured most
frequently in the daily brawls which all the edicts of the cardinal
could not repress.

porthos and aramis were so engaged with their game, and athos was
watching them with so much attention, that they did not even perceive
their young companion go out, who, as he had told the guardsman of his
eminence, stopped outside the door. an instant after, the guardsman
descended in his turn. as dâ€™artagnan had no time to lose, on account of
the audience of the king, which was fixed for midday, he cast his eyes
around, and seeing that the street was empty, said to his adversary, "my
faith! it is fortunate fo

le, in whose service he had a
relative, dâ€™artagnan was ignorant of the seriousness of the last wound
his adversary had received, and pressing him warmly, without doubt would
soon have completed his work with a third blow, when the noise which
arose from the street being heard in the tennis court, two of the
friends of the guardsman, who had seen him go out after exchanging some
words with dâ€™artagnan, rushed, sword in hand, from the court, and fell
upon the conqueror. but athos, porthos, and aramis quickly appeared in
their turn, and the moment the two guardsmen attacked their young
companion, drove them back. bernajoux now fell, and as the guardsmen
were only two against four, they began to cry, "to the rescue! the hotel
de la tremouille!" at these cries, all who were in the hotel rushed out
and fell upon the four companions, who on their side cried aloud, "to
the rescue, musketeers!"

this cry was generally heeded; for the musketeers were known to be
enemies of the cardinal, and were be

loved on account of the hatred they
bore to his eminence. thus the soldiers of other companies than those
which belonged to the red duke, as aramis had called him, often took
part with the kingâ€™s musketeers in these quarrels. of three guardsmen of
the company of m. dessessart who were passing, two came to the
assistance of the four companions, while the other ran toward the hotel
of m. de treville, crying, "to the rescue, musketeers! to the rescue!"
as usual, this hotel was full of soldiers of this company, who hastened
to the succor of their comrades. the melee became general, but strength
was on the side of the musketeers. the cardinal

. de la tremouille, returned to his hotel,
and immediately sent word to the four friends that he awaited their
company at dinner.

m de treville entertained good company, wholly anticardinalist, though.
it may easily be understood, therefore, that the conversation during the
whole of dinner turned upon the two checks that his eminenceâ€™s guardsmen
had received. now, as dâ€™artagnan had been the hero of these two fights,
it was upon him that all the felicitations fell, which athos, porthos,
and aramis abandoned to him, not only as good comrades, but as men who
had so often had their turn that they could very well afford him his.

toward six oâ€™clock m. de treville announced that it was time to go to
the louvre; but as the hour of audience granted by his majesty was past,
instead of claiming the entree by the back stairs, he placed himself
with the four young men in the antechamber. the king had not yet
returned from hunting. our young men had been waiting about half an
hour, amid a crowd of

hip in his hand. at the
first glance, dâ€™artagnan judged that the mind of the king was stormy.

this disposition, visible as it was in his majesty, did not prevent the
courtiers from ranging themselves along his pathway. in royal
antechambers it is worth more to be viewed with an angry eye than not to
be seen at all. the three musketeers therefore did not hesitate to make
a step forward. dâ€™artagnan on the contrary remained concealed behind
them; but although the king knew athos, porthos, and aramis personally,
he passed before them without speaking or looking--indeed, as if he had
never seen them before. as for m. de treville, when the eyes of the king
fell upon him, he sustained the look with so much firmness that it was
the king who dropped his eyes; after which his majesty, grumbling,
entered his apartment.

"matters go but badly," said athos, smiling; "and we shall not be made
chevaliers of the order this time."

"wait here ten minutes," said m. de treville; "and if at the expiration

o set fire to paris, without your
saying a word? but yet," continued the king, "undoubtedly my haste
accuses you wrongfully; without doubt the rioters are in prison, and you
come to tell me justice is done."

"sire," replied m. de treville, calmly, "on the contrary, i come to
demand it of you."

"and against whom?" cried the king.

"against calumniators," said m. de treville.

"ah! this is something new," replied the king. "will you tell me that
your three damned musketeers, athos, porthos, and aramis, and your
youngster from bearn, have not fallen, like so many furies, upon poor
bernajoux, and have not maltreated him in such a fashion that probably
by this time he is dead? will you tell me that they did not lay siege to
the hotel of the duc de la tremouille, and that they did not endeavor to
burn it?--which would not, perhaps, have been a great misfortune in time
of war, seeing that it is nothing but a nest of huguenots, but which is,
in time of peace, a frightful example. tell me, now, can

able.
this did not prevent the king from being as complacent to him as
possible whenever he met him, or from asking in the kindest tone, "well,
monsieur cardinal, how fares it with that poor jussac and that poor
bernajoux of yours?"




7 the interior* of the musketeers


when dâ€™artagnan was out of the louvre, and consulted his friends upon
the use he had best make of his share of the forty pistoles, athos
advised him to order a good repast at the pomme-de-pin, porthos to
engage a lackey, and aramis to provide himself with a suitable mistress.

_*domestic affairs, housekeeping_

the repast was carried into effect that very day, and the lackey waited
at table. the repast had been ordered by athos, and the lackey furnished
by porthos. he was a picard, whom the glorious musketeer had picked up
on the bridge tournelle, making rings and plashing in the water.

porthos pretended that this occupation was proof of a reflective and
contemplative organization, and he had brought him away without any

an antechamber and a bedroom. planchet
slept in the antechamber upon a coverlet taken from the bed of
dâ€™artagnan, and which dâ€™artagnan from that time made shift to do
without.

athos, on his part, had a valet whom he had trained in his service in a
thoroughly peculiar fashion, and who was named grimaud. he was very
taciturn, this worthy signor. be it understood we are speaking of athos.
during the five or six years that he had lived in the strictest intimacy
with his companions, porthos and aramis, they could remember having
often seen him smile, but had never heard him laugh. his words were
brief and expressive, conveying all that was meant, and no more; no
embellishments, no embroidery, no arabesques. his conversation was a
matter of fact, without a single romance.

although athos was scarcely thirty years old, and was of great personal
beauty and intelligence of mind, no one knew whether he had ever had a
mistress. he never spoke of women. he certainly did not prevent others
from spea

ay to himself, consecrated to an employment which would provide
for his other wants. porthos agreed to the bargain; the thing suited him
wonderfully well. he had doublets cut out of his old clothes and
cast-off cloaks for mousqueton, and thanks to a very intelligent tailor,
who made his clothes look as good as new by turning them, and whose wife
was suspected of wishing to make porthos descend from his aristocratic
habits, mousqueton made a very good figure when attending on his master.

as for aramis, of whom we believe we have sufficiently explained the
character--a character which, like that of his companions, we shall be
able to follow in its development--his lackey was called bazin. thanks
to the hopes which his master entertained of someday entering into
orders, he was always clothed in black, as became the servant of a
churchman. he was a berrichon, thirty-five or forty years old, mild,
peaceable, sleek, employing the leisure his master left him in the
perusal of pious works, providin

 no doubt.

porthos lived in an apartment, large in size and of very sumptuous
appearance, in the rue du vieux-colombier. every time he passed with a
friend before his windows, at one of which mousqueton was sure to be
placed in full livery, porthos raised his head and his hand, and said,
"that is my abode!" but he was never to be found at home; he never
invited anybody to go up with him, and no one could form an idea of what
his sumptuous apartment contained in the shape of real riches.

as to aramis, he dwelt in a little lodging composed of a boudoir, an
eating room, and a bedroom, which room, situated, as the others were, on
the ground floor, looked out upon a little fresh green garden, shady and
impenetrable to the eyes of his neighbors.

with regard to dâ€™artagnan, we know how he was lodged, and we have
already made acquaintance with his lackey, master planchet.

dâ€™artagnan, who was by nature very curious--as people generally are who
possess the genius of intrigue--did all he could t

o make out who athos,
porthos, and aramis really were (for under these pseudonyms each of
these young men concealed his family name)--athos in particular, who, a
league away, savored of nobility. he addressed himself then to porthos
to gain information respecting athos and aramis, and to aramis in order
to learn something of porthos.

unfortunately porthos knew nothing of the life of his silent companion
but what revealed itself. it was said athos had met with great crosses
in love, and that a frightful treachery had forever poisoned the life of
this gallant man. what could this treachery be? all the world was
ignorant of it.

as to porthos, except his real name (as was the case with those of his
two comrades), his life was very easily known. vain and indiscreet, it
was as easy to see

 through him as through a crystal. the only thing to
mislead the investigator would have been belief in all the good things
he said of himself.

with respect to aramis, though having the air of having nothing secret
about him, he was a young fellow made up of mysteries, answering little
to questions put to him about others, and having learned from him the
report which prevailed concerning the success of the musketeer with a
princess, wished to gain a little insight into the amorous adventures of
his interlocutor. "and you, my dear companion," said he, "you speak of
the baronesses, countesses, and princesses of others?"

"pardieu! i spoke of them because porth
 
 ___________________________
 
talked of them himself,
because he had paraded all these fine things before me. but be assured,
my dear monsieur dâ€™artagnan, that if i had obtained them from any other
source, or if they had been confided to me, there exists no confessor
more discreet than myself."

"oh, i donâ€™t doubt that," replied dâ€™artagnan; "but it seems to me that
you are tolerably familiar with coats of arms--a certain embroidered
handkerchief, for instance, to which i owe the honor of your
acquaintance?"

this time aramis was not angry, but assumed the most modest air and
replied in a friendly tone, "my dear friend, do not forget that i wish
to belong to the church, and that i avoid all mundane opportunities. the
handkerchief you saw had not been given to me, but it had been forgotten
and left at my house by one of my friends. i was obliged to pick it up
in order not to compromise him and the lady he loves. as for myself, i
neither have, nor desire to have, a mistress, following in that respect

 a musketeer!"

"a musketeer for a time, my friend, as the cardinal says, a musketeer
against my will, but a churchman at heart, believe me. athos and porthos
dragged me into this to occupy me. i had, at the moment of being
ordained, a little difficulty with--but that would not interest you, and
i am taking up your valuable time."

"not at all; it interests me very much," cried dâ€™artagnan; "and at this
moment i have absolutely nothing to do."

"yes, but i have my breviary to repeat," answered aramis; "then some
verses to compose, which madame dâ€™aiguillon begged of me. then i must go
to the rue st. honore in order to purchase some rouge for madame de
chevreuse. so you see, my dear friend, that if you are not in a hurry, i
am very much in a hurry."

aramis held out his hand in a cordial manner to his young companion, and
took leave of him.

notwithstanding all the pains he took, dâ€™artagnan was unable to learn
any more concerning his three new-made friends. he formed, therefore,
the resol

ution of believing for the present all that was said of their
past, hoping for more certain and extended revelations in the future. in
the meanwhile, he looked upon athos as an achilles, porthos as an ajax,
and aramis as a joseph.

as to the rest, the life of the four young friends was joyous enough.
athos played, and that as a rule unfortunately. nevertheless, he never
borrowed a sou of his companions, although his purse was ever at their
service; and when he had played upon honor, he always awakened his
creditor by six oâ€™clock the next morning to pay the debt of the
preceding evening.

porthos had his fits. on the days when he won he was insolent and
ostentatious; if he lost, he disappeared completely fo

r several days,
after which he reappeared with a pale face and thinner person, but with
money in his purse.

as to aramis, he never played. he was the worst musketeer and the most
unconvivial companion imaginable. he had always something or other to
do. sometimes in the midst of dinner, when everyone, under the
attraction of wine and in the warmth of conversation, believed they had
two or three hours longer to enjoy themselves at table, aramis looked at
his watch, arose with a bland smile, and took leave of the company, to
go, as he said, to consult a casuist with whom he had an appointment. at
other times he would return home to write a treatise, and requested his
friends not to disturb him.

at this athos would smile, with his charming, melancholy smile, which so
became his noble countenance, and porthos would drink, swearing that
aramis would never be anything but a village cure.

planchet, dâ€™artagnanâ€™s valet, supported his go

od fortune nobly. he
received thirty sous per day, and for a month he returned to his
lodgings gay as a chaffinch, and affable toward his master. when the
wind of adversity began to blow upon the housekeeping of the rue des
fossoyeurs--that is to say, when the forty pistoles of king louis xiii
were consumed or nearly so--he commenced complaints which athos thought
nauseous, porthos indecent, and aramis ridiculous. athos counseled
dâ€™artagnan to dismiss the fellow; porthos was of the opinion that he
should give him a good thrashing first; and aramis contended that a
master should never attend to anything but the civilities paid to him.

"this is all very easy for you to say," replied dâ€™artagnan, "for you,
athos, who live like a dumb man with grimaud, who forbid him to speak,
and consequently never exchange ill words with him; for you, porthos,
who carry matters in such a magnificent style,

and are a god to your
valet, mousqueton; and for you, aramis, who, always abstracted by your
theological studies, inspire your servant, bazin, a mild, religious man,
with a profound respect; but for me, who am without any settled means
and without resources--for me, who am neither a musketeer nor even a
guardsman, what am i to do to inspire either the affection, the terror,
or the respect in planchet?"

"this is serious," answered the three friends; "it is a family affair.
it is with valets as with wives, they must be placed at once upon the

his uniform, which he would have exchanged for that of a
musketeer at the expense of ten years of his existence. but m. de
treville promised this favor after a novitiate of two years--a novitiate
which might besides be abridged if an opportunity should present itself
for dâ€™artagnan to render the king any signal service, or to distinguish
himself by some brilliant action. upon this promise dâ€™artagnan withdrew,
and the next day he began service.

then it became the turn of athos, porthos, and aramis to mount guard
with dâ€™artagnan when he was on duty. the company of m. le chevalier
dessessart thus received four instead of one when it admitted
dâ€™artagnan.




8 concerning a court intrigue


in the meantime, the forty pistoles of king louis xiii, like all other
things of this world, after having had a beginning had an end, and after
this end our four companions began to be somewhat embarrassed. at first,
athos supported the association for a time with his own means.

porthos succeeded him

; and thanks to one of those disappearances to
which he was accustomed, he was able to provide for the wants of all for
a fortnight. at last it became aramisâ€™s turn, who performed it with a
good grace and who succeeded--as he said, by selling some theological
books--in procuring a few pistoles.

then, as they had been accustomed to do, they had recourse to m. de
treville, who made some advances on their pay; but these advances could
not go far with three musketeers who were already much in arrears and a
guardsman who as yet had no pay at all.

at length when they found they were likely to be really in want, they
got together, as a last effort, eig
 
 ___________________________
 
ht or ten pistoles, with which
porthos went to the gaming table. unfortunately he was in a bad vein; he
lost all, together with twenty-five pistoles for which he had given his
word.

then the inconvenience became distress. the hungry friends, followed by
their lackeys, were seen haunting the quays and guard rooms, picking up
among their friends abroad all the dinners they could meet with; for
according to the advice of aramis, it was prudent to sow repasts right
and left in prosperity, in order to reap a few in time of need.

athos was invited four times, and each time took his friends and their
lackeys with him. porthos had six occasions, and contrived in the same
manner that his friends should partake of them; aramis had eight of
them. he was a man, as must have been already perceived, who made but
little noise, and yet was much sought after.

as to dâ€™artagnan, who as yet knew nobody in the capital, he only foun

e guards. he took his army
to the priestâ€™s, where they devoured as much provision as would have
lasted him for two months, and to the cornetâ€™s, who performed wonders;
but as planchet said, "people do not eat at once for all time, even when
they eat a good deal."

dâ€™artagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one meal
and a half for his companions--as the breakfast at the priestâ€™s could
only be counted as half a repast--in return for the feasts which athos,
porthos, and aramis had procured him. he fancied himself a burden to the
society, forgetting in his perfectly juvenile good faith that he had fed
this society for a month; and he set his mind actively to work. he
reflected that this coalition of four young, brave, enterprising, and
active men ought to have some other object than swaggering walks,
fencing lessons, and practical jokes, more or less witty.

in fact, four men such as they were--four men devoted to one another,
from their purses to their lives; four me

, to
whom this man had confided some important missive.

the opinion of athos was that dâ€™artagnan had lost his letter in the
skirmish. a gentleman, in his opinion--and according to dâ€™artagnanâ€™s
portrait of him, the stranger must be a gentleman--would be incapable of
the baseness of stealing a letter.

porthos saw nothing in all this but a love meeting, given by a lady to a
cavalier, or by a cavalier to a lady, which had been disturbed by the
presence of dâ€™artagnan and his yellow horse.

aramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious, it was
better not to fathom them.

they understood, then, from the few words which escaped from dâ€™artagnan,
what affair was in hand, and as they thought that overtaking his man, or
losing sight of him, dâ€™artagnan would return to his rooms, they kept on
their way.

when they entered dâ€™artagnanâ€™s chamber, it was empty; the landlord,
dreading the consequences of the encounter which was doubtless about to
take place between the young man

ought to have
begun, and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had
leaned; but this proved useless--for though he knocked ten or twelve
times in succession, no one answered, and some of the neighbors, who put
their noses out of their windows or were brought to their doors by the
noise, had assured him that that house, all the openings of which were
tightly closed, had not been inhabited for six months.

while dâ€™artagnan was running through the streets and knocking at doors,
aramis had joined his companions; so that on returning home dâ€™artagnan
found the reunion complete.

"well!" cried the three musketeers all together, on seeing dâ€™artagnan
enter with his brow covered with perspiration and his countenance upset
with anger.

"well!" cried he, throwing his sword upon the bed, "this man must be the
devil in person; he has disappeared like a phantom, like a shade, like a
specter."

"do you believe in apparitions?" asked athos of porthos.

"i never believe in anything i h
 
 ___________________________
 
ave not seen, and as i never have seen
apparitions, i donâ€™t believe in them."

"the bible," said aramis, "makes our belief in them a law; the ghost of

"at all events, man or devil, body or shadow, illusion or reality, this
man is born for my damnation; for his flight has caused us to miss a
glorious affair, gentlemen--an affair by which there were a hundred
pistoles, and perhaps more, to be gained."

"how is that?" cried porthos and aramis in a breath.

his head through the half-open door in order to catch some fragments of
the conversation, "go down to my landlord, monsieur bonacieux, and ask
him to send me half a dozen bottles of beaugency wine; i prefer that."

"ah, ah! you have credit with your landlord, then?" asked porthos.

"yes," replied dâ€™artagnan, "from this very day; and mind, if the wine is
bad, we will send him to find better."

"we must use, and not abuse," said aramis, sententiously.

"i always said that dâ€™artagnan had the longest head of the four," said
athos, who, having uttered his opinion, to which dâ€™artagnan replied with
a bow, immediately resumed his accustomed silence.

"but come, what is this about?" asked porthos.

"yes," said aramis, "impart it to us, my dear friend, unless the honor
of any lady be hazarded by this confidence; in that case you would do
better to keep it to yourself."

"be satisfied," replied dâ€™artagnan; "the honor of no one w

connoisseur and indicated by a nod of his head that he thought the wine
good; "and one may draw fifty or sixty pistoles from this good man. then
there only remains to ascertain whether these fifty or sixty pistoles
are worth the risk of four heads."

"but observe," cried dâ€™artagnan, "that there is a woman in the affair--a
woman carried off, a woman who is doubtless threatened, tortured
perhaps, and all because she is faithful to her mistress."

"beware, dâ€™artagnan, beware," said aramis. "you grow a little too warm,
in my opinion, about the fate of madame bonacieux. woman was created for
our destruction, and it is from her we inherit all our miseries."

at this speech of aramis, the brow of athos became clouded and he bit
his lips.

"it is not madame bonacieux about whom i am anxious," cried dâ€™artagnan,
"but the queen, whom the king abandons, whom the cardinal persecutes,
and who sees the heads of all her friends fall, one after the other."

"why does she love what we hate m

e same soil as
herself. as to the second reproach, i have heard it said that she does
not love the english, but an englishman."

"well, and by my faith," said athos, "it must be acknowledged that this
englishman is worthy of being loved. i never saw a man with a nobler air
than his."

"without reckoning that he dresses as nobody else can," said porthos. "i
was at the louvre on the day when he scattered his pearls; and, pardieu,
i picked up two that i sold for ten pistoles each. do you know him,
aramis?"

"as well as you do, gentlemen; for i was among those who seized him in
the garden at amiens, into which monsieur putange, the queenâ€™s equerry,
introduced me. i was at school at the time, and the adventure appeared
to me to be cruel for the king."

"which would not prevent me," said dâ€™artagnan, "if i knew where the duke
of buckingham was, from taking him by the hand and conducting him to the
queen, were it only to enrage the cardinal, and if we could find means
to play him a sharp turn, i

 vow that i would voluntarily risk my head in
doing it."

"and did the mercer*," rejoined athos, "tell you, dâ€™artagnan, that the
queen thought that buckingham had been brought over by a forged letter?"

_*haberdasher_

"she is afraid so."

"wait a minute, then," said aramis.

"what for?" demanded porthos.

"go on, while i endeavor to recall circumstances."

"and now i am convinced," said dâ€™artagnan, "that this abduction of the
queenâ€™s woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking, and
perhaps with the presence of buckingham in paris."

"the gascon is full of ideas," said porthos, with admiration.

"i like to hear him talk," said athos; "his dialect amuses me."

"gentlemen," cried aramis, "listen to this."

"listen to aramis," said his three frien

"yesterday i was at the house of a doctor of theology, whom i sometimes
consult about my studies."

athos smiled.

"he resides in a quiet quarter," continued aramis; "his tastes and his
profession require it. now, at the moment when i left his house--"

here aramis paused.

"well," cried his auditors; "at the moment you left his house?"

aramis appeared to make a strong inward effort, like a man who, in the
full relation of a falsehood, finds himself stopped by some unforeseen
obstacle; but the eyes of his three companions were fixed upon him,
their ears were wide open, and there were no means of retreat.

"this doctor has a niece," continued aramis.

"ah, he has a niece!" interrupted porthos.

"a very respectable lady," said aramis.

the three friends burst into laughter.

"ah, if you laugh, if you doubt me," replied aramis, "you sha

"we believe like mohammedans, and are as mute as tombstones," said
athos.

"i will continue, then," resumed aramis. "this niece comes sometimes to
see her uncle; and by chance was there yesterday at the same time that i
was, and it was my duty to offer to conduct her to her carriage."

"ah! she has a carriage, then, this niece of the doctor?" interrupted
porthos, one of whose faults was a great looseness of tongue. "a nice
acquaintance, my friend!"

"porthos," replied aramis, "i have had the occasion to observe to you
more than once that you are very indiscreet; and that is injurious to
you among the women."

"gentlemen, gentlemen," cried dâ€™artagnan, who began to get a glimpse of
the result of the adventure, "the thing is serious. let us try not to
jest, if we can. go on aramis, go on."

"all at once, a tall, dark gentleman--just like yours, dâ€™artagnan."

"the same, perhaps," said he.

"possibly," continued aramis, "came toward me, accompanied by five or
six me

tone, â€™monsieur duke,â€™ said he to me, â€™and you madame,â€™ continued he,
addressing the lady on my arm--"

"the doctorâ€™s niece?"

"hold your tongue, porthos," said athos; "you are insupportable."

"â€™--will you enter this carriage, and that without offering the least
resistance, without making the least noise?â€™"

"he took you for buckingham!" cried dâ€™artagnan.

"i believe so," replied aramis.

"but the lady?" asked porthos.

"he took her for the queen!" said dâ€™artagnan.

"just so," replied aramis.

"the gascon is the devil!" cried athos; "nothing escapes him."

"the fact is," said porthos, "aramis is of the same height, and
something of the shape of the duke; but it nevertheless appears to me
that the dress of a musketeer--"

"i wore an enormous cloak," said aramis.

"in the month of july? the devil!" said porthos. "is the doctor afraid
that you may be recognized?"

"i can compre

hend that the spy may have been deceived by the person; but
the face--"

"i had a large hat," said aramis.

"oh, good lord," cried porthos, "what precautions for the study of
theology!"

"gentlemen, gentlemen," said dâ€™artagnan, "do not let us lose our time in
jesting. let us separate, and let us seek the mercerâ€™s wife--that is the
key of the intrigue."

"a woman of such inferior condition! can you believe so?" said porthos,
protruding his lips with contempt.

"she is goddaughter to laporte, the confidential valet of the queen.
have i not told you so, gentlemen? besides, it has perhaps been her

a bargain with the
mercer, and a good bargain."

"thatâ€™s useless," said dâ€™artagnan; "for i believe if he does not pay us,
we shall be well enough paid by another party."

at this moment a sudden noise of footsteps was heard upon the stairs;
the door was thrown violently open, and the unfortunate mercer rushed
into the chamber in which the council was held.

"save me, gentlemen, for the love of heaven, save me!" cried he. "there
are four men come to arrest me. save me! save me!"

porthos and aramis arose.

"a moment," cried dâ€™artagnan, making them a sign to replace in the
scabbard their half-drawn swords. "it is not courage that is needed; it
is prudence."

"and yet," cried porthos, "we will not leave--"

"you will leave dâ€™artagnan to act as he thinks proper," said athos. "he
has, i repeat, the longest head of the four, and for my part i declare
that i will obey him. do as you think best, dâ€™artagnan."

at this moment the four guards appeared at the door of the antechamber,

the leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of
dâ€™artagnan if the wine had been bad; but the wine was good, and he was
convinced.

"what diabolical villainy you have performed here," said porthos, when
the officer had rejoined his companions and the four friends found
themselves alone. "shame, shame, for four musketeers to allow an
unfortunate fellow who cried for help to be arrested in their midst! and
a gentleman to hobnob with a bailiff!"

"porthos," said aramis, "athos has already told you that you are a
simpleton, and i am quite of his opinion. dâ€™artagnan, you are a great
man; and when you occupy monsieur de trevilleâ€™s place, i will come and
ask your influence to secure me an abbey."

"well, i am in a maze," said porthos; "do you approve of what dâ€™artagnan
has done?"

"parbleu! indeed i do," said athos; "i not only approve of what he has
done, but i congratulate him upon it."

"and now, gentlemen," said dâ€™artagnan, without stopping to explain

 his
conduct to porthos, "all for one, one for all--that is our motto, is it
not?"

"and yet--" said porthos.

"hold out your hand and swear!" cried athos and aramis at once.

overcome by example, grumbling to himself, nevertheless, porthos
stretched out his hand, and the four friends repeated with one voice the
formula dictated by dâ€™artagnan:

"all for one, one for all."

"thatâ€™s well! now let us everyone retire to his own home," said
dâ€™artagnan, as if he had done nothing but command all his life; "and
attention! for from this moment we are at feud with the cardinal."

the voice became more and more indistinct; a tumultuous movement shook
the partition. the victim resisted as much as a woman could resist four
men.

"pardon, gentlemen--par--" murmured the voice, which could now only be
heard in inarticulate sounds.

"they are binding her; they are going to drag her away," cried
dâ€™artagnan to himself, springing up from the floor. "my sword! good, it
is by my side! planchet!"

"monsieur."

"run and seek athos, porthos and aramis. one of the three will certainly
be at home, perhaps all three. tell them to take arms, to come here, and
to run! ah, i remember, athos is at monsieur de trevilleâ€™s."

"but where are you going, monsieur, where are you going?"

"i am going down by the window, in order to be there the sooner," cried
dâ€™artagnan. "you put back the boards, sweep the floor, go out at the
door, and run as i told you."

"oh, monsieur! monsieur! you will kill yourself," cried planchet.

ght have confounded her with a lady of rank. the hands were
white, but without delicacy; the feet did not bespeak the woman of
quality. happily, dâ€™artagnan was not yet acquainted with such niceties.

while dâ€™artagnan was examining mme. bonacieux, and was, as we have said,
close to her, he saw on the ground a fine cambric handkerchief, which he
picked up, as was his habit, and at the corner of which he recognized
the same cipher he had seen on the handkerchief which had nearly caused
him and aramis to cut each otherâ€™s throat.

from that time, dâ€™artagnan had been cautious with respect to
handkerchiefs with arms on them, and he therefore placed in the pocket
of mme. bonacieux the one he had just picked up.

at that moment mme. bonacieux recovered her senses. she opened her eyes,
looked around her with terror, saw that the apartment was empty and that
she was alone with her liberator. she extended her hands to him with a
smile. mme. bonacieux had the sweetest smile in the world.

self; and although it is generally with her husbandâ€™s money that she
procures herself this indulgence, the gratitude for it seldom reverts to
him.

then dâ€™artagnan, disposed to become the most tender of lovers, was at
the same time a very devoted friend. in the midst of his amorous
projects for the mercerâ€™s wife, he did not forget his friends. the
pretty mme. bonacieux was just the woman to walk with in the plain st.
denis or in the fair of st. germain, in company with athos, porthos, and
aramis, to whom dâ€™artagnan had often remarked this. then one could enjoy
charming little dinners, where one touches on one side the hand of a
friend, and on the other the foot of a mistress. besides, on pressing
occasions, in extreme difficulties, dâ€™artagnan would become the
preserver of his friends.

and m. bonacieux, whom dâ€™artagnan had pushed into the hands of the
officers, denying him aloud although he had promised in a whisper to
save him? we are compelled to admit to our readers that dâ€™a

if dâ€™artagnan forgets his host, or
appears to forget him, under the pretense of not knowing where he has
been carried, we will not forget him, and we know where he is. but for
the moment, let us do as did the amorous gascon; we will see after the
worthy mercer later.

dâ€™artagnan, reflecting on his future amours, addressing himself to the
beautiful night, and smiling at the stars, ascended the rue
cherish-midi, or chase-midi, as it was then called. as he found himself
in the quarter in which aramis lived, he took it into his head to pay
his friend a visit in order to explain the motives which had led him to
send planchet with a request that he would come instantly to the
mousetrap. now, if aramis had been at home when planchet came to his
abode, he had doubtless hastened to the rue des fossoyeurs, and finding
nobody there but his other two companions perhaps, they would not be
able to conceive what all this meant. this mystery required an
explanation; at least, so dâ€™artagnan declared to

nan was passing along a lane on the spot
where the rue dâ€™assas is now situated, breathing the balmy emanations
which were borne upon the wind from the rue de vaugirard, and which
arose from the gardens refreshed by the dews of evening and the breeze
of night. from a distance resounded, deadened, however, by good
shutters, the songs of the tipplers, enjoying themselves in the cabarets
scattered along the plain. arrived at the end of the lane, dâ€™artagnan
turned to the left. the house in which aramis dwelt was situated between
the rue cassette and the rue servandoni.

dâ€™artagnan had just passed the rue cassette, and already perceived the
door of his friendâ€™s house, shaded by a mass of sycamores and clematis
which formed a vast arch opposite the front of it, when he perceived
something like a shadow issuing from the rue servandoni. this something
was enveloped in a cloak, and dâ€™artagnan at first believed it was a man;
but by the smallness of the form, the hesitation of the walk, and th

oung; perhaps she is pretty. oh, yes! but a woman who wanders
in the streets at this hour only ventures out to meet her lover. if i
should disturb a rendezvous, that would not be the best means of
commencing an acquaintance."

meantime the young woman continued to advance, counting the houses and
windows. this was neither long nor difficult. there were but three
hotels in this part of the street; and only two windows looking toward
the road, one of which was in a pavilion parallel to that which aramis
occupied, the other belonging to aramis himself.

"paridieu!" said dâ€™artagnan to himself, to whose mind the niece of the
theologian reverted, "pardieu, it would be droll if this belated dove
should be in search of our friendâ€™s house. but on my soul, it looks so.
ah, my dear aramis, this time i shall find you out." and dâ€™artagnan,
making himself as small as he could, concealed himself in the darkest
side of the street near a stone bench placed at the back of a niche.

the young woman conti

nued to advance; and in addition to the lightness
of her step, which had betrayed her, she emitted a little cough which
denoted a sweet voice. dâ€™artagnan believed this cough to be a signal.

nevertheless, whether the cough had been answered by a similar signal
which had fixed the irresolution of the nocturnal seeker, or whether
without this aid she saw that she had arrived at the end of her journey,
she resolutely drew near to aramisâ€™s shutter, and tapped, at three equal
intervals, with her bent finger.

"this is all very fine, dear aramis," murmured dâ€™artagnan. "ah, monsieur
hypocrite, i understand how you study theology."

the three blows were scarcely struck, when the inside blind was opened
and a light appeared through the panes of the outside shutter.

"ah, ah!" said the listener, "not through doors, but through windows!
ah, this visit was expected. we shall see the windows open, and the lady

ons have, as it is asserted, like those of cats, the faculty of
seeing in the dark.

dâ€™artagnan then saw that the young woman took from her pocket a white
object, which she unfolded quickly, and which took the form of a
handkerchief. she made her interlocutor observe the corner of this
unfolded object.

this immediately recalled to dâ€™artagnanâ€™s mind the handkerchief which he
had found at the feet of mme. bonacieux, which had reminded him of that
which he had dragged from under the feet of aramis.

"what the devil could that handkerchief signify?"

placed where he was, dâ€™artagnan could not perceive the face of aramis.
we say aramis, because the young man entertained no doubt that it was
his friend who held this dialogue from the interior with the lady of the
exterior. curiosity prevailed over prudence; and profiting by the
preoccupation into which the sight of the handkerchief appeared to have
plunged the two personages now on the scene, he stole from his hiding
place, and quick as li

ghtning, but stepping with utmost caution, he ran
and placed himself close to the angle of the wall, from which his eye
could pierce the interior of aramisâ€™s room.

upon gaining this advantage dâ€™artagnan was near uttering a cry of
surprise; it was not aramis who was conversing with the nocturnal
visitor, it was a woman! dâ€™artagnan, however, could only see enough to
recognize the form of her vestments, not enough to distinguish her
features.

at the same instant the woman inside drew a second handkerchief from her
pocket, and exchanged it for that which had just been shown to her. then
some words were spoken by the two women. at length the shutter closed.
the woman who was outside the window turned round, and passed within
four steps of dâ€™artagn

"was it with that intention you followed me?" asked the young woman,
with a coquettish smile, whose somewhat bantering character resumed its
influence, and with whom all fear had disappeared from the moment in
which she recognized a friend in one she had taken for an enemy.

"no," said dâ€™artagnan; "no, i confess it. it was chance that threw me in
your way; i saw a woman knocking at the window of one of my friends."

"one of your friends?" interrupted mme. bonacieux.

"without doubt; aramis is one of my best friends."

"aramis! who is he?"

"come, come, you wonâ€™t tell me you donâ€™t know aramis?"

"this is the first time i ever heard his name pronounced."

"it is the first time, then, that you ever went to that house?"

"undoubtedly."

"and you did not know that it was inhabited by a young man?"

"no."

"by a musketeer?"

"no, indeed!"

"it was not he, then, you came to seek?"

"not the least in the world. besides, you must have seen that the person
to whom i spoke was a woman."

"that is true; but this woman is a friend of aramis--"

"my dear madame bonacieux, you are charming; but at the same time you
are one of the most mysterious women."

"do i lose by that?"

"no; you are, on the contrary, adorable."

"now escort me."

more than if you had never seen me."

"must aramis do as much as i, madame?" said dâ€™artagnan, deeply piqued.

"this is the second or third time, monsieur, that you have repeated that
name, and yet i have told you that i do not know him."

"you do not know the man at whose shutter you have just knocked? indeed,
madame, you believe me too credulous!"

"confess that it is for the sake of making me talk that you invent this
story and create this personage."

"i invent nothing, madame; i create nothing. i only speak that exact
truth."

"and you sa

"i say so, and i repeat it for the third time; that house is one
inhabited by my friend, and that friend is aramis."

"all this will be cleared up at a later period," murmured the young
woman; "no, monsieur, be silent."

"if you could see my heart," said dâ€™artagnan, "you would there read so
much curiosity that you would pity me and so much love that you would
instantly satisfy my curiosity. we have nothing to fear from those who
love us."

"you speak very suddenly of love, monsieur," said the young woman,
shaking her head.

"that is because love has come suddenly upon me, and for the first time;

the young woman looked at him furtively.

"listen; i am already upon the scent," resumed dâ€™artagnan. "about three
months ago i was near having a duel with aramis concerning a
handkerchief resembling the one you showed to the woman in his
house--for a handkerchief marked in the same manner, i am sure."

"monsieur," said the young woman, "you weary me very much, i assure you,
with your questions."

"but you, madame, prudent as you are, think, if you were to be arrested
with that handkerchief, and that handkerchief were to be seized, would
you not be compromised?"

had depended upon the spot to which she was
going or upon the person who should accompany her, dâ€™artagnan would have
returned home, since he had so promised. five minutes later he was in
the rue des fossoyeurs.

"poor athos!" said he; "he will never guess what all this means. he will
have fallen asleep waiting for me, or else he will have returned home,
where he will have learned that a woman had been there. a woman with
athos! after all," continued dâ€™artagnan, "there was certainly one with
aramis. all this is very strange; and i am curious to know how it will
end."

"badly, monsieur, badly!" replied a voice which the young man recognized
as that of planchet; for, soliloquizing aloud, as very preoccupied
people do, he had entered the alley, at the end of which were the stairs
which led to his chamber.

"how, badly? what do you mean by that, you idiot?" asked dâ€™artagnan.
"what has happened?"

"all sorts of misfortunes."

"what?"

"in the first place, monsieur athos is arrested."

"arres

"bravo, athos! noble heart!" murmured dâ€™artagnan. "i know him well
there! and what did the officers do?"

"four conveyed him away, i donâ€™t know where--to the bastille or fort

and took all the papers. the last two mounted guard at the door during
this examination; then, when all was over, they went away, leaving the
house empty and exposed."

"and porthos and aramis?"

"i could not find them; they did not come."

"but they may come any moment, for you left word that i awaited them?"

"yes, monsieur."

"well, donâ€™t budge, then; if they come, tell them what has happened. let
them wait for me at the pomme-de-pin. here it would be dangerous; the
house may be watched. i will run to monsieur de treville to tell them
all this, and will meet them there."

"very well, monsieur," said planchet.

"but you will remain; you are not afraid?" said dâ€™artagnan, coming

 order to take the new bridge. he had at first an idea of
crossing by the ferry; but on gaining the riverside, he had mechanically
put his hand into his pocket, and perceived that he had not wherewithal
to pay his passage.

as he gained the top of the rue guenegaud, he saw two persons coming out
of the rue dauphine whose appearance very much struck him. of the two
persons who composed this group, one was a man and the other a woman.
the woman had the outline of mme. bonacieux; the man resembled aramis so
much as to be mistaken for him.

besides, the woman wore that black mantle which dâ€™artagnan could still
see outlined on the shutter of the rue de vaugirard and on the door of
the rue de la harpe; still further, the man wore the uniform of a
musketeer.

the womanâ€™s hood was pulled down, and the man held a handkerchief to his
face. both, as this double precaution indicated, had an interest in not
being recognized.

they took the bridge. that was dâ€™artagnanâ€™s road, as he was going to th

he had not gone twenty steps before he became convinced that the woman
was really mme. bonacieux and that the man was aramis.

he felt at that instant all the suspicions of jealousy agitating his
heart. he felt himself doubly betrayed, by his friend and by her whom he
already loved like a mistress. mme. bonacieux had declared to him, by
all the gods, that she did not know aramis; and a quarter of an hour
after having made this assertion, he found her hanging on the arm of
aramis.

dâ€™artagnan did not reflect that he had only known the mercerâ€™s pretty
wife for three hours; that she owed him nothing but a little gratitude
for having delivered her from the men in black, who wished to carry her
off, and that she had promised him nothing. he considered himself an
outraged, betrayed, and ridiculed lover. blood and anger mounted to his
face; he was resolved to unravel the

their speed. dâ€™artagnan determined upon his course. he passed them, then
returned so as to meet them exactly before the samaritaine, which was
illuminated by a lamp which threw its light over all that part of the
bridge.

dâ€™artagnan stopped before them, and they stopped before him.

"what do you want, monsieur?" demanded the musketeer, recoiling a step,
and with a foreign accent, which proved to dâ€™artagnan that he was
deceived in one of his conjectures.

"it is not aramis!" cried he.

"no, monsieur, it is not aramis; and by your exclamation i perceive you
have mistaken me for another, and pardon you."

"you pardon me?" cried dâ€™artagnan.

"yes," replied the stranger. "allow me, then, to pass on, since it is
not with me you have anything to do."

"you are right, monsieur, it is not with you that i have anything to do;
it is with madame."

"with madame! you do not know her," replied the stranger.

"you are deceived, monsieur; i know her very well."

ord under his arm, allowed the duke and
mme. bonacieux to take twenty steps ahead, and then followed them, ready
to execute the instructions of the noble and elegant minister of charles

fortunately, he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his
devotion, and the young woman and the handsome musketeer entered the
louvre by the wicket of the echelle without any interference.

as for dâ€™artagnan, he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the
pomme-de-pin, where he found porthos and aramis awaiting him. without
giving them any explanation of the alarm and inconvenience he had caused
them, he told them that he had terminated the affair alone in which he
had for a moment believed he should need their assistance.

meanwhile, carried away as we are by our narrative, we must leave our
three friends to themselves, and follow the duke of buckingham and his
guide through the labyrinths of the louvre.

here is what the letter contained:

milady, be at the first ball at which the duke of buckingham shall be
present. he will wear on his doublet twelve diamond studs; get as near
to him as you can, and cut off two.

as soon as these studs shall be in your possession, inform me.




15 men of the robe and men of the sword


on the day after these events had taken place, athos not having
reappeared, m. de treville was informed by dâ€™artagnan and porthos of the
circumstance. as to aramis, he had asked for leave of absence for five
days, and was gone, it was said, to rouen on family business.

m de treville was the father of his soldiers. the lowest or the least
known of them, as soon as he assumed the uniform of the company, was as
sure of his aid and support as if he had been his own brother.

he repaired, then, instantly to the office of the lieutenant-criminel.
the officer who commanded the post of the red cross was sent for, and by
successive inquiries they learned that ath

"my love for you. speak! command! what is to be done?"

"my god, my god!" murmured the young woman, "ought i to confide such a
secret to you, monsieur? you are almost a boy."

"i see that you require someone to answer for me?"

"i admit that would reassure me greatly."

"do you know athos?"

"no."

"porthos?"

"no."

"aramis?"

"no. who are these gentleman?"

"three of the kingâ€™s musketeers. do you know monsieur de treville, their
captain?"

"oh, yes, him! i know him; not personally, but from having heard the
queen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal gentleman."

"you do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal?"

"oh, no, certainly not!"

"well, reveal your secret to him, and ask him whether, however
important, however valuable, however terrible it may be, you may not
confide it to me."

"i am going alone."

"in that case you will not get beyond bondy. i tell you so, by the faith
of de treville."

"how so?"

"you will be assassinated."

"and i shall die in the performance of my duty."

"but your mission will not be accomplished."

"that is true," replied dâ€™artagnan.

"believe me," continued treville, "in enterprises of this kind, in order
that one may arrive, four must set out."

"ah, you are right, monsieur," said dâ€™artagnan; "but you know athos,
porthos, and aramis, and you know if i can dispose of them."

"without confiding to them the secret which i am not willing to know?"

"we are sworn, once for all, to implicit confidence and devotedness
against all proof. besides, you can tell them that you have full
confidence in me, and they will not be more incredulous than you."

"i can send to each of them leave of absence for fifteen days, that is
all--to athos, whose wound still makes him suffer, to go to the waters
of forges; to porthos and aramis to accomp

e you any money?"

dâ€™artagnan tapped the bag he had in his pocket.

"enough?" asked m. de treville.

"three hundred pistoles."

"oh, plenty! that would carry you to the end of the world. begone,
then!"

dâ€™artagnan saluted m. de treville, who held out his hand to him;
dâ€™artagnan pressed it with a respect mixed with gratitude. since his
first arrival at paris, he had had constant occasion to honor this
excellent man, whom he had always found worthy, loyal, and great.

his first visit was to aramis, at whose residence he had not been since
the famous evening on which he had followed mme. bonacieux. still
further, he had seldom seen the young musketeer; but every time he had
seen him, he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his countenance.

this evening, especially, aramis was melancholy and thoughtful.
dâ€™artagnan asked some questions about this prolonged melancholy. aramis
pleaded as his excuse a commentary upon the eighteenth chapter of st.
augustine, which he was forced to write 
 
 ___________________________
 
in latin for the following week,
and which preoccupied him a good deal.

after the two friends had been chatting a few moments, a servant from m.
de treville entered, bringing a sealed packet.

"what is that?" asked aramis.

"the leave of absence monsieur has asked for," replied the lackey.

"for me! i have asked for no leave of absence."

"hold your tongue and take it!" said dâ€™artagnan. "and you, my friend,
there is a demipistole for your trouble; you will tell monsieur de
treville that monsieur aramis is very much obliged to him. go."

the lackey bowed to the ground and departed.

"what does all this mean?" asked aramis.

"pack up all you want for a journey of a fortnight, and follow me."

"but i cannot leave

 paris just now without knowing--"

aramis stopped.

"what is become of her? i suppose you mean--" continued dâ€™artagnan.

"become of whom?" replied aramis.

"the woman who was here--the woman with the embroidered handkerchief."

"who told you there was a woman here?" replied aramis, becoming as pale
as death.

"i saw her."

"and you know who she is?"

"i believe i can guess, at least."

"listen!" said aramis. "since you appear to know so many things, can you
tell me what is become of that woman?"

"i presume that she has returned to tours."

"to tours? yes, that may be. you evidently know her. but why did she
return to tours without telling me anything?"

"because she was in fear of being arrested."

"why has she not written to me, then?"

"because she was afraid of compromising you."

"dâ€™artagnan, you restore me to life!" cried aramis. "i fancied myself
despised, betrayed. i was so delighted to

see her again! i could not
have believed she would risk her liberty for me, and yet for what other
cause could she have returned to paris?"

"for the cause which today takes us to england."

"and what is this cause?" demanded aramis.

"oh, youâ€™ll know it someday, aramis; but at present i must imitate the
discretion of â€™the doctorâ€™s niece.â€™"

aramis smiled, as he remembered the tale he had told his friends on a
certain evening. "well, then, since she has left paris, and you are sure
of it, dâ€™artagnan, nothing prevents me, and i am ready to follow you.
you say we are going--"

"to see athos now, and if you will come thither, i beg you to make
haste, for we have lost much time already. a propos, inform bazin."

"will bazin go with us?" asked aramis.

"perhaps so. at all events, it is best that he should follow us to
athosâ€™s."

aramis cal

having ordered him to join them at
athosâ€™s residence, said "let us go then," at the same time taking his
cloak, sword, and three pistols, opening uselessly two or three drawers
to see if he could not find stray coin. when well assured this search
was superfluous, he followed dâ€™artagnan, wondering to himself how this
young guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had
given hospitality, and that he should know better than himself what had
become of her.

only as they went out aramis placed his hand upon the arm of dâ€™artagnan,
and looking at him earnestly, "you have not spoken of this lady?" said
he.

"to nobody in the world."

"not even to athos or porthos?"

"i have not breathed a syllable to them."

"good enough!"

tranquil on this important point, aramis continued his way with
dâ€™artagnan, and both soon arrived at athosâ€™s dwelling. they found him
holding his leave of absence in one hand, and m. de trevilleâ€™s note in
the other.

"can you explain to me what signify

s of forges?"

"there or elsewhere."

"in the kingâ€™s service?"

"either the kingâ€™s or the queenâ€™s. are we not their majestiesâ€™
servants?"

at that moment porthos entered. "pardieu!" said he, "here is a strange
thing! since when, i wonder, in the musketeers, did they grant men leave
of absence without their asking for it?"

"since," said dâ€™artagnan, "they have friends who ask it for them."

"ah, ah!" said porthos, "it appears thereâ€™s something fresh here."

"yes, we are going--" said aramis.

"to what country?" demanded porthos.

"my faith! i donâ€™t know much about it," said athos. "ask dâ€™artagnan."

"to london, gentlemen," said dâ€™artagnan.

"to london!" cried porthos; "and what the devil are we going to do in
london?"

"that is what i am not at liberty to tell you, gentlemen; you must trust
to me."

"but in order to go to london," added porthos, "money is needed, and i
have none."

"nor i," said aramis.

"nor i," said athos.

"i have," replied dâ€™artagnan, pulling out his t

london and back. besides, make yourselves easy; we shall not all arrive
at london."

"why so?"

"because, in all probability, some one of us will be left on the road."

"is this, then, a campaign upon which we are now entering?"

"one of a most dangerous kind, i give you notice."

"ah! but if we do risk being killed," said porthos, "at least i should
like to know what for."

"you would be all the wiser," said athos.

"and yet," said aramis, "i am somewhat of porthosâ€™s opinion."

"is the king accustomed to give you such reasons? no. he says to you
jauntily, â€™gentlemen, there is fighting going on in gascony or in
flanders; go and fight,â€™ and you go there. why? you need give yourselves
no more uneasiness about this."

"dâ€™artagnan is right," said athos; "here are our three leaves of absence
which came from monsieur de treville, and here are three hundred
pistoles which came from i donâ€™t know where. so let us go and get kill

"and i also," said porthos.

"and i also," said aramis. "and, indeed, i am not sorry to quit paris; i
had need of distraction."

"well, you will have distractions enough, gentlemen, be assured," said
dâ€™artagnan.

"and, now, when are we to go?" asked athos.

"immediately," replied dâ€™artagnan; "we have not a minute to lose."

"hello, grimaud! planchet! mousqueton! bazin!" cried the four young men,
calling their lackeys, "clean my boots, and fetch the horses from the
hotel."

each musketeer was accustomed to leave at the general hotel, as at a

of his lackey. planchet, grimaud,
mousqueton, and bazin set off at full speed.

"now let us lay down the plan of campaign," said porthos. "where do we
go first?"

"to calais," said dâ€™artagnan; "that is the most direct line to london."

"well," said porthos, "this is my advice--"

"speak!"

"four men traveling together would be suspected. dâ€™artagnan will give
each of us his instructions. i will go by the way of boulogne to clear
the way; athos will set out two hours after, by that of amiens; aramis
will follow us by that of noyon; as to dâ€™artagnan, he will go by what
route he thinks is best, in planchetâ€™s clothes, while planchet will
follow us like dâ€™artagnan, in the uniform of the guards."

"gentlemen," said athos, "my opinion is that it is not proper to allow
lackeys to have anything to do in such an affair. a secret may, by
chance, be betrayed by gentlemen; but it is almost always sold by
lackeys."

"porthosâ€™s plan appears to me to be impracticable," said dâ€™artagnan,
"inasmuc

ou will show your leaves of absence. if we are
attacked, we will defend ourselves; if we are tried, we will stoutly
maintain that we were only anxious to dip ourselves a certain number of
times in the sea. they would have an easy bargain of four isolated men;
whereas four men together make a troop. we will arm our four lackeys
with pistols and musketoons; if they send an army out against us, we
will give battle, and the survivor, as dâ€™artagnan says, will carry the
letter."

"well said," cried aramis; "you donâ€™t often speak, athos, but when you
do speak, it is like st. john of the golden mouth. i agree to athosâ€™s
plan. and you, porthos?"

"i agree to it, too," said porthos, "if dâ€™artagnan approves of it.
dâ€™artagnan, being the bearer of the letter, is naturally the head of the
enterprise; let him decide, and we will execute."

"well," said dâ€™artagnan, "i decide that we should adopt athosâ€™s plan,
and that we set off in half an hour."

"agreed!" shouted the three musketeers in chor

 stranger drew his sword.

"you have committed a piece of folly," said athos, "but it canâ€™t be
helped; there is no drawing back. kill the fellow, and rejoin us as soon
as you can."

all three remounted their horses, and set out at a good pace, while
porthos was promising his adversary to perforate him with all the
thrusts known in the fencing schools.

"there goes one!" cried athos, at the end of five hundred paces.

"but why did that man attack porthos rather than any other one of us?"
asked aramis.

"because, as porthos was talking louder than the rest of us, he took him
for the chief," said dâ€™artagnan.

"i always said that this cadet from gascony was a well of wisdom,"
murmured athos; and the travelers continued their route.

at beauvais they stopped two hours, as well to breathe their horses a
little as to wait for porthos. at the end of two hours, as porthos did
not come, not any news of him, they resumed their journey.

at a league from beauvais, where the road was confined between
 
 ___________________________
 
 two high
banks, they fell in with eight or ten men who, taking advantage of the
road being unpaved in this spot, appeared to be employed in digging
holes and filling up the ruts with mud.

aramis, not liking to soil his boots with this artificial mortar,
apostrophized them rather sharply. athos wished to restrain him, but it
was too late. the laborers began to jeer the travelers and by their
insolence disturbed the equanimity even of the cool athos, who urged on
his horse against one of them.

then each of these men retreated as far as the ditch, from which each
took a concealed musket; the result was that our seven travelers were
outnumbered in weapons. aramis received a ball which pas

sed through his
shoulder, and mousqueton another ball which lodged in the fleshy part
which prolongs the lower portion of the loins. therefore mousqueton
alone fell from his horse, not because he was severely wounded, but not
being able to see the wound, he judged it to be more serious than it
really was.

"it was an ambuscade!" shouted dâ€™artagnan. "donâ€™t waste a charge!
forward!"

aramis, wounded as he was, seized the mane of his horse, which carried
him on with the others. mousquetonâ€™s horse rejoined them, and galloped
by the side of his companions.

"that will serve us for a relay," said athos.

"i would rather have had a hat," said dâ€™artagnan. "mine was carried away
by a ball. by my faith, it is very fortunate that the letter was not in
it."

"theyâ€™ll kill poor porthos when he comes up," said aramis.

"if porthos were on his legs, he would have rejoined us by this time

,"
said athos. "my opinion is that on the ground the drunken man was not
intoxicated."

they continued at their best speed for two hours, although the horses
were so fatigued that it was to be feared they would soon refuse
service.

the travelers had chosen crossroads in the hope that they might meet
with less interruption; but at crevecoeur, aramis declared he could
proceed no farther. in fact, it required all the courage which he
concealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so
far. he grew more pale every minute, and they were obliged to support
him on his horse. they lifted him off at the door of a cabaret, left
bazin with him, who, besides, in a skirmish was more embarrassing than
useful, and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at amiens.

"morbleu," said athos, as soon as they were again in motion, "reduce

master."

planchet, emboldened by the first exploit, sprang upon lubin; and being
strong and vigorous, he soon got him on the broad of his back, and
placed his knee upon his breast.

"go on with your affair, monsieur," cried planchet; "i have finished
mine."

seeing this, the gentleman drew his sword, and sprang upon dâ€™artagnan;
but he had too strong an adversary. in three seconds dâ€™artagnan had
wounded him three times, exclaiming at each thrust, "one for athos, one
for porthos; and one for aramis!"

at the third hit the gentleman fell like a log. dâ€™artagnan believed him
to be dead, or at least insensible, and went toward him for the purpose
of taking the order; but the moment he extended his hand to search for
it, the wounded man, who had not dropped his sword, plunged the point
into dâ€™artagnanâ€™s breast, crying, "one for you!"

"and one for me--the best for last!" cried dâ€™artagnan, furious, nailing
him to the earth with a fourth thrust through his body.

this time the gentleman

tment mme. bonacieux had made with him
for that very evening; but we are bound to say, to the credit of our
hero, that the bad opinion entertained by m. de treville of women in
general, did not inspire him with the least suspicion of his pretty
hostess.

"but, a propos," resumed m. de treville, "what has become of your three
companions?"

"i was about to ask you if you had heard any news of them?"

"none, monsieur."

"well, i left them on my road--porthos at chantilly, with a duel on his
hands; aramis at crevecoeur, with a ball in his shoulder; and athos at
amiens, detained by an accusation of coining."

"see there, now!" said m. de treville; "and how the devil did you
escape?"

"by a miracle, monsieur, i must acknowledge, with a sword thrust in my
breast, and by nailing the comte de wardes on the byroad to calais, like
a butterfly on a tapestry."

"there again! de wardes, one of the cardinalâ€™s men, a cousin of
rochefort! stop, my friend, i have an idea."

"speak, monsieur."

"in your plac

t, i think, is as much as i shall
want."

"but your companions?"

"i donâ€™t think they can be in need of any. we left paris, each with
seventy-five pistoles in his pocket."

"shall i see you again before your departure?"

"i think not, monsieur, unless something new should happen."

"well, a pleasant journey."

"thanks, monsieur."

dâ€™artagnan left m. de treville, touched more than ever by his paternal
solicitude for his musketeers.

he called successively at the abodes of athos, porthos, and aramis.
neither of them had returned. their lackeys likewise were absent, and
nothing had been heard of either the one or the other. he would have
inquired after them of their mistresses, but he was neither acquainted
with porthosâ€™s nor aramisâ€™s, and as to athos, he had none.

as he passed the hotel des gardes, he took a glance in to the stables.
three of the four horses had already arrived. planchet, all
astonishment, was busy grooming them, and had already finished two.

"ah, monsieur," said pla
 
 ___________________________
 
 and as i am not a
gentleman, i may be allowed to lie."

"be of good heart, planchet, you shall preserve your reputation as a
veracious man. in a quarter of an hour we set off."

"thatâ€™s the advice i was about to give monsieur; and where are we going,
may i ask, without being too curious?"

"pardieu! in the opposite direction to that which you said i was gone.
besides, are you not as anxious to learn news of grimaud, mousqueton,
and bazin as i am to know what has become of athos, porthos, and
aramis?"

"yes, monsieur," said planchet, "and i will go as soon as you please.
indeed, i think provincial air will suit us much better just now than
the air of paris. so then--"

"so then, pack up our luggage, planchet, and let us be off. on my part,
i will go out with my hands in my pockets, that nothing may be
suspected. you may join me at the hotel des gardes. by the way,
planchet, i think you are right with respect to our host, and that he is
decidedly a frightfully low wretch."

"ah, monsieur, y
 
 ___________________________
 
ou may take my word when i tell you anything. i am a
physiognomist, i assure you."

dâ€™artagnan went out first, as had been agreed upon. then, in order that
he might have nothing to reproach himself with, he directed his steps,
for the last time, toward the residences of his three friends. no news
had been received of them; only a letter, all perfumed and of an elegant
writing in small characters, had come for aramis. dâ€™artagnan took charge
of it. ten minutes afterward planchet joined him at the stables of the
hotel des gardes. dâ€™artagnan, in order that there might be no time lost,
had saddled his horse himself.

"thatâ€™s well," said he to planchet, when the latter added the
portmanteau to the equipment. "now saddle the other three horses."

"do you think, then, monsieur, that we shall travel faster with two
horses apiece?" said planchet, with his shrewd air.

"no, monsieur jester," replied dâ€™artagna

ut prejudice say what you think of it?"

"thank you, my friend, thank you; unfortunately, i have just
breakfasted."

"well," said porthos, "arrange the table, mousqueton, and while we
breakfast, dâ€™artagnan will relate to us what has happened to him during
the ten days since he left us."

"willingly," said dâ€™artagnan.

while porthos and mousqueton were breakfasting, with the appetites of
convalescents and with that brotherly cordiality which unites men in
misfortune, dâ€™artagnan related how aramis, being wounded, was obliged to
stop at crevecoeur, how he had left athos fighting at amiens with four
men who accused him of being a coiner, and how he, dâ€™artagnan, had been
forced to run the comtes de wardes through the body in order to reach
england.

but there the confidence of dâ€™artagnan stopped. he only added that on
his return from great britain he had brought back four magnificent
horses--one for himself, and one for each of his companions; then he
informed porthos that the one inten

still at the great st. martin, he would call for him on his way.

porthos replied that in all probability his sprain would not permit him
to depart yet awhile. besides, it was necessary he should stay at
chantilly to wait for the answer from his duchess.

dâ€™artagnan wished that answer might be prompt and favorable; and having
again recommended porthos to the care of mousqueton, and paid his bill
to the host, he resumed his route with planchet, already relieved of one
of his led horses.




26 aramis and his thesis


dâ€™artagnan had said nothing to porthos of his wound or of his
procuratorâ€™s wife. our bearnais was a prudent lad, however young he
might be. consequently he had appeared to believe all that the
vainglorious musketeer had told him, convinced that no friendship will
hold out against a surprised secret. besides, we feel always a sort of
mental superiority over those whose lives we know better than they
suppose. in his projects of intrigue for the future, and determined as
he wa

memory but a vague mist in which a thousand confused images of trees,
mountains, and landscapes are lost. it was as a prey to this
hallucination that dâ€™artagnan traveled, at whatever pace his horse
pleased, the six or eight leagues that separated chantilly from
crevecoeur, without his being able to remember on his arrival in the
village any of the things he had passed or met with on the road.

there only his memory returned to him. he shook his head, perceived the
cabaret at which he had left aramis, and putting his horse to the trot,
he shortly pulled up at the door.

this time it was not a host but a hostess who received him. dâ€™artagnan
was a physiognomist. his eye took in at a glance the plump, cheerful
countenance of the mistress of the place, and he at once perceived there
was no occasion for dissembling with her, or of fearing anything from
one blessed with such a joyous physiognomy.

"my good dame," asked dâ€™artagnan, "can you tell me what has become of
one of my friends, whom we
 
 ___________________________
 
 were obliged to leave here about a dozen days
ago?"

"a handsome young man, three- or four-and-twenty years old, mild,
amiable, and well made?"

"that is he--wounded in the shoulder."

"just so. well, monsieur, he is still here."

"ah, pardieu! my dear dame," said dâ€™artagnan, springing from his horse,
and throwing the bridle to planchet, "you restore me to life; where is
this dear aramis? let me embrace him, i am in a hurry to see him again."

"pardon, monsieur, but i doubt whether he can see you at this moment."

"why so? has he a lady with him?"

"jesus! what do you mean by that? poor lad! no, monsieur, he has not a
lady with him."

"with whom is he, then?"

"with the curate of montdidier and the superior of the jesuits of
amiens."

"good heavens!" cried dâ€™artagnan, "is the poor fellow worse, then?"

"no, monsieur, quite the contrary; but after his illness grace touched
him
 
 ___________________________
 
ten that he was only a
musketeer for a time."

"monsieur still insists upon seeing him?"

"more than ever."

"well, monsieur has only to take the right-hand staircase in the
courtyard, and knock at number five on the second floor."

dâ€™artagnan walked quickly in the direction indicated, and found one of
those exterior staircases that are still to be seen in the yards of our
old-fashioned taverns. but there was no getting at the place of sojourn
of the future abbe; the defiles of the chamber of aramis were as well
guarded as the gardens of armida. bazin was stationed in the corridor,
and barred his passage with the more intrepidity that, after many years
of trial, bazin found himself near a result of which he had ever been
ambitious.

in fact, the dream of poor bazin had always been to serve a churchman;
and he awaited with impatience the moment, always in the future, when
aramis would throw aside the uniform and assume the cassock. the
daily-renewed promise of the young man that the moment 
 
 ___________________________
 
would not long be
delayed, had alone kept him in the service of a musketeer--a service in
which, he said, his soul was in constant jeopardy.

bazin was then at the height of joy. in all probability, this time his
master would not retract. the union of physical pain with moral
uneasiness had produced the effect so long desired. aramis, suffering at
once in body and mind, had at length fixed his eyes and his thoughts
upon religion, and he had considered as a warning from heaven the double
accident which had happened to him; that is to say, the sudden
disappearance of his mistress and the wound in his shoulder.

it may be easily understood that in the present disposition of his
master nothing could be more disagreeable to bazin than the arrival of
dâ€™artagnan, which might cast his master back again into that vortex of
mundane
 
 ___________________________
 
 affairs which had so long carried him away. he resolved, then,
to defend the door bravely; and as, betrayed by the mistress of the inn,
he could not say that aramis was absent, he endeavored to prove to the
newcomer that it would be the height of indiscretion to disturb his
master in his pious conference, which had commenced with the morning and
would not, as bazin said, terminate before night.

but dâ€™artagnan took very little heed of the eloquent discourse of m.
bazin; and as he had no desire to support a polemic discussion with his
friendâ€™s valet, he simply moved him out of the way with one hand, and
with the other turned the handle of the door of nu

opened, and dâ€™artagnan went into the chamber.

aramis, in a black gown, his head enveloped in a sort of round flat cap,
not much unlike a calotte, was seated before an oblong table, covered
with rolls of paper and enormous volumes in folio. at his right hand was
placed the superior of the jesuits, and on his left the curate of
montdidier. the curtains were half drawn, and only admitted the
mysterious light calculated for beatific reveries. all the mundane
objects that generally strike the eye on entering the room of a young

that young man is a musketeer, had disappeared as
if by enchantment; and for fear, no doubt, that the sight of them might
bring his master back to ideas of this world, bazin had laid his hands
upon sword, pistols, plumed hat, and embroideries and laces of all kinds
and sorts. in their stead dâ€™artagnan thought he perceived in an obscure
corner a discipline cord suspended from a nail in the wall.

at the noise made by dâ€™artagnan in entering, aramis lifted up his head,
and beheld his friend; but to the great astonishment of the young man,
the sight of him did not produce much effect upon the musketeer, so
completely was his mind detached from the things of this world.

"good day, dear dâ€™artagnan," said aramis; "believe me, i am glad to see
you."

"so am i delighted to see you," said dâ€™artagnan, "although i am not yet
sure that it is aramis i am speaking to."

"to himself, my friend, to himself! but what makes you doubt it?"

"i was afr

aid i had made a mistake in the chamber, and that i had found
my way into the apartment of some churchman. then another error seized
me on seeing you in company with these gentlemen--i was afraid you were
dangerously ill."

the two men in black, who guessed dâ€™artagnanâ€™s meaning, darted at him a
glance which might have been thought threatening; but dâ€™artagnan took no
heed of it.

"i disturb you, perhaps, my dear aramis," continued dâ€™artagnan, "for by
what i see, i am led to believe that you are confessing to these
gentlemen."

aramis colored imperceptibly. "you disturb me? oh, quite the contrary,
dear friend, i swear; and as a proof of what i say, permit me to declare
i am rejoiced to see you safe and sound."

"ah, heâ€™ll come round," thought dâ€™artagnan; "thatâ€™s not bad!"

"this gentleman, who is my friend, has just escaped from a serious
danger," continued aramis, with unction, pointing to dâ€™artagna

hand, and addressing the two ecclesiastics.

"praise god, monsieur," replied they, bowing together.

"i have not failed to do so, your reverences," replied the young man,
returning their salutation.

"you arrive in good time, dear dâ€™artagnan," said aramis, "and by taking
part in our discussion may assist us with your intelligence. monsieur
the principal of amiens, monsieur the curate of montdidier, and i are
arguing certain theological questions in which we have been much
interested; i shall be delighted to have your opinion."

"the opinion of a swordsman can have very little weight," replied
dâ€™artagnan, who began to be uneasy at the turn things were taking, "and
you had better be satisfied, believe me, with the knowledge of these
gentlemen."

the two men in black bowed in their turn.

"on the contrary," replied aramis, "your opinion will be very valuable.
the question is this: monsieur the principal thinks that my thesis ought
to be dogmatic and didactic."

"your thesis! are you then making a thesis?"

"without doubt," replied the jesuit. "in the examination which precedes
ordination, a thesis is always a requisite."

"ordination!" cried dâ€™artagnan, who could not believe what the hostess
and bazin had successively told him; and he gazed, half stupefied, upon
the three persons before him.

"now," continued

aramis, taking the same graceful position in his easy
chair that he would have assumed in bed, and complacently examining his
hand, which was as white and plump as that of a woman, and which he held
in the air to cause the blood to descend, "now, as you have heard,
dâ€™artagnan, monsieur the principal is desirous that my thesis should be
dogmatic, while i, for my part, would rather it should be ideal. this is
the reason why monsieur the principal has proposed to me the following
subject, which has not
 
 ___________________________
 
 yet been treated upon, and in which i perceive
there is matter for magnificent elaboration-â€™utraque manus in
benedicendo clericis inferioribus necessaria est.â€™"

dâ€™artagnan, whose erudition we are well acquainted with, evinced no more
interest on hearing this quotation than he had at that of m. de treville
in allusion to the gifts he pretended that dâ€™artagnan had received from
the duke of buckingham.

"which means," resumed aramis, that he might perfectly understand, "â€™the
two hands are indispensable for priests of the inferior orders, when
they bestow the benediction.â€™"

"an admirable subject!" cried the jesuit.

"admirable and dogmatic!" repeated the curate, who, about as strong as
dâ€™artagnan with respect to latin, carefully watched the jesuit in order
to keep step with him, and repeated his words like an echo.

as to dâ€™artagnan, he remained perfectly insensible to the enthusiasm of
the two men in black.

"yes,

 admirable! prorsus admirabile!" continued aramis; "but which
requires a profound study of both the scriptures and the fathers. now, i
have confessed to these learned ecclesiastics, and that in all humility,
that the duties of mounting guard and the service of the king have
caused me to neglect study a little. i should find myself, therefore,
more at my ease, facilus natans, in a subject of my own choice, which
would be to these hard theological questions what morals are to
metaphysics in philosophy."

dâ€™artagnan began to be tired, and so di

d the curate.

"see what an exordium!" cried the jesuit.

"exordium," repeated the curate, for the sake of saying something.
"quemadmodum inter coelorum immnsitatem."

aramis cast a glance upon dâ€™artagnan to see what effect all this
produced, and found his friend gaping enough to split his jaws.

"let us speak french, my father," said he to the jesuit; "monsieur
dâ€™artagnan will enjoy our conversation better."

"yes," replied dâ€™artagnan; "i am fatigued with reading, and all this
latin confuses me."

"certainly," replied the jesuit, a little put out, while the curate,
greatly delighted, turned upon dâ€™artagnan a look full of gratitude.
"well, let us see what is

with the hands; he held out both his arms while the hebrews beat their
enemies, and then he blessed them with his two hands. besides, what does
the gospel say? imponite manus, and not manum-place the hands, not the
hand."

"place the hands," repeated the curate, with a gesture.

"st. peter, on the contrary, of whom the popes are the successors,"
continued the jesuit; "porrige digitos-present the fingers. are you
there, now?"

"certes," replied aramis, in a pleased tone, "but the thing is subtle."

"the fingers," resumed the jesuit, "st. peter blessed with the fingers.
the pope, therefore blesses with the fingers. and with how many fingers
does he bless? with three fingers, to be sure-one for the father, one
for the son, and one for the holy ghost."

all crossed themselves. dâ€™artagnan thought it was proper to follow this
example.

"the pope is the successor of st. peter, and represents the three divine
powers; the rest-ordines inferiores-o

bless in the name of the holy archangels and angels. the most humble
clerks such as our deacons and sacristans, bless with holy water
sprinklers, which resemble an infinite number of blessing fingers. there
is the subject simplified. argumentum omni denudatum ornamento. i could
make of that subject two volumes the size of this," continued the
jesuit; and in his enthusiasm he struck a st. chrysostom in folio, which
made the table bend beneath its weight.

dâ€™artagnan trembled.

"certes," said aramis, "i do justice to the beauties of this thesis; but
at the same time i perceive it would be overwhelming for me. i had
chosen this text-tell me, dear dâ€™artagnan, if it is not to your
taste-â€™non inutile est desiderium in oblationeâ€™; that is, â€™a little
regret is not unsuitable in an offering to the lord.â€™"

"stop there!" cried the jesuit, "for that thesis touches closely upon
heresy. there is a proposition almost like it in the augustinus of the
heresiarch jansenius, whose book will soon

er or later be burned by the
hands of the executioner. take care, my young friend. you are inclining
toward false doctrines, my young friend; you will be lost."

"you will be lost," said the curate, shaking his head sorrowfully.

"you approach that famous point of free will which is a mortal rock. you
face the insinuations of the pelagians and the semi-pelagians."

"but, my reverend-" replied aramis, a little amazed by the shower of
arguments that poured upon his head.

"how will you prove," continued the jesuit, without allowing him time to
speak, "that we ought to regret the world when we offer ourselves to
god? listen to this dilemma: god is god, and the world is the devil. to
regret the world is to regret the devil; that is my conclusion."

"and that is mine also," said the curate.

"but, for heavenâ€™s sake-" resumed aramis.

"desideras diabolum, unhappy man!" cried the jesuit.

"he r

egrets the devil! ah, my young friend," added the curate, groaning,
"do not regret the devil, i implore you!"

dâ€™artagnan felt himself bewildered. it seemed to him as though he were
in a madhouse, and was becoming as mad as those he saw. he was, however,
forced to hold his tongue from not comprehending half the language they
employed.

"but listen to me, then," resumed aramis with politeness mingled with a
little impatience. "i do not say i regret; no, i will never pronounce
that sentence, which would not be orthodox."

the jesuit raised his hands toward heaven, and the curate did the same.

"no; but pray grant me that it is acting with an ill grace to offer to
the lord only that with which we are perfectly disgusted! donâ€™t you
think so, dâ€™artagnan?"

"i think so, indeed," cried he.

the jesuit and the curate quite started from their chairs.

"this is the point

of departure; it is a syllogism. the world is not
wanting in attractions. i quit the world; then i make a sacrifice. now,
the scripture says positively, â€™make a sacrifice unto the lord.â€™"

"that is true," said his antagonists.

"and then," said aramis, pinching his ear to make it red, as he rubbed
his hands to make them white, "and then i made a certain rondeau upon it
last year, which i showed to monsieur voiture, and that great man paid
me a thousand compliments."

"a rondeau!" said the jesuit, disdainfully.

"a rondeau!" said the curate, mechanically.

"repeat it! repeat it!" cried dâ€™artagnan; "it will make a little
change."

"not so, for it is religious," replied aramis; "it is theology in
verse."

"the devil!" said dâ€™artagnan.

"her

e it is," said aramis, with a little look of diffidence, which,
however, was not exempt from a shade of hypocrisy:

"vous qui pleurez un passe plein de charmes, et qui trainez des jours
infortunes, tous vos malheurs se verront termines, quand a dieu seul
vous offrirez vos larmes, vous qui pleurez!"

"you who weep for pleasures fled, while dragging on a life of care, all
your woes will melt in air, if to god your tears are shed, you who
weep!"

dâ€™artagnan and the curate appeared pleased. the jesuit persisted in his

opinion. "beware of a profane taste in your theological style. what says
augustine on this subject: â€™severus sit clericorum verbo.â€™"

"yes, let the sermon be clear," said the curate.

"now," hastily interrupted the jesuit, on seeing that his acolyte was
going astray, "now your thesis would please the ladies; it would have
the success of one of monsieur patruâ€™s pleadings."

"please god!" cried aramis, transported.

"there it is," cried the jesuit; "the world still speaks within you in a
loud voice, altisimm voce. you follow the world, my young friend, and i
tremble lest grace prove not efficacious."

"be satisfied, my reverend father, i can answer for myself."

"mundane presumption!"

"i know myself, father; my resolution is irrevocable."

"then you persist in continuing that thesis?"

"i feel myself called upon to treat that, and no other. i will see about
the continuation of it, and tomor

"plague stifle you and your latin!" said dâ€™artagnan, who began to feel
all his patience exhausted.

"farewell, my son," said the curate, "till tomorrow."

"till tomorrow, rash youth," said the jesuit. "you promise to become one
of the lights of the church. heaven grant that this light prove not a
devouring fire!"

dâ€™artagnan, who for an hour past had been gnawing his nails with
impatience, was beginning to attack the quick.

the two men in black rose, bowed to aramis and dâ€™artagnan, and advanced
toward the door. bazin, who had been standing listening to all this
controversy with a pious jubilation, sprang toward them, took the
breviary of the curate and the missal of the jesuit, and walked
respectfully before them to clear their way.

aramis conducted them to the foot of the stairs, and then immediately
came up again to dâ€™artagnan, whose senses were still in a state of
confusion.

when left alone, the two friends at first kept an embarrassed silence.

 however became necessary for one of them to break it first, and as
dâ€™artagnan appeared determined to leave that honor to his companion,
aramis said, "you see that i am returned to my fundamental ideas."

"yes, efficacious grace has touched you, as that gentleman said just
now."

"oh, these plans of retreat have been formed for a long time. you have
often heard me speak of them, have you not, my friend?"

"yes; but i confess i always thought you jested."

"with such things! oh, dâ€™artagnan!"

"the devil! why, people jest with death."

"and people are wrong, dâ€™artagnan; for death is the door which leads to
perdition or to salvation."

"granted; but if you please, let us not theologize, aramis. you must
have had enough for today. as for me, i have almost forgotten the little
latin i have ever known. then i confess to you that i have eaten nothing
since ten oâ€™clock this morning, and i am devilish hungry."

"we will dine directly, my friend; only you must please to remember that
this is friday. now, on such a day i can neither eat flesh nor see it
eaten. if you can be satisfied with my dinner-it consists of cooked
tetragones and fruits."

"what do you mean by tetragones?" asked dâ€™a

rtagnan, uneasily.

"i mean spinach," replied aramis; "but on your account i will add some
eggs, and that is a serious infraction of the rule-for eggs are meat,
since they engender chickens."

"this feast is not very succulent; but never mind, i will put up with it
for the sake of remaining with you."

"i am grateful to you for the sacrifice," said aramis; "but if your body
be not greatly benefited by it, be assured your soul will."

"and so, aramis, you are decidedly going into the church? what will our
two friends say? what will monsieur de treville say? they will treat you
as a deserter, i warn you."

"i do not enter the church; i re-enter it. i deserted the church for the
world, for you know that i forced myself when i became a musketeer."

"i? i know nothing about it."

"you donâ€™t know i quit the seminary?"

"not at all."

"this is my story, then. besides, the scriptures say, â€™confess
yourselves to one another,â€™ and i confess to

upon it.â€™ â€™come,
then. ladies,â€™ said the officer, â€™do not disturb yourselves; allow me
time just to kill this gentleman, and i will return and finish the last

"we went out. i took him to the rue payenne, to exactly the same spot
where, a year before, at the very same hour, he had paid me the
compliment i have related to you. it was a superb moonlight night. we
immediately drew, and at the first pass i laid him stark dead."

"the devil!" cried dâ€™artagnan.

"now," continued aramis, "as the ladies did not see the singer come
back, and as he was found in the rue payenne with a great sword wound
through his body, it was supposed that i had accommodated him thus; and
the matter created some scandal which obliged me to renounce the cassock
for a time. athos, whose acquaintance i made about that period, and
porthos, who had in addition to my lessons taught me some effective
tricks of fence, prevailed upon me to solicit the uniform of a
musketeer. the king entertained great reg

ard for my father, who had
fallen at the siege of arras, and the uniform was granted. you may
understand that the moment has come for me to re-enter the bosom of the
church."

"and why today, rather than yesterday or tomorrow? what has happened to
you today, to raise all these melancholy ideas?"

"this wound, my dear dâ€™artagnan, has been a warning to me from heaven."

"this wound? bah, it is now nearly healed, and i am sure it is not that
which gives you the most pain."

"what, then?" said aramis, blushing.

"you have one at heart, aramis, one deeper and more painful--a wound
made by a woman."

the eye of aramis kindled in spite of himself.

"ah," said he, dissembling his emotion under a feigned carelessness, "do
not talk of such things, and suffer love pains? vanitas vanitatum!
according to your idea, then, my brain is turned. and for whom-for some
grisette, some chambermaid with whom i have trifled in some garrison?

"pardon, my dear aramis, but i thought you carried your eyes h

igher."

"higher? and who am i, to nourish such ambition? a poor musketeer, a
beggar, an unknown--who hates slavery, and finds himself ill-placed in
the world."

"aramis, aramis!" cried dâ€™artagnan, looking at his friend with an air of
doubt.

"dust i am, and to dust i return. life is full of humiliations and
sorrows," continued he, becoming still more melancholy; "all the ties
which attach him to life break in the hand of man, particularly the
golden ties. oh, my dear dâ€™artagnan," resumed aramis, giving to his
voice a slight tone of bitterness, "trust me! conceal your wounds when
you have any; silence is the last joy of the unhappy. beware of giving
anyone the clue to your griefs; the curious suck our tears as flies suck
the blood of a wounded hart."

"alas, my dear aramis," said dâ€™artagnan, in his turn heaving a profound
sigh, "that is my story you are relating!"

"how?"

"yes; a woman whom i love, whom i adore, has just been torn from me by
force. i do not know where she is or whit
 
 ___________________________
 
her they have conducted her.
she is perhaps a prisoner; she is perhaps dead!"

"yes, but you have at least this consolation, that you can say to
yourself she has not quit you voluntarily, that if you learn no news of
her, it is because all communication with you is interdicted; while i--"

"well?"

"nothing," replied aramis, "nothing."

"so you renounce the world, then, forever; that is a settled thing--a
resolution registered!"

"forever! you are my friend today; tomorrow you will be no more to me
than a shadow, or rather, even, you will no longer exist. as for the
world, it is a sepulcher and nothing else."

"the devil! all this is very sad which you tell me."

"what will you? my vocation commands me; it carries me away."

dâ€™artagnan smiled, but made no answer.

aramis continued, "and yet, while i do belong to
 
 ___________________________
 
 the earth, i wish to
speak of you--of our friends."

"and on my part," said dâ€™artagnan, "i wished to speak of you, but i find
you so completely detached from everything! to love you cry, â€™fie!
friends are shadows! the world is a sepulcher!â€™"

"alas, you will find it so yourself," said aramis, with a sigh.

"well, then, let us say no more about it," said dâ€™artagnan; "and let us
burn this letter, which, no doubt, announces to you some fresh
infidelity of your grisette or your chambermaid."

"what letter?" cried aramis, eagerly.

"a letter which was sent to your abode in your absence, and which was
given to me for you."

"but from whom is that letter?"

"oh, from some heartbroken waiting woman, some desponding grisette; from
madame de chevreuseâ€™s chambermaid, perhaps, who was obli

ged to return to
tours with her mistress, and who, in order to appear smart and
attractive, stole some perfumed paper, and sealed her letter with a
duchessâ€™s coronet."

"what do you say?"

"hold! i must have lost it," said the young man maliciously, pretending
to search for it. "but fortunately the world is a sepulcher; the men,
and consequently the women, are but shadows, and love is a sentiment to
which you cry, â€™fie! fie!â€™"

"dâ€™artagnan, dâ€™artagnan," cried aramis, "you are killing me!"

"well, here it is at last!" said dâ€™artagnan, as he drew the letter from
his pocket.

aramis made a bound, seized the letter, read it, or rather devoured it,
his countenance radiant.

"this same waiting maid seems to have an agreeable style," said the
messenger, carelessly.

"thanks, dâ€™artagnan, thanks!" cried aramis, almost in a state of
delirium. "she was forced to return to tours; she is not faithless; she
still loves me! come, my friend, come, let me embrace you.

almost stifles me!"

the two friends began to dance around the venerable st. chrysostom,
kicking about famously the sheets of the thesis, which had fallen on the
floor.

at that moment bazin entered with the spinach and the omelet.

"be off, you wretch!" cried aramis, throwing his skullcap in his face.
"return whence you came; take back those horrible vegetables, and that
poor kickshaw! order a larded hare, a fat capon, mutton leg dressed with
garlic, and four bottles of old burgundy."

bazin, who looked at his master, without comprehending the cause of this
change, in a melancholy manner, allowed the omelet to slip into the
spinach, and the spinach onto the floor.

"now this is the moment to consecrate your existence to the king of
kings," said dâ€™artagna

27 the wife of athos


we have now to search for athos," said dâ€™artagnan to the vivacious
aramis, when he had informed him of all that had passed since their
departure from the capital, and an excellent dinner had made one of them
forget his thesis and the other his fatigue.

"do you think, then, that any harm can have happened to him?" asked
aramis. "athos is so cool, so brave, and handles his sword so
skillfully."

"no doubt. nobody has a higher opinion of the courage and skill of athos
than i have; but i like better to hear my sword clang against lances
than against staves. i fear lest

athos should have been beaten down by
serving men. those fellows strike hard, and donâ€™t leave off in a hurry.
this is why i wish to set out again as soon as possible."

"i will try to accompany you," said aramis, "though i scarcely feel in a
condition to mount on horseback. yesterday i undertook to employ that
cord which you see hanging against the wall, but pain prevented my
continuing the pious exercise."

"thatâ€™s the first time i ever heard of anybody trying to cure gunshot
wounds with cat-oâ€™-nine-tails; but you were ill, and illness renders the
head weak, therefore you may be excused."

"when do you mean to set out?"

"tomorrow at daybreak. sleep as soundly as you can tonight, and
tomorrow, if 
 
 ___________________________
 
you can, we will take our departure together."

"till tomorrow, then," said aramis; "for iron-nerved as you are, you
must need repose."

the next morning, when dâ€™artagnan entered aramisâ€™s chamber, he found him
at the window.

"what are you looking at?" asked dâ€™artagnan.

"my faith! i am admiring three magnificent horses which the stable boys
are leading about. it would be a pleasure worthy of a prince to travel
upon such horses."

"well, my dear aramis, you may enjoy that pleasure, for one of those
three horses is yours."

"ah, bah! which?"

"whichever of the three you like, i have no preference."

"and the rich caparison, is that mine, too?"

"without doubt."

"you laugh, dâ€™artagnan."

"no, i have left off laughing, now that you speak french."

"what, those rich holsters, that velvet housing, that saddle studded
with silver-are they all for me?"

"for you and nobody else, as the horse which paws the ground is mine,
and the other horse, whi

partisan in hand. and monsieur de nogaret de la valette, what do you say
of him? he is a cardinal likewise. ask his lackey how often he has had
to prepare lint of him."

"alas!" sighed bazin. "i know it, monsieur; everything is turned
topsy-turvy in the world nowadays."

while this dialogue was going on, the two young men and the poor lackey
descended.

"hold my stirrup, bazin," cried aramis; and aramis sprang into the
saddle with his usual grace and agility, but after a few vaults and
curvets of the noble animal his rider felt his pains come on so
insupportably that he turned pale and became unsteady in his seat.
dâ€™artagnan, who, foreseeing such an event, had kept his eye on him,
sprang toward him, caught him in his arms, and assisted him to his
chamber.

"thatâ€™s all right, my dear aramis, take care of yourself," said he; "i
will go alone in search of athos."

"you are a man o

"no, i have good luck, that is all. but how do you mean to pass your
time till i come back? no more theses, no more glosses upon the fingers
or upon benedictions, hey?"

aramis smiled. "i will make verses," said he.

"yes, i dare say; verses perfumed with the odor of the billet from the
attendant of madame de chevreuse. teach bazin prosody; that will console
him. as to the horse, ride him a little every day, and that will
accustom you to his maneuvers."

"oh, make yourself easy on that head," replied aramis. "you will find me
ready to follow you."

they took leave of each other, and in ten minutes, after having
commended his friend to the cares of the hostess and bazi

s in his most cheerful days might advantageously sustain a
comparison. he was of middle height; but his person was so admirably
shaped and so well proportioned that more than once in his struggles
with porthos he had overcome the giant whose physical strength was
proverbial among the musketeers. his head, with piercing eyes, a
straight nose, a chin cut like that of brutus, had altogether an
indefinable character of grandeur and grace. his hands, of which he took
little care, were the despair of aramis, who cultivated his with almond
paste and perfumed oil. the sound of his voice was at once penetrating
and melodious; and then, that which was inconceivable in athos, who was
always retiring, was that delicate knowledge of the world and of the
usages of the most brilliant society--those manners of a high degree
which appeared, as if unconsciously to himself, in his least actions.

if a repast were on foot, athos presided over it better than any other,
placing every guest exactly in the rank whi

of the great land owners. he was profoundly versed in hunting and
falconry, and had one day when conversing on this great art astonished
even louis xiii himself, who took a pride in being considered a past
master therein.

like all the great nobles of that period, athos rode and fenced to
perfection. but still further, his education had been so little
neglected, even with respect to scholastic studies, so rare at this time
among gentlemen, that he smiled at the scraps of latin which aramis
sported and which porthos pretended to understand. two or three times,
even, to the great astonishment of his friends, he had, when aramis
allowed some rudimental error to escape him, replaced a verb in its
right tense and a noun in its case. besides, his probity was
irreproachable, in an age in which soldiers compromised so easily with
their religion and their consciences, lovers with the rigorous delicacy
of our era, and the poor with godâ€™s seventh commandment. this athos,

"why, this man is a cask!" said the host, aside. "if he only remains
here a fortnight, and pays for what he drinks, i shall soon re-establish
my business."

"and donâ€™t forget," said dâ€™artagnan, "to bring up four bottles of the
same sort for the two english gentlemen."

"and now," said athos, "while they bring the wine, tell me, dâ€™artagnan,
what has become of the others, come!"

dâ€™artagnan related how he had found porthos in bed with a strained knee,
and aramis at a table between two theologians. as he finished, the host
entered with the wine ordered and a ham which, fortunately for him, had
been left out of the cellar.

"thatâ€™s well!" said athos, filling his glass and that of his friend;
"hereâ€™s to porthos and aramis! but you, dâ€™artagnan, what is the matter
with you, and what has happened to you personally? you have a sad air."

"alas," said dâ€™artagnan, "it is because i am the most unfortunate."

"tell me."

"presently," said dâ€™artagnan.

paris."

"i am much attached to that horse, athos."

"and there again you are wrong. a horse slips and injures a joint; a
horse stumbles and breaks his knees to the bone; a horse eats out of a
manger in which a glandered horse has eaten. there is a horse, while on
the contrary, the hundred pistoles feed their master."

"but how shall we get back?"

"upon our lackeyâ€™s horses, pardieu. anybody may see by our bearing that
we are people of condition."

"pretty figures we shall cut on ponies while aramis and porthos caracole
on their steeds."

"aramis! porthos!" cried athos, and laughed aloud.

"what is it?" asked dâ€™artagnan, who did not at all comprehend the
hilarity of his friend.

"nothing, nothing! go on!"

"your advice, then?"

"to take the hundred pistoles, dâ€™artagnan. with the hundred pistoles we
can live well to the end of the month. we have undergone a great deal of
fatigue, remember, and a little rest will do no harm."

"i rest? oh, no, athos. once in paris, i shall prosecute my s

 acquiesced, therefore,
and chose the hundred pistoles, which the englishman paid down on the
spot.

they then determined to depart. peace with the landlord, in addition to
athosâ€™s old horse, cost six pistoles. dâ€™artagnan and athos took the nags
of planchet and grimaud, and the two lackeys started on foot, carrying
the saddles on their heads.

however ill our two friends were mounted, they were soon far in advance
of their servants, and arrived at creveccoeur. from a distance they
perceived aramis, seated in a melancholy manner at his window, looking
out, like sister anne, at the dust in the horizon.

"hola, aramis! what the devil are you doing there?" cried the two
friends.

"ah, is that you, dâ€™artagnan, and you, athos?" said the young man. "i
was reflecting upon the rapidity with which the blessings of this world
leave us. my english horse, which has just disappeared amid a cloud of
dust, has furnished me with a living image of the fragility of the
things of the earth. life itself ma

"which means--" said dâ€™artagnan, who began to suspect the truth.

"which means that i have just been duped-sixty louis for a horse which
by the manner of his gait can do at least five leagues an hour."

dâ€™artagnan and athos laughed aloud.

"my dear dâ€™artagnan," said aramis, "donâ€™t be too angry with me, i beg.
necessity has no law; besides, i am the person punished, as that
rascally horsedealer has robbed me of fifty louis, at least. ah, you
fellows are good managers! you ride on our lackeyâ€™s horses, and have
your own gallant steeds led along carefully by hand, at short stages."

at the same instant a market cart, which some minutes before had
appeared upon the amiens road, pulled up at the inn, and planchet and
grimaud came out of it with the saddles on their
 
 ___________________________
 
 heads. the cart was
returning empty to paris, and the two lackeys had agreed, for their
transport, to slake the wagonerâ€™s thirst along the route.

"what is this?" said aramis, on seeing them arrive. "nothing but
saddles?"

"now do you understand?" said athos.

"my friends, thatâ€™s exactly like me! i retained my harness by instinct.
hola, bazin! bring my new saddle and carry it along with those of these
gentlemen."

"and what have you done with your ecclesiastics?" asked dâ€™artagnan.

"my dear fellow, i invited them to a dinner the next day," replied
aramis. "they have some capital wine here--please to observe that in
passing. i did my best to make them drunk. then

 the curate forbade me to

"without a thesis?" cried dâ€™artagnan, "without a thesis? i demand the
suppression of the thesis."

"since then," continued aramis, "i have lived very agreeably. i have
begun a poem in verses of one syllable. that is rather difficult, but
the merit in all things consists in the difficulty. the matter is
gallant. i will read you the first canto. it has four hundred lines, and
lasts a minute."

"my faith, my dear aramis," said dâ€™artagnan, who detested verses almost
as much as he did latin, "add to the merit of the difficulty that of the
brevity, and you are sure that your poem will at least have two merits."

"you will see

," continued aramis, "that it breathes irreproachable
passion. and so, my friends, we return to paris? bravo! i am ready. we
are going to rejoin that good fellow, porthos. so much the better. you
canâ€™t think how i have missed him, the great simpleton. to see him so
self-satisfied reconciles me with myself. he would not sell his horse;
not for a kingdom! i think i can see him now, mounted upon his superb
animal and seated in his handsome saddle. i am sure he will look like
the great mogul!"

they made a halt for 
 
 ___________________________
 
an hour to refresh their horses. aramis discharged
his bill, placed bazin in the cart with his comrades, and they set
forward to join porthos.

they found him up, less pale than when dâ€™artagnan left him after his
first visit, and seated at a table on which, though he was alone, was
spread enough for four persons. this dinner consisted of meats nicely
dressed, choice wines, and superb fruit.

"ah, pardieu!" said he, rising, "you come in the nick of time,
gentlemen. i was just beginning the soup, and you will dine with me."

"oh, oh!

"i am recruiting myself," said porthos, "i am recruiting myself. nothing
weakens a man more than these devilish strains. did you ever suffer from
a strain, athos?"

"never! though i remember, in our affair of the rue ferou, i received a
sword wound which at the end of fifteen or eighteen days produced the
same effect."

"but this dinner was not intended for you alone, porthos?" said aramis.

"no," said porthos, "i expected some gentlemen of the neighborhood, who
have just sent me word they could not come. you will take their places
and i shall not lose by the exchange. hola, mousqueton, seats, and order
double the bottles!"

"do you know what we are eating here?" said athos, at the end of ten
minutes.

"pardieu!" replied dâ€™artagnan, "for my part, i am eating veal garnished
with shrimps and vegetables."

"and i some lamb chops," said porthos.

"and i a plain chicken," said arami

"you are all mistaken, gentlemen," answered athos, gravely; "you are
eating horse."

"eating what?" said dâ€™artagnan.

"horse!" said aramis, with a grimace of disgust.

porthos alone made no reply.

"yes, horse. are we not eating a horse, porthos? and perhaps his saddle,
therewith."

"no, gentlemen, i have kept the harness," said porthos.

"my faith," said aramis, "we are all alike. one would think we had
tipped the wink."

"what could i do?" said porthos. "this horse made my visitors ashamed of
theirs, and i donâ€™t like to humiliate people."

"then your duchess is still at the waters?" asked dâ€™artagnan.

"still," replied porthos. "and, my faith, the governor of the
province--one of the gentlemen i expected today--seemed to have such a
wish for him, that i gave him to him."

"gave him?" cried dâ€™artagnan.

"my god, yes, gave, that is the word," said

 porthos; "for the animal was
worth at least a hundred and fifty louis, and the stingy fellow would
only give me eighty."

"without the saddle?" said aramis.

"yes, without the saddle."

"you will observe, gentlemen," said athos, "that porthos has made the
best bargain of any of us."

and then commenced a roar of laughter in which they all joined, to the
astonishment of poor porthos; but when he was informed of the cause of
their hilarity, he shared it vociferously according to his custom.

"there is one comfort, we are all in cash," said dâ€™artagnan.

"well, for my part," said athos, "i found aramisâ€™s spanish wine so good
that i sent on a hampe

r of sixty bottles of it in the wagon with the
lackeys. that has weakened my purse."

"and i," said aramis, "imagined that i had given almost my last sou to
the church of montdidier and the jesuits of amiens, with whom i had made
engagements which i ought to have kept. i have ordered masses for
myself, and for you, gentlemen, which will be said, gentlemen, for which
i have not the least doubt you will be marvelously benefited."

"and i," said porthos, "do you think my strain cost me nothing?--without
reckoning mousquetonâ€™s wound, for which i had to have the surgeon twice
a day, and who charged me 
 
 ___________________________
 
double on account of that foolish mousqueton
having allowed himself a ball in a part which people generally only show
to an apothecary; so i advised him to try never to get wounded there any
more."

"ay, ay!" said athos, exchanging a smile with dâ€™artagnan and aramis, "it
is very clear you acted nobly with regard to the poor lad; that is like
a good master."

"in short," said porthos, "when all my expenses are paid, i shall have,
at most, thirty crowns left."

"and i about ten pistoles," said aramis.

"well, then it appears that we are the croesuses of the society. how
much have you left of your hundred pistoles, dâ€™artagnan?"

"of my hundred pistoles? why, in the first place i gave you fifty."

"you think so?"

"pardieu!" "ah, that is true. i recollect."

"then i paid the host six."

"what a brute of a host! why did you give him six pistoles?"

"you told me to give them to him."

"it is true; i am too good-natured. in brief, how much remains?"

"twenty-five pistoles," said dâ€™artagnan.

 
 ___________________________
 

"and i," said athos, taking some small change from his pocket, "i--"

"you? nothing!"

"my faith! so little that it is not worth reckoning with the general
stock."

"now, then, let us calculate how much we posses in all."

"porthos?"

"thirty crowns."

"aramis?"

"ten pistoles."

"and you, dâ€™artagnan?"

"twenty-five."

"that makes in all?" said athos.

"four hundred and seventy-five livres," said dâ€™artagnan, who reckoned
like archimedes.

"on our arrival in paris, we shall still have four hundred, besides the
harnesses," said porthos.

"but our troop horses?" said aramis.

"well, of the four horses of our lackeys we will make two for the
masters, for which we will draw lots. with the four hundred livres we
will make the half of one for one of the

ivres," said athos.

"it seems to me," said dâ€™artagnan, "with a thousand livres each--i do
not speak as a spartan, but as a procurator--"

this word procurator roused porthos. "stop," said he, "i have an idea."

"well, thatâ€™s something, for i have not the shadow of one," said athos
coolly; "but as to dâ€™artagnan, gentlemen, the idea of belonging to ours
has driven him out of his senses. a thousand livres! for my part, i
declare i want two thousand."

"four times two makes eight," then said aramis; "it is eight thousand
that we want to complete our outfits, toward which, it is true, we have
already the saddles."

"besides," said athos, waiting till dâ€™artagnan, who went to thank
monsieur de treville, had shut the door, "besides, there is that
beautiful ring which beams from the finger of our friend. what the
devil! dâ€™artagnan is too good a comrade to leave his brothers in
embarrassment while he wears the ransom of a king on his finger."

 good a catholic to kill myself with a
pistol bullet, i will seek a good quarrel with four of his eminenceâ€™s
guards or with eight englishmen, and i will fight until one of them has
killed me, which, considering the number, cannot fail to happen. it will
then be said of me that i died for the king; so that i shall have
performed my duty without the expense of an outfit."

porthos continued to walk about with his hands behind him, tossing his
head and repeating, "i shall follow up on my idea."

aramis, anxious and negligently dressed, said nothing.

it may be seen by these disastrous details that desolation reigned in
the community.

the lackeys on their part, like the coursers of hippolytus, shared the
sadness of their masters. mousqueton collected a store of crusts; bazin,
who had always been inclined to devotion, never quit the churches;
planchet watched the flight of flies; and grimaud, whom the general
distress could not induce to break the silence imposed by his master,
heaved sighs en
 
 ___________________________
 
with the spur, he cantered back to paris. as he was accustomed to
do in all cases of any consequence, dâ€™artagnan went straight to the
residence of athos.

he found athos reclining upon a large sofa, where he was waiting, as he
said, for his outfit to come and find him. he related to athos all that
had passed, except the letter to m. de wardes.

athos was delighted to find he was going to fight an englishman. we
might say that was his dream.

they immediately sent their lackeys for porthos and aramis, and on their
arrival made them acquainted with the situation.

porthos drew his sword from the scabbard, and made passes at the wall,
springing back from time to time, and making contortions like a dancer.

aramis, who was constantly at work at his poem, shut himself up in
athosâ€™s closet, and begged not to be disturbed before the moment of
drawing swords.

athos, by signs, desired grimaud to bring another bottle of wine.

dâ€™artagnan employed himself in arranging a little plan, of which we

s us a greater desire to know the real ones," replied
the englishman.

"you played very willingly with us without knowing our names," said
athos, "by the same token that you won our horses."

"that is true, but we then only risked our pistoles; this time we risk
our blood. one plays with anybody; but one fights only with equals."

"and that is but just," said athos, and he took aside the one of the
four englishmen with whom he was to fight, and communicated his name in
a low voice.

porthos and aramis did the same.

"does that satisfy you?" said athos to his adversary. "do you find me of
sufficient rank to do me the honor of crossing swords with me?"

"yes, monsieur," said the englishman, bowing.

"well! now shall i tell you something?" added athos, coolly.

"what?" replied the englishman.

"why, that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not
required me to make myself known."

"why so?"

"because i am believed to be dead, and have reasons for wishing nobody
to know i am l

their adversaries, "are we ready?"

"yes!" answered the englishmen and the frenchmen, as with one voice.

"on guard, then!" cried athos.

immediately eight swords glittered in the rays of the setting sun, and
the combat began with an animosity very natural between men twice
enemies.

athos fenced with as much calmness and method as if he had been
practicing in a fencing school.

porthos, abated, no doubt, of his too-great confidence by his adventure
of chantilly, played with skill and prudence. aramis, who had the third
canto of his poem to finish, behaved like a man in haste.

athos killed his adversary first. he hit him but once, but as he had
foretold, that hit was a mortal one; the sword pierced his heart.

second, porthos stretched his upon the grass with a wound through his
thigh. as the englishman, without making any further resistance, then
surrendered his sword, porthos took him up in his arms and bore him to
his carriage.

aramis pushed his so vigorously that after going back fifty

dâ€™artagnan was at the height of joy; he had realized the plan he had
imagined beforehand, whose picturing had produced the smiles we noted
upon his face.

the englishman, delighted at having to do with a gentleman of such a
kind disposition, pressed dâ€™artagnan in his arms, and paid a thousand
compliments to the three musketeers, and as porthosâ€™s adversary was
already installed in the carriage, and as aramisâ€™s had taken to his
heels, they had nothing to think about but the dead.

as porthos and aramis were undressing him, in the hope of finding his
wound not mortal, a large purse dropped from his clothes. dâ€™artagnan
picked it up and offered it to lord de winter.

"what the devil would you have me do with that?" said the englishman.

"you can restore it to his family," said dâ€™artagnan.

"his family will care much about such a trifle as that! his family will
inherit fifteen thousand louis a yea

gn of assent.

at this time athos came up to dâ€™artagnan.

"what do you mean to do with that purse?" whispered he.

"why, i meant to pass it over to you, my dear athos."

"me! why to me?"

"why, you killed him! they are the spoils of victory."

"i, the heir of an enemy!" said athos; "for whom, then, do you take me?"

"it is the custom in war," said dâ€™artagnan, "why should it not be the
custom in a duel?"

"even on the field of battle, i have never done that."

porthos shrugged his shoulders; aramis by a movement of his lips
endorsed athos.

"then," said dâ€™artagnan, "let us give the money to the lackeys, as lord
de winter desired us to do."

"yes," said athos; "let us give the money to the lackeys--not to our
lackeys, but to the lackeys of the englishmen."

athos took the purse, and threw it into the hand of the coachman. "for
you and your comrades."

this greatness of spirit in a man who was quite destitute struck even
porthos; and this french generosity, repeated by lord de winter and

dâ€™artagnan replied in such a manner that kitty remained in her great
delusion. although she cried freely before deciding to transmit the
letter to her mistress, she did at last so decide, which was all
dâ€™artagnan wished. finally he promised that he would leave her
mistressâ€™s presence at an early hour that evening, and that when he left
the mistress he would ascend with the maid. this promise completed poor
kittyâ€™s consolation.




34 in which the equipment of aramis and porthos is treated of


since the four friends had been each in search of his equipments, there
had been no fixed meeting between them. they dined apart from one
another, wherever they might happen to be, or rather where they could.
duty likewise on its part took a portion of that precious time which was
gliding away so rapidly--only they had agreed to meet once a week, about
one oâ€™clock, at the residence of athos, seeing that he, in agreement
with the vow he had formed, did not pass over
 
 ___________________________
 
 the threshold of his door.

this day of reunion was the same day as that on which kitty came to find
dâ€™artagnan. soon as kitty left him, dâ€™artagnan directed his steps toward
the rue ferou.

he found athos and aramis philosophizing. aramis had some slight
inclination to resume the cassock. athos, according to his system,
neither encouraged nor dissuaded him. athos believed that everyone
should be left to his own free will. he never gave advice but when it
was asked, and even then he required to be asked twice.

"people, in general," he said, "only ask advice not to follow it; or if
they do follow it, it is for the sake of having someone to blame for
having given it."

porthos arrived a minute after dâ€™artagnan. the four friends 
 
 ___________________________
 
were
reunited.

the four countenances expressed four different feelings: that of
porthos, tranquillity; that of dâ€™artagnan, hope; that of aramis,
uneasiness; that of athos, carelessness.

at the end of a momentâ€™s conversation, in which porthos hinted that a
lady of elevated rank had condescended to relieve him from his
embarrassment, mousqueton entered. he came to request his master to
return to his lodgings, where his presence was urgent, as he piteously
said.

"is it my equipment?"

"yes and no," replied mousqueton.

"well, but canâ€™t you speak?"

"come, monsieur."

porthos rose, saluted his friends, and followed mousqueton. an ins

after, bazin made his appearance at the door.

"what do you want with me, my friend?" said aramis, with that mildness
of language which was observable in him every time that his ideas were
directed toward the church.

"a man wishes to see monsieur at home," replied bazin.

"a man! what man?"

"a mendicant."

"give him alms, bazin, and bid him pray for a poor sinner."

"this mendicant insists upon speaking to you, and pretends that you will
be very glad to see him."

"has he sent no particular message for me?"

"yes. if monsieur aramis hesitates to come," he said, "tell him i am
from tours."
 
 ___________________________
 


"from tours!" cried aramis. "a thousand pardons, gentlemen; but no doubt
this man brings me the news i expected." and rising also, he went off at
a quick pace. there remained athos and dâ€™artagnan.

"i believe these fellows have managed their business. what do you think,
dâ€™artagnan?" said athos.

"i know that porthos was in a fair way," replied dâ€™artagnan; "and as to
aramis to tell you the truth, i have never been seriously uneasy on his
account. but you, my dear athos--you, who so generously distributed the
englishmanâ€™s pistoles, which were our legitimate property--what do you
mean to do?"

"i am satisfied with having killed that fellow, my boy, seeing that it
is blessed bread to kill an englishman; but if i had pocketed his
pistoles, they would have weighed me down like a remorse."

"go to, my dear athos; you have truly inconceivable ideas."

"let it pass. wha

n the point of telling athos all; but one consideration
restrained him. athos was a gentleman, punctilious in points of honor;
and there were in the plan which our lover had devised for milady, he
was sure, certain things that would not obtain the assent of this
puritan. he was therefore silent; and as athos was the least inquisitive
of any man on earth, dâ€™artagnanâ€™s confidence stopped there. we will
therefore leave the two friends, who had nothing important to say to
each other, and follow aramis.

upon being informed that the person who wanted to speak to him came from
tours, we have seen with what rapidity the young man followed, or rather
went before, bazin; he ran without stopping from the rue ferou to the
rue de vaugirard. on entering he found a man of short stature and
intelligent eyes, but covered with rags.

"you have asked for me?" said the musketeer.

"i wish to speak with monsieur aramis. is that your name, monsieur?"

"my very own. you have brought me something?"

"yes, if y

"here it is," said aramis, taking a small key from his breast and
opening a little ebony box inlaid with mother of pearl, "here it is.
look."

"that is right," replied the mendicant; "dismiss your lackey."

in fact, bazin, curious to know what the mendicant could want with his
master, kept pace with him as well as he could, and arrived almost at
the same time he did; but his quickness was not of much use to him. at
the hint from the mendicant his master made him a sign to retire, and he
was obliged to obey.

bazin gone,

 the mendicant cast a rapid glance around him in order to be
sure that nobody could either see or hear him, and opening his ragged
vest, badly held together by a leather strap, he began to rip the upper
part of his doublet, from which he drew a letter.

aramis uttered a cry of joy at the sight of the seal, kissed the
superscription with an almost religious respect, and opened the epistle,
which contained what follows:

"my friend, it is the will of fate that we should be still for some time
separated; but the delightful days of youth are not lost beyond return.
perform your duty in camp; i will do mine elsewhere. accept that which
the bearer brings you; make the campaign like a handsome true gentleman,
and think of me, who kisses tenderly your black

eyes.

"adieu; or rather, au revoir."

the mendicant continued to rip his garments; and drew from amid his rags
a hundred and fifty spanish double pistoles, which he laid down on the
table; then he opened the door, bowed, and went out before the young
man, stupefied by his letter, had ventured to address a word to him.

aramis then reperused the letter, and perceived a postscript:

ps. you may behave politely to the bearer, who is a count and a grandee
of spain!

"golden dreams!" cried aramis. "oh, beautiful life! yes, we are young;
yes, we shall yet have happy days! my love, my blood, my life! all, all,
all, are thine, my adored mistress!"

and he kissed the letter with passion, without even vouchsafing a look
at the gold which sparkled on the table.

bazin scratched at the door, and as aramis had no longer any reason to
exclude him, he bade him come in.

bazin was stupefied at the sight of the gold, and forgot that he came to
announce dâ€™artagnan, who, curious to know who the men
 
 ___________________________
 
dicant could be,
came to aramis on leaving athos.

now, as dâ€™artagnan used no ceremony with aramis, seeing that bazin
forgot to announce him, he announced himself.

"the devil! my dear aramis," said dâ€™artagnan, "if these are the prunes
that are sent to you from tours, i beg you will make my compliments to
the gardener who gathers them."

"you are mistaken, friend dâ€™artagnan," said aramis, always on his guard;
"this is from my publisher, who has just sent me the price of that poem
in one-syllable verse which i began yonder."

"ah, indeed," said dâ€™artagnan. "well, your publisher is very generous,
my dear aramis, thatâ€™s all i can say."

"how, monsieur?" cried bazin, "a poem sell so dear as that! it is
incredible! oh, monsieur, you can write as much as you like; you may
become equal to monsieur de voiture and monsieur de benserade. i like
that. a poet is as good as an abbe. ah!
 
 ___________________________
 
 monsieur aramis, become a poet,
i beg of you."

"bazin, my friend," said aramis, "i believe you meddle with my
conversation."

bazin perceived he was wrong; he bowed and went out.

"ah!" said dâ€™artagnan with a smile, "you sell your productions at their
weight in gold. you are very fortunate, my friend; but take care or you
will lose that letter which is peeping from your doublet, and which also
comes, no doubt, from your publisher."

aramis blushed to the eyes, crammed in the letter, and re-buttoned his
doublet.

"my dear dâ€™artagnan," said he, "if you please, we will join our friends;
as i am rich, we will today begin to dine together again, expecting that
you will be rich in your turn."

"my faith!" said dâ€™artagnan, with great pleasure. "it is long since we
have had a good dinner; and i, for my part, have a somewhat hazardous
expedition for this evening, and shall not be sorry, i confess, to
fortify myself with a few glasses 
 
 ___________________________
 
of good old burgundy."

"agreed, as to the old burgundy; i have no objection to that," said
aramis, from whom the letter and the gold had removed, as by magic, his
ideas of conversion.

and having put three or four double pistoles into his pocket to answer
the needs of the moment, he placed the others in the ebony box, inlaid
with mother of pearl, in which was the famous handkerchief which served
him as a talisman.

the two friends repaired to athosâ€™s, and he, faithful to his vow of not
going out, took upon him to order dinner to be brought to them. as he
was perfectly acquainted with the 
 
 ___________________________
 
details of gastronomy, dâ€™artagnan and
aramis made no objection to abandoning this important care to him.

they went to find porthos, and at the corner of the rue bac met
mousqueton, who, with a most pitiable air, was driving before him a mule
and a horse.

dâ€™artagnan uttered a cry of surprise, which was not quite free from joy.

"ah, my yellow horse," cried he. "aramis, look at that horse!"

"oh, the frightful brute!" said aramis.

"ah, my dear," replied dâ€™artagnan, "upon that very horse i came to
paris."

"what, does monsieur know this horse?" said mousqueton.

"it is of an original color," said aramis; "i never saw one with such a
hide in my life."

"i can well believe it," replied dâ€™artagnan, "and that was why i got
three crowns for him. it must have been for his hide, for, certes, the
carcass is not worth eighteen livres. but how did this horse come into
your hands, mousqueton?"

"pray," said the lackey, "say no

the neighborhood to whom this horse and mule belonged.

mme. coquenard recognized her present, and could not at first comprehend
this restitution; but the visit of porthos soon enlightened her. the
anger which fired the eyes of the musketeer, in spite of his efforts to
suppress it, terrified his sensitive inamorata. in fact, mousqueton had
not concealed from his master that he had met dâ€™artagnan and aramis, and
that dâ€™artagnan in the yellow horse had recognized the bearnese pony
upon which he had come to paris, and which he had sold for three crowns.

porthos went away after having appointed a meeting with the procuratorâ€™s
wife in the cloister of st. magloire. the procurator, seeing he was
going, invited him to dinner--an invitation which the musketeer refused
with a majestic air.

mme. coquenard repaired trembling to the cloister of st. magloire, for

"do what you please, monsieur chevalier. help me out of paris; help me
out of france!"

"i cannot take you, however, to the siege of la rochelle," aid
dâ€™artagnan.

"no; but you can place me in one of the provinces with some lady of your
acquaintance--in your own country, for instance."

"my dear little love! in my country the ladies do without chambermaids.
but stop! i can manage your business for you. planchet, go and find
aramis. request him to come here directly. we have something very
important to say to him."

"i understand," said athos; "but why not porthos? i should have thought
that his duchess--"

"oh, porthosâ€™s duchess is dressed by her husbandâ€™s clerks," said
dâ€™artagnan, laughing. "besides, kitty would not like to live in the rue
aux ours. isnâ€™t it so, kitty?"

"i do not care where i live," said kitty, "provided i am well concealed,
and nobody knows where i am."

"meanwhile, kitty, when we are about to

"i pulled down my hood as soon as i saw him, but perhaps it was too
late."

"go down, athos--he mistrusts you less than me--and see if he be still
at his door."

athos went down and returned immediately.

"he has gone," said he, "and the house door is shut."

"he has gone to make his report, and to say that all the pigeons are at
this moment in the dovecot."

"well, then, let us all fly," said athos, "and leave nobody here but
planchet to bring us news."

"a minute. aramis, whom we have sent for!"

"thatâ€™s true," said athos; "we must wait for aramis."

at that moment aramis entered.

the matter was all explained to him, and the friends gave him to
understand that among all his high connections he must find a place for
kitty.

aramis reflected for a minute, and then said, coloring, "will it be
really rendering you a service, dâ€™artagnan?"

"i shall be grateful to you all my life."

"very well. madame de bois-tracy asked me, for one of her friends who

my dear dâ€™artagnan, answer for mademoiselle-"

"oh, monsieur, be assured that i shall be entirely devoted to the person
who will give me the means of quitting paris."

"then," said aramis, "this falls out very well."

he placed himself at the table and wrote a little note which he sealed
with a ring, and gave the billet to kitty.

"and now, my dear girl," said dâ€™artagnan, "you know that it is not good
for any of us to be here. therefore let us separate. we shall meet again
in better days."

"and whenever we find each other, in whatever place it may be," said
kitty, "you will find me loving you as i love you today."

"dicersâ€™ oaths!" said athos, while dâ€™artagnan went to con

an instant afterward the three young men separated, agreeing to meet
again at four oâ€™clock with athos, and leaving planchet to guard the
house.

aramis returned home, and athos and dâ€™artagnan busied themselves about
pledging the sapphire.

as the gascon had foreseen, they easily obtained three hundred pistoles
on the ring. still further, the jew told them that if they would sell it
to him, as it would make a magnificent pendant for earrings, he would
give five hundred pistoles for it.

athos and dâ€™artagnan, with the activity of two soldiers and the
knowledge of two connoisseurs, hardly required three hours to purchase

"and yet," replied dâ€™artagnan, "i think i recognize the writing."

"it may be counterfeit," said athos. "between six and seven oâ€™clock the
road of chaillot is quite deserted; you might as well go and ride in the
forest of bondy."

"but suppose we all go," said dâ€™artagnan; "what the devil! they wonâ€™t
devour us all four, four lackeys, horses, arms, and all!"

"and besides, it will be a chance for displaying our new equipments,"
said porthos.

"but if it is a woman who writes," said aramis, "and that woman desires
not to be seen, remember, you compromise her, dâ€™artagnan; which is not
the part of a gentleman."

"we will remain in the background," said porthos, "and he will advance
alone."

"yes; but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a
gallop."

"bah!" said dâ€™artagnan, "they will miss me; if they fire we will ride
after the carriage, and exterminate those who may be in it. they must be
enemies."

"he is right," said porthos; "battle. besides, we must t

"bah, let us enjoy that pleasure," said aramis, with his mild and
careless manner.

"as you please," said athos.

"gentlemen," said dâ€™artagnan, "it is half past four, and we have
scarcely time to be on the road of chaillot by six."

"besides, if we go out too late, nobody will see us," said porthos, "and
that will be a pity. let us get ready, gentlemen."

"but this second letter," said athos, "you forget that; it appears to
me, however, that the seal denotes that it deserves to be opened. for my
part, i declare, dâ€™artagnan, i think it o

s," and dâ€™artagnan unsealed the letter and read,

"m. dâ€™artagnan, of the kingâ€™s guards, company dessessart, is expected at
the palais-cardinal this evening, at eight oâ€™clock.

"la houdiniere, captain of the guards"

"the devil!" said athos; "hereâ€™s a rendezvous much more serious than the
other."

"i will go to the second after attending the first," said dâ€™artagnan.
"one is for seven oâ€™clock, and the other for eight; there will be time
for both."

"hum! i would not go at all," said aramis. "a gallant knight cannot
decline a rendezvous with a lady; but a prudent gentleman may excuse
himself from not waiting on his eminence, particularly when he has
reason to believe he is not invited to make his compliments."

"i am of aramisâ€™s opinion," said porthos.

"gentlemen," replied dâ€™artagnan, "i have already received by monsieur de
cavois a similar invitation from his eminence. i neglected it, and on
the morrow a serious misfortune happened to me--constance disappeared.
whatever may

ensue, i will go."

"if you are determined," said athos, "do so."

"but the bastille?" said aramis.

"bah! you will get me out if they put me there," said dâ€™artagnan.

"to be sure we will," replied aramis and porthos, with admirable
promptness and decision, as if that were the simplest thing in the
world, "to be sure we will get you out; but meantime, as we are to set
off the day after tomorrow, you would do much better not to risk this
bastille."

"let us do better than that," said athos; "do not let us leave him
during the whole evening. let each of us wait at a gate of the palace
with three musketeers behind him; if we see a close carriage, at all
suspicious in appearance, come out, let us fa

time since we have had a skirmish with the guards of monsieur the

"to a certainty, athos," said aramis, "you were meant to be a general of
the army! what do you think of the plan, gentlemen?"

"admirable!" replied the young men in chorus.

"well," said porthos, "i will run to the hotel, and engage our comrades
to hold themselves in readiness by eight oâ€™clock; the rendezvous, the
place du palais-cardinal. meantime, you see that the lackeys saddle the
horses."

"i have no horse," said dâ€™artagnan; "but that is of no consequence, i
can take one of monsieur de trevilleâ€™s."

"that is not worth w

hile," said aramis, "you can have one of mine."

"one of yours! how many have you, then?" asked dâ€™artagnan.

"three," replied aramis, smiling.

"certes," cried athos, "you are the best-mounted poet of france or
navarre."

"well, my dear aramis, you donâ€™t want three horses? i cannot comprehend
what induced you to buy three!"

"therefore i only purchased two," said aramis.

"the third, then, fell from the clouds, i suppose?"

"no, the third was brought to me this very morning by a groom out of
livery, who would not tell me in whose service he was, and who said he
had received orders from his master."

"or his mistress," interrupted dâ€™artagnan.

"that makes no difference," said aramis, coloring; "and who affirmed, as
i said, that he had received orders from his master or mistress to place
the horse in my stable, without informing me whence it came."

"it is onl

almost always upon the goodness of his horse."

"well, transfer it to me at the price it cost you?"

"i was going to make you the offer, my dear dâ€™artagnan, giving you all
the time necessary for repaying me such a trifle."

"how much did it cost you?"

"eight hundred livres."

"here are forty double pistoles, my dear friend," said dâ€™artagnan,
taking the sum from his pocket; "i know that is the coin in which you
were paid for your poems."

"you are rich, then?" said aramis.

"rich? richest, my dear fellow!"

and dâ€™artagnan chinked the remainder of his pistoles in his pocket.

"send your saddle, then, to the hotel of the musketeers, and your horse
can be brought back with ours."

"very well; but it is already five oâ€™clock, so make haste."

a quarter of an hour afterward porthos appeared at the end of the rue
ferou on a very handsome genet. mousqueton followed him upon an auvergne
horse, small but very handsome. porthos was resplendent with joy and
pride.

at t

he same time, aramis made his appearance at the other end of the
street upon a superb english charger. bazin followed him upon a roan,
holding by the halter a vigorous mecklenburg horse; this was
dâ€™artagnanâ€™s mount.

the two musketeers met at the gate. athos and dâ€™artagnan watched their
approach from the window.

"the devil!" cried aramis, "you have a magnificent horse there,
porthos."

"yes," replied porthos, "it is the one that ought to have been sent to
me at first. a bad joke of the husbandâ€™s substituted the other; but the
husband has been punished since, and i have obtained full satisfaction."

planchet and grimaud appeared in their turn, leading their mastersâ€™
steeds. dâ€™artagnan and athos put themselves into saddle with their
companions, and all four set forward; athos upon a horse he owed to a
woman, aramis on a hor

musketeers, in which it was known he would one day take his place; he
was considered beforehand as a comrade. it resulted from these
antecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which
they met; besides, it would not be unlikely that they would have an
opportunity of playing either the cardinal or his people an ill turn,
and for such expeditions these worthy gentlemen were always ready.

athos divided them into three groups, assumed the command of one, gave
the second to aramis, and the third to porthos; and then each group went
and took their watch near an entrance.

dâ€™artagnan, on his part, entered boldly at the principal gate.

although he felt himself ably supported, the young man was not without a
little uneasiness as he ascended the great staircase, step by step. his
conduct toward milady bore a strong resemblance to treachery, and he was
very suspicious of the political relations which existed between that
woman and the cardinal. still further, de wardes, who

it was this fear that restrained him, so powerful is the influence of a
truly great character on all that surrounds it.

dâ€™artagnan descended by the staircase at which he had entered, and found
athos and the four musketeers waiting his appearance, and beginning to
grow uneasy. with a word, dâ€™artagnan reassured them; and planchet ran to
inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer, as
his master had come out safe from the palais-cardinal.

returned home with athos, aramis and porthos inquired eagerly the cause
of the strange interview; but dâ€™artagnan confined himself to telling
them that m. de richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter
into his guards with the rank of ensign, and that he had refused.

"and you were right," cried aramis and porthos, with one voice.

athos fell into a profound reverie and answered nothing. but when they
were alone he said, "you have done that which you ought to have done,
dâ€™artagnan; but perhaps you have been wrong.

band.

but the real adieux were made in mme. coquenardâ€™s chamber; they were
heartrending.

as long as the procuratorâ€™s wife could follow him with her eyes, she
waved her handkerchief to him, leaning so far out of the window as to
lead people to believe she wished to precipitate herself. porthos
received all these attentions like a man accustomed to such
demonstrations, only on turning the corner of the street he lifted his
hat gracefully, and waved it to her as a sign of adieu.

on his part aramis wrote a long letter. to whom? nobody knew. kitty, who
was to set out that evening for tours, was waiting in the next chamber.

athos sipped the last bottle of his spanish wine.

in the meantime dâ€™artagnan was defiling with his company. arriving at
the faubourg st. antoine, he turned round to look gaily at the bastille;
but as it was the bastille alone he looked at, he did not observe
milady, who, mounted upon a light chestnut horse, designated him with
her finger to two ill-looking men who ca

 follow as soon as his bed of justice
had been held; but on rising from his bed of justice on the
twenty-eighth of june, he felt himself attacked by fever. he was,
notwithstanding, anxious to set out; but his illness becoming more
serious, he was forced to stop at villeroy.

now, whenever the king halted, the musketeers halted. it followed that
dâ€™artagnan, who was as yet purely and simply in the guards, found
himself, for the time at least, separated from his good friends--athos,
porthos, and aramis. this separation, which was no more than an
unpleasant circumstance, would have certainly become a cause of serious
uneasiness if he had been able to guess by what unknown dangers he was
surrounded.

he, however, arrived without accident in the camp established before la
rochelle, on the tenth of the month of september of the year 1627.

everything was in the same state. the duke of buckingham and his
english, masters of the isle of re, continued to besiege, but without
success, the citadel st.

side the french were besieging la rochelle.

dâ€™artagnan, as we have said, had become more tranquil, as always happens
after a past danger, particularly when the danger seems to have
vanished. he only felt one uneasiness, and that was at not hearing any
tidings from his friends.

but one morning at the commencement of the month of november everything
was explained to him by this letter, dated from villeroy:

m dâ€™artagnan,

mm athos, porthos, and aramis, after having had an entertainment at my
house and enjoying themselves very much, created such a disturbance that
the provost of the castle, a rigid man, has ordered them to be confined
for some days; but i accomplish the order they have given me by
forwarding to you a dozen bottles of my anjou wine, with which they are
much pleased. they are desirous that you should drink to their health in
their favorite wine. i have done this, and am, monsieur, with great
respect,

the ceremony of reception over, the four friends were soon in one
anotherâ€™s arms.

"pardieu!" cried dâ€™artagnan, "you could not have arrived in better time;
the dinner cannot have had time to get cold! can it, gentlemen?" added
the young man, turning to the two guards, whom he introduced to his
friends.

"ah, ah!" said porthos, "it appears we are feasting!"

"i hope," said aramis, "there are no women at your dinner."

"is there any drinkable wine in your tavern?" asked athos.

"well, pardieu! there is yours, my dear friend," replied dâ€™artagnan.

"our wine!" said athos, astonished.

"yes, that you sent me."

"we sent you wine?"

"you know very well--the wine from the hills of anjou."

"yes, i know what brand you are talking about."

"the wine you prefer."

"well, in the absence of champagne and chambertin, you must content
yourselves with that."

"and so, connoisseurs

in wine as we are, we have sent you some anjou
wine?" said porthos.

"not exactly, it is the wine that was sent by your order."

"on our account?" said the three musketeers.

"did you send this wine, aramis?" said athos.

"no; and you, porthos?"

"no; and you, athos?"

"no!"

"if it was not you, it was your purveyor," said dâ€™artagnan.

"our purveyor!"

"yes, your purveyor, godeau--the purveyor of the musketeers."

"my faith! never mind where it comes from," said porthos, "let us taste
it, and if it is good, let us drink it."

"no," said athos; "donâ€™t let us drink wine which comes from an unknown
source."

"you are right, athos," said dâ€™artagnan. "did none of you charge your
purveyor, godeau,
 
 ___________________________
 
 to send me some wine?"

"no! and yet you say he has sent you some as from us?"

"here is his letter," said dâ€™artagnan, and he presented the note to his
comrades.

"this is not his writing!" said athos. "i am acquainted with it; before
we left villeroy i settled the accounts of the regiment."

"a false letter altogether," said porthos, "we have not been
disciplined."

"dâ€™artagnan," said aramis, in a reproachful tone, "how could you believe
that we had made a disturbance?"

dâ€™artagnan grew pale, and a convulsive trembling shook all his limbs.

"thou alarmest me!" said athos, who never used thee and thou but upon
very particular occasions, "what has happened?"

"look you, my friends!" cried dâ€™artagnan, "a horrible suspicion crosses
my mind! can this be another vengeance of that woman?"

it was now athos who turned pale.

dâ€™artagnan rushed toward the refreshment room, the three mu

"oh, but god is above! god will punish you! my god, grant that he may

"upon the gospel," said dâ€™artagnan, throwing himself down by the dying
man, "i swear to you that the wine was poisoned and that i was going to
drink of it as you did."

"i do not believe you," cried the soldier, and he expired amid horrible
tortures.

"frightful! frightful!" murmured athos, while porthos broke the bottles
and aramis gave orders, a little too late, that a confessor should be
sent for.

"oh, my friends," said dâ€™artagnan, "you come once more to save my life,
not only mine but that of these gentlemen. gentlemen," continued he,
addressing the guardsmen, "i request you will be silent with regard to
this adventure. great personages may have had a hand in what you have
seen, and if talked about, the evil would only recoil upon us."

"ah, monsieur!" stammered planchet, more dead than alive, "ah, monsieur,

"planchet," said dâ€™artagnan, "i commit the corpse of this poor devil to
your care. let him be interred in holy ground. he committed a crime, it
is true; but he repented of it."

and the four friends quit the room, leaving to planchet and fourreau the
duty of paying mortuary honors to brisemont.

the host gave them another chamber, and served them with fresh eggs and
some water, which athos went himself to draw at the fountain. in a few
words, porthos and aramis were posted as to the situation.

"well," said dâ€™artagnan to athos, "you see, my dear friend, that this is
war to the death."

athos shook his head.

"yes, yes," replied he, "i perceive that plainly; but do you really
believe it is she?"

"i am sure of it."

"nevertheless, i confess i still doubt."

"but the fleur-de-lis on her shoulder?"

"she is some englishwoman who has committed a crime in france, and has
been branded in consequence."

"athos, she is your wife, i tell you," repeated dâ€™a

"yes; but to wait surrounded by assassins and poisoners."

"bah!" said athos. "god has preserved us hitherto, god will preserve us

"yes, we. besides, we are men; and everything considered, it is our lot
to risk our lives; but she," asked he, in an undertone.

"what she?" asked athos.

"constance."

"madame bonacieux! ah, thatâ€™s true!" said athos. "my poor friend, i had
forgotten you were in love."

"well, but," said aramis, "have you not learned by the letter you found
on the wretched corpse that she is in a convent? one may be very
comfortable in a convent; and as soon as the siege of la rochelle is
terminated, i promise you on my part--"

"good," cried athos, "good! yes, my dear aramis, we all know that your
views have a religious tendency."

"i am only temporarily a musketeer," said aramis, humbly.

"it is some time since we heard from his mistress," said athos, in a low
voice. "but take no notice; we know all

"thatâ€™s true," said porthos.

"but i think i have it," said athos. "donâ€™t you say, dear dâ€™artagnan,
that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her?"

"i believe so, at least."

"in that case porthos will assist us."

"and how so, if you please?"

"why, by your marchioness, your duchess, your princess. she must have a
long arm."

"hush!" said porthos, placing a finger on his lips. "i believe her to be
a cardinalist; she must know nothing of the matter."

"then," said aramis, "i take upon myself to obtain intelligence of her."

"you, aramis?" cried the three friends. "you! and how?"

"by the queenâ€™s almoner, to whom i am very intimately allied," said
aramis, coloring.

and on this assurance, the four friends, who had finished their modest
repast, separated, with the promise of meeting again that evening.
dâ€™artagnan returned to less important affairs, and the three musketeers
repaired to the kingâ€™s quarters, where they had to prepare their
lodging.

interview with a messenger whom he did not wish to see at home.

on their part the musketeers, who had not much to do with the siege,
were not under very strict orders and led a joyous life. this was the
more easy for our three companions in particular; for being friends of
m. de treville, they obtained from him special permission to be absent
after the closing of the camp.

now, one evening when dâ€™artagnan, who was in the trenches, was not able
to accompany them, athos, porthos, and aramis, mounted on their battle
steeds, enveloped in their war cloaks, with their hands upon their
pistol butts, were returning from a drinking place called the red
dovecot, which athos had discovered two days before upon the route to
jarrie, following the road which led to the camp and quite on their
guard, as we have stated, for fear of an ambuscade, when, about a
quarter of a league from the village of boisnau, they fancied they heard
the sound of horses approaching them. they immediately all three

said athos, more and more convinced that he who
interrogated them had the right to do so.

"what company?"

"company of treville."

"advance, and give an account of what you are doing here at this hour."

the three companions advanced rather humbly--for all were now convinced
that they had to do with someone more powerful than themselves--leaving
athos the post of speaker.

one of the two riders, he who had spoken second, was ten paces in front
of his companion. athos made a sign to porthos and aramis also to remain
in the rear, and advanced alone.

"your pardon, my officer," said athos; "but we were ignorant with whom
we had to do, and you may see that we were keeping good guard."

"your name?" said the officer, who covered a part of his face with his
cloak.

"but yourself, monsieur," said athos, who began to be annoyed by this
inquisition, "give me, i beg you, the proof that you have the right to
question me."

"your name?" repeated the cavalier a second time, letting his cloak
fall, and l

be certain they will tell nobody."

"we are gentlemen, monseigneur," said athos; "require our parole, and
give yourself no uneasiness. thank god, we can keep a secret."

the cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous speaker.

"you have a quick ear, monsieur athos," said the cardinal; "but now
listen to this. it is not from mistrust that i request you to follow me,
but for my security. your companions are no doubt messieurs porthos and
aramis."

"yes, your eminence," said athos, while the two musketeers who had
remained behind advanced hat in hand.

"i know you, gentlemen," said the cardinal, "i know you. i know you are
not quite my friends, and i am sorry you are not so; but i know you are
brave and loyal gentlemen, and that confidence may be placed in you.
monsieur athos, do me, then, the honor to accompany me; you and your two
friends, and then i shall have an escort to excite envy in his majesty,
if we should meet him."

ave seen several ill-looking faces on the road, and we
have even had a quarrel at the red dovecot with four of those faces."

"a quarrel, and what for, gentlemen?" said the cardinal; "you know i
donâ€™t like quarrelers."

"and that is the reason why i have the honor to inform your eminence of
what has happened; for you might learn it from others, and upon a false
account believe us to be in fault."

"what have been the results of your quarrel?" said the cardinal,
knitting his brow.

"my friend, aramis, here, has received a slight sword wound in the arm,
but not enough to prevent him, as your eminence may see, from mounting
to the assault tomorrow, if your eminence orders an escalade."

"but you are not the men to allow sword wounds to be inflicted upon you
thus," said the cardinal. "come, be frank, gentlemen, you have settled
accounts with somebody! confess; you know i have the right of giving
absolution."

"i, monseigneur?" said athos. "i did not even draw my sword, but i took

and gave one of those brigands such a blow that i believe his shoulder
is broken."

"very well," said the cardinal; "and you, monsieur aramis?"

"monseigneur, being of a very mild disposition, and being, likewise, of
which monseigneur perhaps is not aware, about to enter into orders, i
endeavored to appease my comrades, when one of these wretches gave me a
wound with a sword, treacherously, across my left arm. then i admit my
patience failed me; i drew my sword in my turn, and as he came back to
the charge, i fancied i felt that in throwing himself upon me, he let it

it was evident that without suspecting it, and actuated solely by their
chivalrous and adventurous character, our three friends had just
rendered a service to someone the cardinal honored with his special
protection.

now, who was that someone? that was the question the three musketeers
put to one another. then, seeing that none of their replies could throw
any light on the subject, porthos called the host and asked for dice.

porthos and aramis placed themselves at the table and began to play.
athos walked about in a contemplative mood.

while thinking and walking, athos passed and repassed before the pipe of
the stove, broken in halves, the other extremity passing into the
chamber above; and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur
of words, which at length fixed his attention. athos went close to it,
and distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an interest
that he made a sign to his friends to be silent, r

 i donâ€™t prevent you from listening,
but i must be gone."

"you must be gone!" said porthos; "and if the cardinal asks for you,
what answer can we make?"

"you will not wait till he asks; you will speak first, and tell him that
i am gone on the lookout, because certain expressions of our host have
given me reason to think the road is not safe. i will say two words
about it to the cardinalâ€™s esquire likewise. the rest concerns myself;
donâ€™t be uneasy about that."

"be prudent, athos," said aramis.

"be easy on that head," replied athos; "you know i am cool enough."

porthos and aramis resumed their places by the stovepipe.

as to athos, he went out without any mystery, took his horse, which was
tied with those of his friends to the fastenings of the shutters, in
four words convinced the attendant of the necessity of a vanguard for
their return, carefully examined the priming of his pistols, drew his
sword, and took, like a forlorn hope, the road to the camp.

 athos had foreseen, it was not long before the cardinal came down. he
opened the door of the room in which the musketeers were, and found
porthos playing an earnest game of dice with aramis. he cast a rapid
glance around the room, and perceived that one of his men was missing.

"what has become of monseigneur athos?" asked he.

"monseigneur," replied porthos, "he has gone as a scout, on account of
some words of our host, which made him believe the road was not safe."

"and you, what have you done, monsieur porthos?"

"i have won five pistoles of aramis."

"well; now will you return with me?"

"we are at your eminenceâ€™s orders."

"to horse, then, gentlemen; for it is getting late

"yes, monseigneur," said porthos, "it is he."

"monsieur athos," said richelieu, "receive my thanks for the good guard
you have kept. gentlemen, we are arrived; take the gate on the left. the
watchword is, â€™king and re.â€™"

saying these words, the cardinal saluted the three friends with an
inclination of his head, and took the right hand, followed by his
attendant--for that night he himself slept in the camp.

"well!" said porthos and aramis together, as soon as the cardinal was
out of hearing, "well, he signed the paper she required!"

"i know it," said athos, coolly, "since here it is."

and the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached
their quarters, except to give the watchword to the sentinels. only they
sent mousqueton to tell planchet that his master was requested, the
instant that he left the trenches, to come to the quarters of the
musketeers.

nine, the vessel, which with letters of marque from the cardinal was
supposed to be sailing for bayonne, raised anchor, and steered its
course toward england.




46 the bastion saint-gervais


on arriving at the lodgings of his three friends, dâ€™artagnan found them
assembled in the same chamber. athos was meditating; porthos was
twisting his mustache; aramis was saying his prayers in a charming
little book of hours, bound in blue velvet.

"pardieu, gentlemen," said he. "i hope what you have to tell me is worth
the trouble, or else, i warn you, i will not pardon you for making me
come here instead of getting a little rest after a night spent in taking
and dismantling a bastion. ah, why were you not there, gentlemen? it was
warm work."

"we were in a place where it was not very cold," replied porthos, giving
his mustache a twist which was peculiar to

 him.

"hush!" said athos.

"oh, oh!" said dâ€™artagnan, comprehending the slight frown of the
musketeer. "it appears there is something fresh aboard."

"aramis," said athos, "you went to breakfast the day before yesterday at
the inn of the parpaillot, i believe?"

"yes."

"how did you fare?"

"for my part, i ate but little. the day before yesterday was a fish day,
and they had nothing but meat."

"what," said athos, "no fish at a seaport?"

"they say," said aramis, resuming his pious reading, "that the dyke
which the cardinal is making drives them all out into the open sea."

"but that is not quite what i mean to ask you, aramis," replied athos.
"i want to know if you were left alone, and nobody interrupted you."

"why, i think there were not many intruders. yes, athos, i know what you
mean: we shall do very well at the parpaillot."

"let us go to the parpaillot, then, for here the walls are like sheets
of paper."

dâ€™artagnan, who was accustomed to his

 friendâ€™s manner of acting, and who
perceived immediately, by a word, a gesture, or a sign from him, that
the circumstances were serious, took athosâ€™s arm, and went out without
saying anything. porthos followed, chatting with aramis.

on their way they met grimaud. athos made him a sign to come with them.
grimaud, according to custom, obeyed in silence; the poor lad had nearly
come to the pass of forgetting how to speak.

they arrived at the drinking room of the parpaillot. it was seven
oâ€™clock in the morning, and daylight began to appear. the three friends
ordered breakfast, and went into a room in which the host said they
would not be disturbed.

unfortunately, the hour was badly chosen for a private conference. the

not lose a drop of the fat of this estimable bird."

"you was right," said the swiss; "goose grease is kood with basdry."

"there!" said the dragoon. "now for the wager! we listen, monsieur
athos."

"yes, the wager!" said the light-horseman.

"well, monsieur de busigny, i will bet you," said athos, "that my three
companions, messieurs porthos, aramis, and dâ€™artagnan, and myself, will
go and breakfast in the bastion st. gervais, and we will remain there an
hour, by the watch, whatever the enemy may do to dislodge us."

porthos and aramis looked at each other; they began to comprehend.

"but," said dâ€™artagnan, in the ear of athos, "you are going to get us
all killed without mercy."

"we are much more likely to be killed," said athos, "if we do not go."

ng you. here at least," said athos, pointing to the
bastion, "they will not come and disturb us."

"it appears to me," said dâ€™artagnan, with that prudence which allied
itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery, "that we could have
found some retired place on the downs or the seashore."

"where we should have been seen all four conferring together, so that at
the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by
his spies that we were holding a council."

"yes," said aramis, "athos is right: animadvertuntur in desertis."

"a desert would not have been amiss," said porthos; "but it behooved us
to find it."

"there is no desert where a bird cannot pass over oneâ€™s head, where a
fish cannot leap out of the water, where a rabbit cannot come out of its
burrow, and i believe that bird, fish, and rabbit each becomes a spy of
the cardinal. better, then, pursue our enterprise; from which, besides,
we cannot retreat without shame. we have made a wager--a wager which

rd what dâ€™artagnan said?"

"what did he say?" demanded porthos.

"dâ€™artagnan said that in the attack of last night eight or ten frenchmen
were killed, and as many rochellais."

"what then?"

"the bodies were not plundered, were they? it appears the conquerors had
something else to do."

"well?"

"well, we shall find their muskets, their cartridges, and their flasks;
and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls, we shall have fifteen
guns and a hundred charges to fire."

"oh, athos!" said aramis, "truly you are a great man."

porthos nodded in sign of agreement. dâ€™artagnan alone did not seem
convinced.

grimaud no doubt shared the misgivings of the young man, for seeing that
they continued to advance toward the bastion--something he had till then
doubted--he pulled his master by the skirt of his coat.

"where are we going?" asked he, by a gesture.

athos pointed to the bastion.

"but," said grimaud, in the same silent dialect, "we shall leave our
skins there."

athos raised his eyes

ld throw them into the ditch," said porthos, "after having
assured ourselves they have nothing in their pockets."

"yes," said athos, "thatâ€™s grimaudâ€™s business."

"well, then," cried dâ€™artagnan, "pray let grimaud search them and throw
them over the walls."

"heaven forfend!" said athos; "they may serve us."

"these bodies serve us?" said porthos. "you are mad, dear friend."

"judge not rashly, say the gospel and the cardinal," replied athos. "how
many guns, gentlemen?"

"twelve," replied aramis.

"how many shots?"

"a hundred."

"thatâ€™s quite as many as we shall want. let us load the guns."

the four musketeers went to work; and as they were loading the last
musket grimaud announced that the breakfast was ready.

athos replied, always by gestures, that that was well, and indicated to
grimaud, by pointing to a turret that resembled a pepper caster, that he
was to stand as sentinel. only, to alleviate the tediousness of the
duty, athos allowed him to take a loaf, two cutlets, and a bo

charming woman, who entertained kind views toward our friend dâ€™artagnan,
who, on his part, has given her some offense for which she tried to
revenge herself a month ago by having him killed by two musket shots, a
week ago by trying to poison him, and yesterday by demanding his head of
the cardinal."

"what! by demanding my head of the cardinal?" cried dâ€™artagnan, pale
with terror.

"yes, that is true as the gospel," said porthos; "i heard her with my
own ears."

"i also," said aramis.

"then," said dâ€™artagnan, letting his arm fall with discouragement, "it
is useless to struggle longer. i may as well blow my brains out, and all
will be over."

"thatâ€™s the last folly to be committed," said athos, "seeing it is the
only one for which there is no remedy."

"but i can never escape," said dâ€™artagnan, "with such enemies. first, my
stranger of meung; then de wardes, to whom i have given three sword
wounds; next milady, whose secret i have discovered; finally, the

have to do with a very different number of people. what is it, grimaud?
considering the gravity of the occasion, i permit you to speak, my
friend; but be laconic, i beg. what do you see?"

"a troop."

"of how many persons?"

"twenty men."

"what sort of men?"

"sixteen pioneers, four soldiers."

"how far distant?"

"five hundred paces."

"good! we have just time to finish this fowl and to drink one glass of
wine to your health, dâ€™artagnan."

"to your health!" repeated porthos and aramis.

"well, then, to my health! although i am very much afraid that your good
wishes will not be of great service to me."

"bah!" said athos, "god is great, as say the followers of mohammed, and
the future is in his hands."

then, swallowing the contents of his glass, which he put down close to
him, athos arose carelessly, took the musket next to him, and drew near
to one of the loopholes.

porthos, aramis and dâ€™artagnan followed his example. as to grimaud, he
received orders to place himself be

eapons.

"pardieu!" said athos, "it was hardly worth while to distribute
ourselves for twenty fellows armed with pickaxes, mattocks, and shovels.
grimaud had only to make them a sign to go away, and i am convinced they
would have left us in peace."

"i doubt that," replied dâ€™artagnan, "for they are advancing very
resolutely. besides, in addition to the pioneers, there are four
soldiers and a brigadier, armed with muskets."

"thatâ€™s because they donâ€™t see us," said athos.

"my faith," said aramis, "i must confess i feel a great repugnance to
fire on these poor devils of civilians."

"he is a bad priest," said porthos, "who has pity for heretics."

"in truth," said athos, "aramis is right. i will warn them."

"what the devil are you going to do?" cried dâ€™artagnan, "you will be
shot."

but athos heeded not his advice. mounting on the breach, with his musket
in one hand and his hat in the other, he said, bowing courteously and
addressing the soldiers and the pioneers, who, astonished at

e is our friend."

"the duke is english; the duke fights against us. let her do what she
likes with the duke; i care no more about him than an empty bottle." and
athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had
poured the last drop into his glass.

"a moment," said dâ€™artagnan. "i will not abandon buckingham thus. he
gave us some very fine horses."

"and moreover, very handsome saddles," said porthos, who at the moment
wore on his cloak the lace of his own.

"besides," said aramis, "god desires the conversion and not the death of
a sinner."

"amen!" said athos, "and we will return to that subject later, if such
be your pleasure; but what for the moment engaged my attention most
earnestly, and i am sure you will understand me, dâ€™artagnan, was the
getting from this woman a kind of carte blanche which she had extorted
from the cardinal, and by means of which she could with impunity get rid
of you and perhaps of us."

"but this creature must be a demon!" said porthos, hold

ing out his plate
to aramis, who was cutting up a fowl.

"and this carte blanche," said dâ€™artagnan, "this carte blanche, does it
remain in her hands?"

"no, it passed into mine; i will not say without trouble, for if i did i
should tell a lie."

"my dear athos, i shall no longer count the number of times i am
indebted to you for my life."

"then it was to go to her that you left us?" said aramis.

"exactly."

"and you have that letter of the cardinal?" said dâ€™artagnan.

"here it is," said athos; and he took the invaluable paper from the
pocket of his uniform. dâ€™artagnan unfolded it with one hand, whose
trembling he did not even attempt to conceal, to read:

"dec. 3, 1627

"it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this
has done what he has done.

"in fact," said aramis, "it is an absolution according to rule."

"that paper must be torn to piece

s," said dâ€™artagnan, who fancied he
read in it his sentence of death.

"on the contrary," said athos, "it must be preserved carefully. i would
not give up this paper if covered with as many gold pieces."

"and what will she do now?" asked the young man.

"why," replied athos, carelessly, "she is probably going to write to the
cardinal that a damned musketeer, named athos, has taken her
safe-conduct from her by force; she will advise him in the same letter
to get rid of his two friends, aramis and porthos, at the same time. the
cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often
crossed his path; and then some fine morning he will arrest dâ€™artagnan,
and for fear he should feel lonely, he will send us to keep him company
in the bastille."

"go to! it appears to me you make dull jokes, my dear," said porthos.

"i do not jest," said athos.

"do you know," said porthos, "that to twist that damned miladyâ€™s neck
would be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor dev

huguenots, who have committed no other crime than singing in french the
psalms we sing in latin?"

"what says the abbe?" asked athos, quietly.

"i say i am entirely of porthosâ€™s opinion," replied aramis.

"and i, too," said dâ€™artagnan.

"fortunately, she is far off," said porthos, "for i confess she would
worry me if she were here."

"she worries me in england as well as in france," said athos.

"she worries me everywhere," said dâ€™artagnan.

"but when you held her in your power, why did you not drown her,
strangle her, hang her?" said porthos. "it is only the dead who do not
return."

"you think so, porthos?" replied the musketeer, with a sad smile which
dâ€™artagnan alone understood.

 muskets.

this time a small troop advanced, consisting of from twenty to
twenty-five men; but they were not pioneers, they were soldiers of the
garrison.

"shall we return to the camp?" said porthos. "i donâ€™t think the sides
are equal."

"impossible, for three reasons," replied athos. "the first, that we have
not finished breakfast; the second, that we still have some very
important things to say; and the third, that it yet wants ten minutes
before the lapse of the hour."

"well, then," said aramis, "we must form a plan of battle."

"thatâ€™s very simple," replied athos. "as soon as the enemy are within
musket shot, we must fire upon them. if they continue to advance, we
must fire again. we must fire as long as we have loaded guns. if those
who remain of the troop persist in coming to the assault, we will allow
the besiegers to get as far as the ditch, and then we will push down
upon their heads that strip of wall which keeps its perpendicular by a
miracle."

"bravo!" cried porthos. "deci

dedly, athos, you were born to be a
general, and the cardinal, who fancies himself a great soldier, is
nothing beside you."

"gentlemen," said athos, "no divided attention, i beg; let each one pick
out his man."

"i cover mine," said dâ€™artagnan.

"and i mine," said porthos.

"and i mine," said aramis.

"fire, then," said athos.

the four muskets made but one report, but four men fell.

the drum immediately beat, and the little troop advanced at charging
pace.

then the shots were repeated without regularity, but always aimed with
the same accuracy. nevertheless, as if they had been aware of the
numerical weakness of the friends, the rochellais continued to advance
in quick time.

with every three shots at least two men fell; but the march of those who
remained was not slackened.

time; i will go and find buckingham."

"you shall not do that, dâ€™artagnan," said athos, coolly.

"and why not? have i not been there once?"

"yes; but at that period we were not at war. at that period buckingham
was an ally, and not an enemy. what you would now do amounts to
treason."

dâ€™artagnan perceived the force of this reasoning, and was silent.

"but," said porthos, "i think i have an idea, in my turn."

"silence for monsieur porthosâ€™s idea!" said aramis.

"i will ask leave of absence of monsieur de treville, on some pretext or
other which you must invent; i am not very clever at pretexts. milady
does not know me; i will get access to her without her suspecting me,
and when i catch my beauty, i will strangle her."

"well," replied athos, "i am not far from approving the idea of monsieur
porthos."

"for shame!" said aramis. "kill a woman? no, listen to me; i have the
true idea."

"let us see your idea, aramis," said athos, who felt much deferenc

"we must inform the queen."

"ah, my faith, yes!" said porthos and dâ€™artagnan, at the same time; "we
are coming nearer to it now."

"inform the queen!" said athos; "and how? have we relations with the
court? could we send anyone to paris without its being known in the
camp? from here to paris it is a hundred and forty leagues; before our
letter was at angers we should be in a dungeon."

"as to remitting a letter with safety to her majesty," said aramis,
coloring, "i will take that upon myself. i know a clever person at
tours--"

aramis stopped on seeing athos smile.

"well, do you not adopt this means, athos?" said dâ€™artagnan.

"i do not reject it altogether," said athos; "but i wish to remind
aramis that he cannot quit the camp, and that nobody but one of
ourselves is trustworthy; that two hours after the messenger has set
out, all the capuchins, all the police, all the black caps of the
cardinal, will know your letter by heart, and you an

"tell us."

"allow me to give grimaud some indispensable orders."

athos made a sign for his lackey to approach.

"grimaud," said athos, pointing to the bodies which lay under the wall
of the bastion, "take those gentlemen, set them up against the wall, put
their hats upon their heads, and their guns in their hands."

"oh, the great man!" cried dâ€™artagnan. "i comprehend now."

"you comprehend?" said porthos.

"and do you comprehend, grimaud?" said aramis.

grimaud made a sign in the affirmative.

"thatâ€™s all that is necessary," said athos; "now for my idea."

"i should like, however, to comprehend," said porthos.

"that is useless."

"yes, yes! athosâ€™s idea!" cried aramis and dâ€™artagnan, at the same time.

"this milady, this woman, this creature, this demon, has a
brother-in-law, as i think you told me, dâ€™artagnan?"

"yes, i know him very well; and i also believe that he has not a very
warm affection for his sister-in-law."

"there is n

better," replied athos.

"in that case we are as well off as we wish."

"and yet," said porthos, "i would like to know what grimaud is about."

"silence, porthos!" said aramis.

"what is her brother-in-lawâ€™s name?"

"lord de winter."

"where is he now?"

"he returned to london at the first sound of war."

"well, thereâ€™s just the man we want," said athos. "it is he whom we must
warn. we will have him informed that his sister-in-law is on the point
of having someone assassinated, and beg him not to lose sight of her.
there is in london, i hope, some establishment like that of the
magdalens, or of the repentant daughters. he must place his sister in

"yes," said dâ€™artagnan, "till she comes out."

"ah, my faith!" said athos, "you require too much, dâ€™artagnan. i have

bottom of my sack."

"but i think it would be still better," said aramis, "to inform the
queen and lord de winter at the same time."

"yes; but who is to carry the letter to tours, and who to london?"

"i answer for bazin," said aramis.

"and i for planchet," said dâ€™artagnan.

"ay," said porthos, "if we cannot leave the camp, our lackeys may."

"to be sure they may; and this very day we will write the letters," said
aramis. "give the lackeys money, and they will start."

"we will give them money?" replied athos. "have you any money?"

the four friends looked at one another, and a cloud came over the brows
which but lately had been so cheerful.

which he had set up in the most picturesque attitudes. some carried
arms, others seemed to be taking aim, and the remainder appeared merely
to be sword in hand.

"bravo!" said athos; "that does honor to your imagination."

"all very well," said porthos, "but i should like to understand."

"let us decamp first, and you will understand afterward."

"a moment, gentlemen, a moment; give grimaud time to clear away the
breakfast."

"ah, ah!" said aramis, "the black points and the red points are visibly
enlarging. i am of dâ€™artagnanâ€™s opinion; we have no time to lose in
regaining our camp."

"my faith," said athos, "i have nothing to say against a retreat. we bet
upon one hour, and we have stayed an hour and a half. nothing can be
said; let us be off, gentlemen, let us be off!"

grimaud was already ahead, with the basket and the dessert. the four
friends followed, ten paces behind him.

"have you forgotten anything?" said aramis.

"the white flag, morbleu! we must not leave a flag in the hands of the
enemy, even if that flag be but a napkin."

and athos ran back to the bastion, mounted the platform, and bore off
the flag; but as the rochellais had arrived within musket range, they
opened a terrible fire upon this man, who appeared to expose himself for
pleasureâ€™s sake.

but athos might be said to bear a charmed life. the balls passed and
whistled all around him; not one struck him.

athos waved his flag, turning his

and inflexible personage felt the anxiety of a parent for the young man.

"only grazed a little," replied dâ€™artagnan; "my fingers were caught
between two stones--that of the wall and that of my ring--and the skin
was broken."

"that comes of wearing diamonds, my master," said athos, disdainfully.

"ah, to be sure," cried porthos, "there is a diamond. why the devil,
then, do we plague ourselves about money, when there is a diamond?"

"stop a bit!" said aramis.

"well thought of, porthos; this time you have an idea."

"undoubtedly," said porthos, drawing himself up at athosâ€™s compliment;
"as there is a diamond, let us sell it."

"but," said dâ€™artagnan, "it is the queenâ€™s diamond."

"the stronger reason why it should be sold," replied athos. "the queen
saving monsieur de buckingham, her lover; nothing more just. the queen
saving us, her friends; nothing more moral. let us sell the diamond.
what says monsieur the abbe? i donâ€™t ask porthos; his

opinion has been
given."

"why, i think," said aramis, blushing as usual, "that his ring not
coming from a mistress, and consequently not being a love token,
dâ€™artagnan may sell it."

"my dear aramis, you speak like theology personified. your advice, then,
is--"

"to sell the diamond," replied aramis.

"well, then," said dâ€™artagnan, gaily, "let us sell the diamond, and say
no more about it."

the fusillade continued; but the four friends were out of reach, and the
rochellais only fired to appease their consciences.

"my faith, it was time that idea came into porthosâ€™s head. here we are
at the camp; therefore, gentlemen, not a word more of this affair. we
are observed; they are coming to meet us. we shall be carried in
triumph."

in fact, as we have said, the whole camp was in motion. mo

"well?" asked the cardinal, on seeing la houdiniere return.

"well, monseigneur," replied the latter, "three musketeers and a
guardsman laid a wager with monsieur de busigny that they would go and
breakfast in the bastion st. gervais; and while breakfasting they held
it for two hours against the enemy, and have killed i donâ€™t know how
many rochellais."

"did you inquire the names of those three musketeers?"

"yes, monseigneur."

"what are their names?"

"messieurs athos, porthos, and aramis."

"still my three brave fellows!" murmured the cardinal. "and the
guardsman?"

"dâ€™artagnan."

"still my young scapegrace. positively, these four men must be on my
side."

the same evening the cardinal spoke to m. de treville of the exploit of
the morning, which was the talk of the whole camp. m. de treville, who
had received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes
of it, related it in all its details to his eminence, not forgetting the
episode of the napkin.

the next day, m. dessessartâ€™s valet came to dâ€™artagnanâ€™s lodging, and
gave him a bag containing seven thousand livres.

this was the price of the queenâ€™s diamond.




48 a family affair


athos had invented the phrase, family affair. a family affair was not
subject to the investigation of the cardinal; a family affair concerned
nobody. people might employ themselves in a family affair before all the
world. therefore athos had invented the phrase, family affair.

aramis had discovered the idea, the lackeys.

porthos had discovered the means, the diamond.

dâ€™artagnan alone had discovered nothing--he, ordinarily the most
inventive of the four; but it must be also said that the very name of
milady paralyzed him.

ah! no, we were mistaken; he had discovered a purchaser for his diamond.

the breakfast at m. de trevilleâ€™s was as gay and cheerful as possible.
dâ€™artagnan already wore his uniform--for being nearly of the same size
as aramis, and as aramis was so

mp.

in the evening, at the appointed hour, the four friends met. there only
remained three things to decide--what they should write to miladyâ€™s
brother; what they should write to the clever person at tours; and which
should be the lackeys to carry the letters.

everyone offered his own. athos talked of the discretion of grimaud, who
never spoke a word but when his master unlocked his mouth. porthos
boasted of the strength of mousqueton, who was big enough to thrash four
men of ordinary size. aramis, confiding in the address of bazin, made a
pompous eulogium on his candidate. finally, dâ€™artagnan had entire faith
in the bravery of planchet, and reminded them of the manner in which he
had conducted himself in the ticklish affair of boulogne.

these four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time, and gave
birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they
should be deemed too long.

"unfortunately," said athos, "he whom we send must possess in himself
alone the fo

ur qualities united."

"but where is such a lackey to be found?"

"not to be found!" cried athos. "i know it well, so take grimaud."

"take mousqueton."

"take bazin."

"take planchet. planchet is brave and shrewd; they are two qualities out
of the four."

"gentlemen," said aramis, "the principal question is not to know which
of our four lackeys is the most discreet, the most strong, the most
clever, or the most brave; the principal thing is to know which loves
money the best."

"what aramis says is very sensible," replied athos; "we must speculate
upon the faults of people, and not upon their virtues. monsieur abbe,
you are a great moralist."

"doubtless," said aramis, "for we not only require to be well served in
order to succeed, but moreover, not to fail; for in case of failure,
heads are in question, not for our lackeys--"

"speak lower, aramis," said athos.

"thatâ€™s wise--not for the lackeys," resumed aramis, "but for the
master--for the masters, we may say. are our lackeys

hame! thatâ€™s unworthy. a man
of spirit is not to be reminded of such services. a benefit reproached
is an offense committed."

"the devil!" said dâ€™artagnan, "you are insupportable. if the letter must
be written under your censure, my faith, i renounce the task."

"and you will do right. handle the musket and the sword, my dear fellow.
you will come off splendidly at those two exercises; but pass the pen
over to monsieur abbe. thatâ€™s his province."

"ay, ay!" said porthos; "pass the pen to aramis, who writes theses in
latin."

"well, so be it," said dâ€™artagnan. "draw up this note for us, aramis;
but by our holy father the pope, cut it short, for i shall prune you in
my turn, i warn you."

"i ask no better," said aramis, with that ingenious air of confidence
which every poet has in himself; "but let me be properly acquainted with
the subject. i have heard here and there that this sister-in-law was a
hussy. i have obtained proof of it by listening to her conversation with
the cardinal."

"lower! sacre bleu!" said athos.

"but," continued aramis, "the details escape me."

"and me also," said porthos.

dâ€™artagnan and athos looked at each other for some time in silence. at
length athos, after serious reflection and becoming more pale than
usual, made a sign of assent to dâ€™artagnan, who by it understood he was
at liberty to speak.

"well, this is what you have to say," said dâ€™artagnan: "my lord, your
sister-in-law is an infamous woman, who wished to have you killed that
she might inherit your wealth; but she could not marry your bro

being already married in france, and having been--" dâ€™artagnan stopped,
as if seeking for the word, and looked at athos.

"repudiated by her husband," said athos.

"because she had been branded," continued dâ€™artagnan.

"bah!" cried porthos. "impossible! what do you say--that she wanted to
have her brother-in-law killed?"

"yes."

"she was married?" asked aramis.

"yes."

"and her husband found out that she had a fleur-de-lis on her shoulder?"
cried porthos.

"yes."

these three yeses had been pronounced by athos, each with a sadder
intonation.

"and who has seen this fleur-de-lis?" inquired aramis.

"dâ€™artagnan and i. or rather, to observe the chronological order, i and
dâ€™artagnan," replied athos.

"and does the husband of this frightful creature still live?" said
aramis.

"he still lives."

"are you quite sure of it?"

"i am he."

there was a mom

ent of cold silence, during which everyone was affected
according to his nature.

"this time," said athos, first breaking the silence, "dâ€™artagnan has
given us an excellent program, and the letter must be written at once."

"the devil! you are right, athos," said aramis; "and it is a rather
difficult matter. the chancellor himself would be puzzled how to write
such a letter, and yet the chancellor draws up an official report very
readily. never mind! be silent, i will write."

aramis accordingly took the quill, reflected for a few moments, wrote
eight or ten lines in a charming little female hand, and then with a
voice soft and slow, as if each word had been scrupulously weighed, he
read the following:

"my lord, the person who writes these few lines had the honor of
crossing swords with you in the little enclosure of the rue dâ€™enfer. as
you have several times since declared yourself the friend of that
person, he thinks it his duty to respond to that friendship by sending

that before she contracted a marriage in england she was already married
in france. but the third time, which is the present, you may succumb.
your relative left la rochelle for england during the night. watch her
arrival, for she has great and terrible projects. if you require to know
positively what she is capable of, read her past history on her left
shoulder."

"well, now that will do wonderfully well," said athos. "my dear aramis,
you have the pen of a secretary of state. lord de winter will now be
upon his guard if the letter should reach him; and even if it should
fall into the hands of the cardinal, we shall not be compromised. but as
the lackey who goes may make us believe he has been to london and may
stop at chatellerault, let us give him only half the sum promised him,
with the letter, with an agreement that he shall have the other half in
exchange for the reply. have you the diamond?" continued athos.

"i have w

hat is still better. i have the price;" and dâ€™artagnan threw
the bag upon the table. at the sound of the gold aramis raised his eyes
and porthos started. as to athos, he remained unmoved.

"how much in that little bag?"

"seven thousand livres, in louis of twelve francs."

"seven thousand livres!" cried porthos. "that poor little diamond was
worth seven thousand livres?"

"it appears so," said athos, "since here they are. i donâ€™t suppose that
our friend dâ€™artagnan has added any of his own to the amount."

"but, gentlemen, in all this," said dâ€™artagnan, "we do not think of the
queen. let us take some hee

is the least we owe her."

"thatâ€™s true," said athos; "but that concerns aramis."

"well," replied the latter, blushing, "what must i say?"

"oh, thatâ€™s simple enough!" replied athos. "write a second letter for
that clever personage who lives at tours."

aramis resumed his pen, reflected a little, and wrote the following
lines, which he immediately submitted to the approbation of his friends.

"my dear cousin."

"ah, ah!" said athos. "this clever person is your relative, then?"

"cousin-german."

"go on, to your cousin, then!"

aramis continued:

"my dear cousin, his eminence, the cardinal, whom god preserve for the
happiness of france and the confusion of the enemies of the kingdom, is
on the point of putting an end to the hectic rebellion of la roch

extinguish the sun if the sun incommoded him. give these happy tidings
to your sister, my dear cousin. i have dreamed that the unlucky
englishman was dead. i cannot recollect whether it was by steel or by
poison; only of this i am sure, i have dreamed he was dead, and you know
my dreams never deceive me. be assured, then, of seeing me soon return."

"capital!" cried athos; "you are the king of poets, my dear aramis. you
speak like the apocalypse, and you are as true as the gospel. there is
nothing now to do but to put the address to this letter."

"that is easily done," said aramis.

he folded the letter fancifully, and took up his pen and wrote:

"to mlle. michon, seamstress, tours."

the three friends looked at one another and laughed; they were caught.

"now," said aramis, "you will please to understand, gentlemen, that
bazin alone can carry this letter to tours. my cousin knows nobody but
bazin, and p

llow himself to be taken, or if taken, will undergo martyrdom rather
than speak."

"very well," said dâ€™artagnan, "i consent to bazin with all my heart, but
grant me planchet. milady had him one day turned out of doors, with
sundry blows of a good stick to accelerate his motions. now, planchet
has an excellent memory; and i will be bound that sooner than relinquish
any possible means of vengeance, he will allow himself to be beaten to
death. if your arrangements at tours are your arrangements, aramis,
those of london are mine. i request, then, that planchet may be chosen,
more particularly as he has already been to london with me, and knows
how to speak correctly: london, sir, if you please, and my master, lord
dâ€™artagnan. with that you may be satisfied he can make his way, both
going and returning."

"in that case," said athos, "planchet must receive seven hundred livres
for going, and seven hundred livres for coming back; and bazin, three
hundred livres for going, and three hundred livr

of a thousand livres under the guardianship of monsieur abbe here, for
extraordinary occasions or common wants. will that do?"

"my dear athos," said aramis, "you speak like nestor, who was, as
everyone knows, the wisest among the greeks."

"well, then," said athos, "it is agreed. planchet and bazin shall go.
everything considered, i am not sorry to retain grimaud; he is
accustomed to my ways, and i am particular. yesterdayâ€™s affair must have
shaken him a little; his voyage would upset him quite."

been named to him by dâ€™artagnan, who in the first place pointed out the

in your fidelity, and who answers for you. but remember, also, that if
by your fault any evil happens to dâ€™artagnan, i will find you, wherever
you may be, for the purpose of ripping up your belly."

"oh, monsieur!" said planchet, humiliated by the suspicion, and
moreover, terrified at the calm air of the musketeer.

"and i," said porthos, rolling his large eyes, "remember, i will skin
you alive."

"ah, monsieur!"

"and i," said aramis, with his soft, melodius voice, "remember that i
will roast you at a slow fire, like a savage."

"ah, monsieur!"

planchet began to weep. we will not venture to say whether it was from
terror created by the threats or from tenderness at seeing four friends
so closely united.

dâ€™artagnan took his hand. "see, planchet," said he, "these gentlemen
only say this out of affection for me, but at bottom they all like you."

ved. more than once an involuntary
trembling seized them when called upon for some unexpected service. they
had, besides, to look constantly to their own proper safety; milady was
a phantom which, when it had once appeared to people, did not allow them
to sleep very quietly.

on the morning of the eighth day, bazin, fresh as ever, and smiling,
according to custom, entered the cabaret of the parpaillot as the four
friends were sitting down to breakfast, saying, as had been agreed upon:
"monsieur aramis, the answer from your cousin."

the four friends exchanged a joyful glance; half of the work was done.
it is true, however, that it was the shorter and easier part.

aramis, blushing in spite of himself, took the letter, which was in a
large, coarse hand and not particular for its orthography.

"good god!" cried he, laughing, "i quite despair of my poor michon; she
will never write like monsieur de voiture."

"what does you mean by boor michon?" said the swiss, who was chatting
with the four fr

iends when the letter came.

"oh, pardieu, less than nothing," said aramis; "a charming little
seamstress, whom i love dearly and from whose hand i requested a few
lines as a sort of keepsake."

"the duvil!" said the swiss, "if she is as great a lady as her writing
is large, you are a lucky fellow, gomrade!"

aramis read the letter, and passed it to athos.

"see what she writes to me, athos," said he.

athos cast a glance over the epistle, and to disperse all the suspicions
that might have been created, read aloud:

"my cousin,

"my sister and i are skillful in interpreting dreams, and even entertain
great fear of them; but of yours it may be said, i hope, every dream is
an illusion. adieu! take care of yourself, and act so that we may from
time to time hear you spoken of.

"marie michon"

"and what dream

does she mean?" asked the dragoon, who had approached
during the reading.

"yez; whatâ€™s the dream?" said the swiss.

"well, pardieu!" said aramis, "it was only this: i had a dream, and i
related it to her."

"yez, yez," said the swiss; "itâ€™s simple enough to dell a dream, but i
neffer dream."

"you are very fortunate," said athos, rising; "i wish i could say as
much!"

"neffer," replied the swiss, enchanted that a man like athos could envy
him anything. "neffer, neffer!"

dâ€™artagnan, seeing athos rise, did likewise, took his arm, and went out.

porthos and aramis remained behind to encounter the jokes of the dragoon
and the swiss.

more imagination than the swiss, he dreamed that aramis, having become
pope, adorned his head with a cardinalâ€™s hat.

but, as we have said, bazin had not, by his fortunate return, removed
more than a part of the uneasiness which weighed upon the four friends.
the days of expectation are long, and dâ€™artagnan, in particular, would
have wagered that the days were forty-four hours. he forgot the
necessary slowness of navigation; he exaggerated to himself the power of
milady. he credited this woman, who appeared to him the equal of a
demon, with agen

ts as supernatural as herself; at the least noise, he
imagined himself about to be arrested, and that planchet was being
brought back to be confronted with himself and his friends. still
further, his confidence in the worthy picard, at one time so great,
diminished day by day. this anxiety became so great that it even
extended to aramis and porthos. athos alone remained unmoved, as if no
danger hovered over him, and as if he breathed his customary atmosphere.

on the sixteenth day, in particular, these signs were so strong in
dâ€™artagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one
place, and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which planchet was
expected.

"really," said athos to them, "you are not men but children, to let a
woman terrify you so! and what does it amount to, after all? to be

 of his company. they were playing together, as
usual, when seven oâ€™clock sounded; the patrol was heard passing to
double the posts. at half past seven the retreat was sounded.

"we are lost," said dâ€™artagnan, in the ear of athos.

"you mean to say we have lost," said athos, quietly, drawing four
pistoles from his pocket and throwing them upon the table. "come,
gentlemen," said he, "they are beating the tattoo. let us to bed!"

and athos went out of the parpaillot, followed by dâ€™artagnan. aramis
came behind, giving his arm to porthos. aramis mumbled verses to
himself, and porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his
mustache, in sign of despair.

but all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which
was familiar to dâ€™artagnan, and a well-known voice said, "monsieur, i
have brought your cloak; it is chilly this evening."

"planchet!" cried dâ€™artagnan, beside himself with joy.

"planchet!" repeated aramis and porthos.

"well, yes, planchet, to be sure," sa

"well!" cried dâ€™artagnan, "tell us all about it."

"dame, thatâ€™s a long job, monsieur."

"you are right, planchet," said athos; "besides, the tattoo has been
sounded, and we should be observed if we kept a light burning much
longer than the others."

"so be it," said dâ€™artagnan. "go to bed, planchet, and sleep soundly."

"my faith, monsieur! that will be the first time i have done so for
sixteen days."

"and me, too!" said dâ€™artagnan.

"and me, too!" said porthos.

"and me, too!" said aramis.

"well, if you will have the truth, and me, too!" said athos.




49 fatality


meantime milady, drunk with passion, roaring on the deck like a lioness
that has been embarked, had been tempted to throw herself into the sea
that she might regain the coast, for she could not get rid of the
thought that she had been insulted by dâ€™artagnan, threatened by athos,
and that she had quit france without being revenged on them. this idea
soon became so insupportable to her that at the risk of whatever

alighted from his
horse, and went toward these suspected merry companions, hoping, by
means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and of the hedge
which concealed his approach, to catch some words of this conversation
which appeared so interesting. at ten paces from the hedge he recognized
the talkative gascon; and as he had already perceived that these men
were musketeers, he did not doubt that the three others were those
called the inseparables; that is to say, athos, porthos, and aramis.

it may be supposed that his desire to hear the conversation was
augmented by this discovery. his eyes took a strange expression, and
with the step of a tiger-cat he advanced toward the hedge; but he had
not been able to catch more than a few vague syllables without any
positive sense, when a sonorous and short cry made him start, and
attracted the attention of the musketeers.

"officer!" cried grimaud.

undergoing a real interrogatory. if it be so, we trust your eminence
will deign to explain yourself, and we should then at least be
acquainted with our real position."

"and if it were an interrogatory!" replied the cardinal. "others besides
you have undergone such, monsieur athos, and have replied thereto."

"thus i have told your eminence that you had but to question us, and we
are ready to reply."

"what was that letter you were about to read, monsieur aramis, and which
you so promptly concealed?"

"a womanâ€™s letter, monseigneur."

"ah, yes, i see," said the cardinal; "we must be discreet with this sort
of letters; but nevertheless, we may show them to a confessor, and you
know i have taken orders."

"monseigneur," said athos, with a calmness the more terrible because he
risked his head in making this reply, "the letter is a womanâ€™s letter,
but it is neither signed marion de lorme, nor madame dâ€™aiguillon."

the cardinal became as pale as death

nce of terror, for notwithstanding the
friendly adieu of his eminence, they plainly perceived that the cardinal
went away with rage in his heart.

athos alone smiled, with a self-possessed, disdainful smile.

when the cardinal was out of hearing and sight, "that grimaud kept bad
watch!" cried porthos, who had a great inclination to vent his ill-humor
on somebody.

grimaud was about to reply to excuse himself. athos lifted his finger,
and grimaud was silent.

"would you have given up the letter, aramis?" said dâ€™artagnan.

"i," said aramis, in his most flutelike tone, "i had made up my mind. if
he had insisted upon the letter being given up to him, i would have
presented the letter to him with one hand, and with the other i would
have run my sword through his body."

"i expected as much," said athos; "and that was why i threw myself
between you and him. indeed, this man is very much to blame for talking
thus to other men; one would say he had never had to do with any but
women and children."

love with a woman whom the cardinal has caused to be shut up, and you
wish to get her out of the hands of the cardinal. thatâ€™s a match you are
playing with his eminence; this letter is your game. why should you
expose your game to your adversary? that is never done. let him find it
out if he can! we can find out his!"

"well, thatâ€™s all very sensible, athos," said dâ€™artagnan.

"in that case, let there be no more question of whatâ€™s past, and let
aramis resume the letter from his cousin where the cardinal interrupted
him."

aramis drew the letter from his pocket; the three friends surrounded
him, and the three lackeys grouped themselves again near the wine jar.

"you had only read a line or two," said dâ€™artagnan; "read the letter
again from the commencement."

"willingly," said aramis.

"my dear cousin,

may happen unexpectedly.

"adieu, my dear cousin. tell us news of yourself as often as you can;
that is to say, as often as you can with safety. i embrace you.

"oh, what do i not owe you, aramis?" said dâ€™artagnan. "dear constance! i
have at length, then, intelligence of you. she lives; she is in safety
in a convent; she is at bethune! where is bethune, athos?"

"why, upon the frontiers of artois and of flanders. the siege once over,
we shall be able to make a tour in that direction."

"and that will not be long, it is to be hoped," said porthos; "for they
have this morning hanged a spy who confessed that the rochellais were
reduced to the leather of their shoes. supposing that after

"poor fools!" said athos, emptying a glass of excellent bordeaux wine
which, without having at that period the reputation it now enjoys,
merited it no less, "poor fools! as if the catholic religion was not the
most advantageous and the most agreeable of all religions! all the
same," resumed he, after having clicked his tongue against his palate,
"they are brave fellows! but what the devil are you about, aramis?"
continued athos. "why, you are squeezing that letter into your pocket!"

"yes," said dâ€™artagnan, "athos is right, it must be burned. and yet if
we burn it, who knows whether monsieur cardinal has not a secret to
interrogate ashes?"

"he must have one," said athos.

"what will you do with the letter, then?" asked porthos.

then that dâ€™artagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred
upon him in making him at last enter the musketeers--for without that
circumstance he would have been forced to remain in the camp while his
companions left it.

it goes without saying that this impatience to return toward paris had
for a cause the danger which mme. bonacieux would run of meeting at the
convent of bethune with milady, her mortal enemy. aramis therefore had
written immediately to marie michon, the seamstress at tours who had
such fine acquaintances, to obtain from the queen authority for mme.
bonacieux to leave the convent, and to retire either into lorraine or
belgium. they had not long to wait for an answer. eight or ten days
afterward aramis received the following letter:

"my dear cousin,

"here is the authorization from my sister to withdraw our little servant
from the convent of bethune, the air of which you think is bad for he

reat pleasure, for she is
very partial to the little girl, to whom she intends to be more

"i salute you,

to this letter was added an order, conceived in these terms:

"at the louvre, august 10, 1628

"the superior of the convent of bethune will place in the hands of the
person who shall present this note to her the novice who entered the
convent upon my recommendation and under my patronage.

"anne"

it may be easily imagined how the relationship between aramis and a
seamstress who called the queen her sister amused the young men; but
aramis, after having blushed two or three times up to the whites of his
eyes at the gross pleasantry of porthos, begged his friends not to
revert to the subject again, declaring that if a single word more was
said to him about it, he would never again implore his cousins to
interfere in such affairs.

there was no further question, therefore, about marie michon among the
four musketeers, who besides had what they wanted:

then, where you are, and do not exhaust yourselves with useless fatigue.
myself and planchet are all that such a simple expedition requires."

to this athos replied quietly: "we also have money left--for i have not
yet drunk all my share of the diamond, and porthos and aramis have not
eaten all theirs. we can therefore use up four horses as well as one.
but consider, dâ€™artagnan," added he, in a tone so solemn that it made
the young man shudder, "consider that bethune is a city where the
cardinal has given rendezvous to a woman who, wherever she goes, brings
misery with her. if you had only to deal with four men, dâ€™artagnan, i
would allow you to go alone. you have to do with that woman! we four

abducted. i have seen him; that is he! i recognized him when the wind
blew upon his cloak."

"the devil!" said athos, musingly.

"to saddle, gentlemen! to saddle! let us pursue him, and we shall
overtake him!"

"my dear friend," said aramis, "remember that he goes in an opposite
direction from that in which we are going, that he has a fresh horse,
and ours are fatigued, so that we shall disable our own horses without
even a chance of overtaking him. let the man go, dâ€™artagnan; let us save
the woman."

"monsieur, monsieur!" cried a hostler, running out and looking after the
stranger, "monsieur, here is a paper which dropped out of your hat! eh,

the hostler, enchanted with the good dayâ€™s work he had done, returned to
the yard. dâ€™artagnan unfolded the paper.

"well?" eagerly demanded all his three friends.

"nothing but one word!" said dâ€™artagnan.

"yes," said aramis, "but that one word is the name of some town or
village."

"armentieres," read porthos; "armentieres? i donâ€™t know such a place."

"and that name of a town or village is written in her hand!" cried
athos.

"come on, come on!" said dâ€™artagnan; "let us keep that paper carefully,
perhaps i have not thrown away my half-pistole. to horse, my friends, to

and the four friends flew at a gallop along the road to bethune.

as she was of herself, could not help uttering a cry, seizing the hand
of the novice, and devouring her with looks.

"what is the matter? good god!" asked the poor woman, "have i said
anything that has wounded you?"

"no; but the name struck me, because i also have known that gentleman,
and it appeared strange to me to meet with a person who appears to know
him well."

"oh, yes, very well; not only him, but some of his friends, messieurs
porthos and aramis!"

"indeed! you know them likewise? i know them," cried milady, who began
to feel a chill penetrate her heart.

"well, if you know them, you know that they are good and free
companions. why do you not apply to them, if you stand in need of help?"

"that is to say," stammered milady, "i am not really very intimate with
any of them. i know them from having heard one of their friends,
monsieur dâ€™artagnan, say a great deal about them."

"i thought so, too; but a letter which madame bonacieux has received

placing it in the lining of his hat, "you may be easy. i will do as
children do, for fear of losing the paper--repeat the name along the
route. now, is that all?"

"i believe so."

"let us see: buckingham dead or grievously wounded; your conversation

warned of your arrival at portsmouth; dâ€™artagnan and athos to the
bastille; aramis the lover of madame de chevreuse; porthos an ass;
madame bonacieux found again; to send you the chaise as soon as
possible; to place my lackey at your disposal; to make you out a victim
of the cardinal in order that the abbess may entertain no suspicion;
armentieres, on the banks of the lys. is that all, then?"

"constance? constance?" replied the young man, "where are you? where are
you? my god!"

at the same moment the door of the cell yielded to a shock, rather than
opened; several men rushed into the chamber. mme. bonacieux had sunk
into an armchair, without the power of moving.

dâ€™artagnan threw down a yet-smoking pistol which he held in his hand,
and fell on his knees before his mistress. athos replaced his in his
belt; porthos and aramis, who held their drawn swords in their hands,
returned them to their scabbards.

"oh, dâ€™artagnan, my beloved dâ€™artagnan! you have come, then, at last!
you have not deceived me! it is indeed thee!"

"yes, yes, constance. reunited!"

"oh, it was in vain she told me you would not come! i hoped in silence.
i was not willing to fly. oh, i have done well! how happy i am!"

at this word she, athos, who had seated himself quietly, started up.

"she! what she?" asked dâ€™artagnan.

"why, my companion

t the gate; of a woman who calls herself
your friend; of a woman to whom you have told everything."

"her name, her name!" cried dâ€™artagnan. "my god, can you not remember
her name?"

"yes, it was pronounced in my hearing once. stop--but--it is very
strange--oh, my god, my head swims! i cannot see!"

"help, help, my friends! her hands are icy cold," cried dâ€™artagnan. "she
is ill! great god, she is losing her senses!"

while porthos was calling for help with all the power of his strong
voice, aramis ran to the table to get a glass of water; but he stopped
at seeing the horrible alteration that had taken place in the
countenance of athos, who, standing before the table, his hair rising
from his head, his eyes fixed in stupor, was looking at one of the
glasses, and appeared a prey to the most horrible doubt.

"oh!" said athos, "oh, no, it is impossible! god would not permit such a
crime!"

"water, water!" cried dâ€™artagnan. "water!"

"oh, poor woman, poor woman!" murmured athos, in a broken

 the name of heaven, whose empty glass

"mine, monsieur," said the young woman, in a dying voice.

"but who poured the wine for you that was in this glass?"

"she."

"but who is she?"

"oh, i remember!" said mme. bonacieux, "the comtesse de winter."

the four friends uttered one and the same cry, but that of athos
dominated all the rest.

at that moment the countenance of mme. bonacieux became livid; a fearful
agony pervaded her frame, and she sank panting into the arms of porthos
and aramis.

dâ€™artagnan seized the hands of athos with an anguish difficult to be
described.

"and what do you believe?â€™ his voice was stifled by sobs.

"i believe everything," said athos, biting his lips till the blood
sprang to avoid sighing.

"dâ€™artagnan, dâ€™artagnan!" cried mme. bonacieux, "where art thou? do not
leave me! you see i am dying!"

dâ€™artagnan released the hands of athos which he still held clasped in
both his own, and hastened to her. her beautiful face was distorted with
agony;

her glassy eyes had no longer their sight; a convulsive
shuddering shook her whole body; the sweat rolled from her brow.

"in the name of heaven, run, call! aramis! porthos! call for help!"

"useless!" said athos, "useless! for the poison which she pours there is
no antidote."

"yes, yes! help, help!" murmured mme. bonacieux; "help!"

then, collecting all her strength, she took the head of the young man
between her hands, looked at him for an instant as if her whole soul
passed into that look, and with a sobbing cry pressed her lips to his.

"constance, constance!" cried dâ€™artagnan.

a sigh escaped from the mouth of mme. bonacieux, and dwelt for an
inst

ant on the lips of dâ€™artagnan. that sigh was the soul, so chaste and
so loving, which reascended to heaven.

dâ€™artagnan pressed nothing but a corpse in his arms. the young man
uttered a cry, and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy
as herself.

porthos wept; aramis pointed toward heaven; athos made the sign of the
cross.

at that moment a man appeared in the doorway, almost as pale as those in
the chamber. he looked around him and saw mme. bonacieux dead, and
dâ€™artagnan in a swoon. he appeared just at that moment of stupor which
follows great catastrophes.

"i was not deceived," said he; "here is monsieur dâ€™artagnan; and you are
his friends, messieurs athos, porthos, and aramis."

the persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger wit

going about at random, inquiring of everybody, when i saw you gallop
past. i recognized monsieur dâ€™artagnan. i called to you, but you did not
answer me; i wished to follow you, but my horse was too much fatigued to
go at the same pace with yours. and yet it appears, in spite of all your
diligence, you have arrived too late."

"you see!" said athos, pointing to mme. bonacieux dead, and to
dâ€™artagnan, whom porthos and aramis were trying to recall to life.

"are they both dead?" asked lord de winter, sternly.

"no," replied athos, "fortunately monsieur dâ€™artagnan has only fainted."

"ah, indeed, so much the better!" said lord de winter.

at that moment dâ€™artagnan opened his eyes. he tore himself from the arms
of porthos and aramis, and threw himself like a madman on the corpse of
his mistress.

athos rose, walked toward his friend with a slow and solemn step,
embraced him tenderly, and as he burst into violent s

obs, he said to him
with his noble and persuasive voice, "friend, be a man! women weep for
the dead; men avenge them!"

"oh, yes!" cried dâ€™artagnan, "yes! if it be to avenge her, i am ready to
follow you."

athos profited by this moment of strength which the hope of vengeance
restored to his unfortunate friend to make a sign to porthos and aramis
to go and fetch the superior.

the two friends met her in the corridor, greatly troubled and much upset
by such strange events; she called some of the nuns, who against all
monastic custom found themselves in the presence of five men.

"madame," said athos, passing his arm under that of dâ€™artagnan, "we
abandon to your pious care the body of that unfortunate woman. she was
an angel on earth before being an angel in heaven. treat her as one of
your sisters. we will return someday to pray over h

to the town of bethune, whose outskirts they perceived, and stopped
before the first inn they came to.

"but," said dâ€™artagnan, "shall we not pursue that woman?"

"later," said athos. "i have measures to take."

"she will escape us," replied the young man; "she will escape us, and it
will be your fault, athos."

"i will be accountable for her," said athos.

dâ€™artagnan had so much confidence in the word of his friend that he
lowered his head, and entered the inn without reply.

porthos and aramis regarded each other, not understanding this assurance
of athos.

lord de winter believed he spoke in this manner to soothe the grief of
dâ€™artagnan.

"now, gentlemen," said athos, when he had ascertained there were five
chambers free in the hotel, "let everyone retire to his own apartment.
dâ€™artagnan needs to be alone, to weep and to sleep. i take charge of
everything; be easy."

"it appears, however," said lord de winter, "if there are any measures
to take against the countess, it concerns

me; she is my sister-in-law."

"and me," said athos, "--she is my wife!"

dâ€™artagnan smiled--for he understood that athos was sure of his
vengeance when he revealed such a secret. porthos and aramis looked at
each other, and grew pale. lord de winter thought athos was mad.

"now, retire to your chambers," said athos, "and leave me to act. you
must perceive that in my quality of a husband this concerns me. only,
dâ€™artagnan, if you have not lost it, give me the paper which fell from
that manâ€™s hat, upon which is written the name of the village of--"

"ah," said dâ€™artagnan, "i comprehend! that name written in her hand."

"you see, then," said athos, "there is a god in heaven still!"

 about eleven oâ€™clock the night before, had
engaged a chamber, had sent for the master of the hotel, and told him
she desired to remain some time in the neighborhood.

planchet had no need to learn more. he hastened to the rendezvous, found
the lackeys at their posts, placed them as sentinels at all the outlets
of the hotel, and came to find athos, who had just received this
information when his friends returned.

all their countenances were melancholy and gloomy, even the mild
countenance of aramis.

"what is to be done?" asked dâ€™artagnan.

"to wait!" replied athos.

each retired to his own apartment.

at eight oâ€™clock in the evening athos ordered the horses to be saddled,
and lord de winter and his friends notified that they must prepare for
the expedition.

in an instant all five were ready. each examined his arms, and put them
in order. athos came down last, and found dâ€™artagnan already on
horseback, and growing impatient.

"patience!" cried athos; "one of our party is still want

all remained in darkness.

every minute athos was forced to restrain dâ€™artagnan, constantly in
advance of the little troop, and to beg him to keep in the line, which
in an instant he again departed from. he had but one thought--to go
forward; and he went.

they passed in silence through the little village of festubert, where
the wounded servant was, and then skirted the wood of richebourg. at
herlier, planchet, who led the column, turned to the left.

several times lord de winter, porthos, or aramis tried to talk with the
man in the red cloak; but to every interrogation which they put to him
he bowed, without response. the travelers then comprehended that there
must be some reason why the unknown preserved such a silence, and ceased
to address themselves to him.

the storm increased, the flashes succeeded one another more rapidly, the
thunder began to growl, and the wind, the precursor of a hurricane,
whistled in the plumes and the hair of the horsemen.

the cavalcade trotted on more sharp

milady recoiled, uttering a cry. dâ€™artagnan, believing she might have
means of flight and fearing she should escape, drew a pistol from his
belt; but athos raised his hand.

"put back that weapon, dâ€™artagnan!" said he; "this woman must be tried,
not assassinated. wait an instant, my friend, and you shall be
satisfied. come in, gentlemen."

dâ€™artagnan obeyed; for athos had the solemn voice and the powerful
gesture of a judge sent by the lord himself. behind dâ€™artagnan entered
porthos, aramis, lord de winter, and the man in the red cloak.

the four lackeys guarded the door and the window.

milady had sunk into a chair, with her hands extended, as if to conjure
this terrible apparition. perceiving her brother-in-law, she uttered a
terrible cry.

"what do you want?" screamed milady.

"we want," said athos, "charlotte backson, who first was called comtesse
de la fere, and afterwards milady de winter, baroness of sheffield."

"that is i! that is i!" murmured milady, in extreme terror; "

what do you
want?"

"we wish to judge you according to your crime," said athos; "you shall
be free to defend yourself. justify yourself if you can. m. dâ€™artagnan,
it is for you to accuse her first."

dâ€™artagnan advanced.

"before god and before men," said he, "i accuse this woman of having
poisoned constance bonacieux, who died yesterday evening."

he turned towards porthos and aramis.

"we bear witness to this," said the two musketeers, with one voice.

dâ€™artagnan continued: "before god and before men, i accuse this woman of
having attempted to poison me, in wine which she sent me from villeroy,
with a forged letter, as if that wine came from my friends. god
preserved me, but a man named brisemont died in my place."

"we bear witness to this," said porthos and aramis, in the same manner
as before.

"before god and before men, i accuse this woman of having urged me to
the

murder of the baron de wardes; but as no one else can attest the
truth of this accusation, i attest it myself. i have done." and
dâ€™artagnan passed to the other side of the room with porthos and aramis.

"your turn, my lord," said athos.

the baron came forward.

"before god and before men," said he, "i accuse this woman of having
caused the assassination of the duke of buckingham."

"the duke of buckingham assassinated!" cried all present, with one
voice.

"yes," said the baron, "assassinated. on receiving the warning letter
you wrote to me, i had this woman arrested, and gave her in charge to a
loyal servant. she corrupted this man; she placed the poniard in his
hand; she made him kill the

duke. and at this moment, perhaps, felton is
paying with his head for the crime of this fury!"

a shudder crept through the judges at the revelation of these unknown
crimes.

"that is not all," resumed lord de winter. "my brother, who made you his
heir, died in three hours of a strange disorder which left livid traces
all over the body. my sister, how did your husband die?"

"horror!" cried porthos and aramis.

"assassin of buckingham, assassin of felton, assassin of my brother, i
demand justice upon you, and i swear that if it be not granted to me, i
will execute it myself."

and lord de winter ranged himself by the side of dâ€™artagnan, leaving the
place free for another accuser.

milady let her head sink between her two hands, and tried to recall her
ideas, whirling in a mortal vertigo.

"my turn," said athos, himself trembling as the lion trembles at the
sight of the serpent--"my turn. i married

ned me, they kept their word. as
soon as the identity of my brother was proved, i was set at liberty.

"that is the crime of which i accuse her; that is the cause for which
she was branded."

"monsieur dâ€™artagnan," said athos, "what is the penalty you demand
against this woman?"

"the punishment of death," replied dâ€™artagnan.

"my lord de winter," continued athos, "what is the penalty you demand
against this woman?"

"the punishment of death," replied lord de winter.

"messieurs porthos and aramis," repeated athos, "you who are her judges,
what is the sentence you pronounce upon this woman?"

"the punishment of death," replied the musketeers, in a hollow voice.

milady uttered a frightful shriek, and dragged herself along several
paces upon her knees toward her judges.

athos stretched out his hand toward her.

"charlotte backson, comtesse de la fere, milady de winter," said he,
"your crimes have wearied men on earth and god in heaven. if you know a
prayer, say it--for you are condemned,
 
 ___________________________
 
 and you shall die."

at these words, which left no hope, milady raised herself in all her
pride, and wished to speak; but her strength failed her. she felt that a
powerful and implacable hand seized her by the hair, and dragged her
away as irrevocably as fatality drags humanity. she did not, therefore,
even attempt the least resistance, and went out of the cottage.

lord de winter, dâ€™artagnan, athos, porthos, and aramis, went out close
behind her. the lackeys followed their masters, and the chamber was left
solitary, with its broken window, its open door, and its smoky lamp
burning sadly on the table.




66 execution


it was near midnight; the moon, lessened by its decline, and reddened by
the last traces of the storm, arose behind the little town of
armentieres, which showed against its pale light the dark outline of its
houses, and the skeleton of its high belfry. in front of them the lys

ent over the black mass of trees, and
like a terrible scimitar divided the heavens and the waters into two
parts. not a breath of wind now disturbed the heavy atmosphere. a
deathlike silence oppressed all nature. the soil was humid and
glittering with the rain which had recently fallen, and the refreshed
herbs sent forth their perfume with additional energy.

two lackeys dragged milady, whom each held by one arm. the executioner
walked behind them, and lord de winter, dâ€™artagnan, porthos, and aramis
walked behind the executioner. planchet and bazin came last.

the two lackeys conducted milady to the bank of the river. her mouth was
mute; but her eyes spoke with their inexpressible eloquence,
supplicating by turns each of those on whom she looked.

being a few paces in advance she whispered to the lackeys, "a thousand
pistoles to each of you, if you will assist my escape; but if you
deliver me up to your masters, i have near at hand avengers who will
make you pay dearly for my death."

his eminence, monsieur the chevalier," said athos,
advancing; "and you will please to accept the word of monsieur
dâ€™artagnan that he will go straight to la rochelle."

"i must place him in the hands of guards who will take him into camp."

"we will be his guards, monsieur, upon our word as gentlemen; but
likewise, upon our word as gentlemen," added athos, knitting his brow,
"monsieur dâ€™artagnan shall not leave us."

the chevalier de rochefort cast a glance backward, and saw that porthos
and aramis had placed themselves between him and the gate; he understood
that he was completely at the mercy of these four men.

"gentlemen," said he, "if monsieur dâ€™artagnan will surrender his sword
to me and join his word to yours, i shall be satisfied with your promise
to convey monsieur dâ€™artagnan to the quarters of monseigneur the
cardinal."

"you have my word, monsieur, and here is my sword."

"this suits me the better," said rochefort, "as i wish to continue my
journey."

to the great astonishment of the young man.

"yes," said he, "yes, that would flatter me very much; but i should not
have time enough to enjoy the distinction. during our expedition to
bethune the husband of my duchess died; so, my dear, the coffer of the
defunct holding out its arms to me, i shall marry the widow. look here!
i was trying on my wedding suit. keep the lieutenancy, my dear, keep
it."

the young man then entered the apartment of aramis. he found him
kneeling before a priedieu with his head leaning on an open prayer book.

he described to him his interview with the cardinal, and said, for the
third time drawing his commission from his pocket, "you, our friend, our
intelligence, our invisible protector, accept this commission. you have
merited it more than any of us by your wisdom and your counsels, always
followed by such happy results."

"alas, dear friend!" said aramis, "our late adventures have disgusted me

eceived in triumph, as if he came from conquering
an enemy and not frenchmen. he entered by the faubourg st. jacques,
under verdant arches.

dâ€™artagnan took possession of his command. porthos left the service, and
in the course of the following year married mme. coquenard; the coffer
so much coveted contained eight hundred thousand livres.

mousqueton had a magnificent livery, and enjoyed the satisfaction of
which he had been ambitious all his life--that of standing behind a
gilded carriage.

aramis, after a journey into lorraine, disappeared all at once, and
ceased to write to his friends; they learned at a later period through
mme. de chevreuse, who told it to two or three of her intimates, that,
yielding to his vocation, he had retired into a convent--only into
which, nobody knew.

bazin became a lay brother.

athos remained a musketeer under the command of dâ€™artagnan till the year
1633, at which period, after a journey he made to touraine, he also quit
the service, under the pretext
