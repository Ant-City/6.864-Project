ut few slaves; and at her death those were all distributed among her relatives. five of them were my grandmother's children, and had shared the same milk that nourished her mother's children. notwithstanding my grandmother's long and faithful service to her owners, not one of her children escaped the auction block. these god-breathing machines are no more, in the sight of their masters, than the cotton they plant, or the horses they tend.

the new master and mistress.

        dr. flint, a physician in the neighborhood, had married the sister of my mistress, and i was now the property of their little daughter. it was not without murmuring that i prepared for my new home; and what added to my unhappiness, was the fact that my brother william was purchased by the same family. my father, by his nature, as well as by the habit of transacting business as a skilful mechanic, had more of the feelings of a freeman than is common among slaves. my brother was a spirited boy; and being b

y thing about it, linda," he replied. "we shall have to stay here all our days; we shall never be free."

        i argued that we were growing older and stronger, and that perhaps we might, before long, be allowed to hire our own time, and then we could earn money to buy our freedom. william declared this was much easier to say than to do; moreover, he did not intend to buy his freedom. we held daily controversies upon this subject.

        little attention was paid to the slaves' meals in dr. flint's house. if they could catch a bit of food while it was going, well and good. i gave myself no trouble on that score, for on my various errands i passed my grandmother's house, where there was always something to spare for me. i was frequently threatened with punishment if i stopped there; and my grandmother, to avoid detaining me, often stood at the gate with something for my breakfast or dinner. i was indebted to her for all my comforts, spiritual or temporal.

upplied my scanty wardrobe. i have a vivid recollection of the linsey-woolsey dress given me every winter by mrs. flint. how i hated it! it was one of the badges of slavery.

        while my grandmother was thus helping to support me from her hard earnings, the three hundred dollars she had lent her mistress were never repaid. when her mistress died, her son-in-law, dr. flint, was appointed executor. when grandmother applied to him for payment, he said the estate was insolvent, and the law prohibited payment. it did not, however, prohibit him from retaining the silver candelabra, which had been purchased with that money. i presume they will be handed down in the family, from generation to generation.

        my grandmother's mistress had always promised her that, at her death, she should be free; and it was said that in her will she made good the promise. but when

the estate was settled, dr. flint told the faithful old servant that, under existing circumstances, it was necessary she should be sold.

        on the appointed day, the customary advertisement was posted up, proclaiming that there would be "a public sale of negroes, horses, &c." dr. flint called to tell my grandmother that he was unwilling to wound her feelings by putting her up at auction, and that he would prefer to dispose of her at private sale. my grandmother saw through his hypocrisy; she understood very well that he was ashamed of the job. she was a very spirited woman, and if he was base enough to sell her, when her mistress intended she should be free, she was determined the public should

        at that time, my grandmother was just fifty years old. laborious years had passed since then; and now my brother and i were slaves to the man who had defrauded her of her money, and tried to defraud her of her freedom. one of my mother's sisters, called aunt nancy, was also a slave in his family. she was a kind, good aunt to me; and supplied the

page 22
place of both housekeeper and waiting maid to her mistress. she was, in fact, at the beginning and end of every thing.

        mrs. flint, like many southern women, was totally deficient in energy. she had not strength to superintend her household affairs; but her nerves were so strong, that she could sit in her easy chair and see a woman whipped, till the blood trickled from every stroke of the lash. she was a member of the church; but partaking of the lord's supper did not seem to put her in a christian frame of mind. if dinner was not served at the exact time on that particular sunday, she would station herself in the kitchen,

that had been used for cooking. she did this to prevent the cook and her children from eking out their meagre fare with the remains of the gravy and other scrapings. the slaves could get nothing to eat except what she chose to give them. provisions were weighed out by the pound and ounce, three times a day. i can assure you she gave them no chance to eat wheat bread from her flour barrel. she knew how many biscuits a quart of flour would make, and exactly what size they ought to be.

        dr. flint was an epicure. the cook never sent a dinner to his table without fear and trembling; for if there happened to be a dish not to his liking, he would either order her to be whipped, or compel her to eat every mouthful of it in his presence. the poor, hungry creature might not have objected to eating it; but she did object to having her master cram it down her throat till she choked.

        they had a pet dog, that was a nuisance in the house.

 him of stealing corn; others said the slave had quarrelled with his wife, in presence of the overseer, and had accused his master of being the father of her child. they were both black, and the child was very fair.

        i went into the work house next morning, and saw the cowhide still wet with blood, and the boards all covered with gore. the poor man lived, and continued to quarrel with his wife. a few months afterwards

page 24
dr. flint handed them both over to a slave-trader. the guilty man put their value into his pocket, and had the satisfaction of knowing that they were out of sight and hearing. when the mother was delivered into the trader's hands, she said, "you promised to treat me well." to which he replied, "you have let your tongue run too far; damn you!" she had forgotten that it was a crime for a slave to tell who was the father of her child.

 "don't grieve so, mother; god knows all about it; and he will have mercy upon me."

        her sufferings, afterwards, became so intense, that her mistress felt unable to stay; but when she left the room, the scornful smile was still on her lips. seven children called her mother. the poor black woman had but the one child, whose eyes she saw closing in death, while she thanked god for taking her away from the greater bitterness of life.

        two years had passed since i entered dr. flint's family, and those years had brought much of the knowledge that comes from experience, though they had afforded little opportunity for any other kinds of knowledge.
        my grandmother had, as much as possible, been a mother to her orphan grandchildren. by perseverance and unwearied industry, she was now mistress of a snug little home, surrounded with the necessaries of life. she would have been happy could her children have shared them with her. there remained but three children and two gr

        i remember the first time i was punished. it was in the month of february. my grandmother had taken my old shoes, and replaced them with a new pair. i needed them; for several inches of snow had fallen, and it still continued to fall. when i walked

page 32
through mrs. flint's room, their creaking grated harshly on her refined nerves. she called me to her, and asked what i had about me that made such a horrid noise. i told her it was my new shoes. "take them off," said she; "and if you put them on again, i'll throw them into the fire."

        i took them off, and my stockings also. she then sent me a long distance, on an errand. as i went through the snow, my bare feet tingled. that night i was very hoarse; and i went to bed thinking the next day would find me si

        i had imagined if i died, or was laid up for some time, that my mistress would feel a twinge of remorse that she had so hated "the little imp," as she styled me. it was my ignorance of that mistress that gave rise to such extravagant imaginings.

        dr. flint occasionally had high prices offered for me; but he always said, "she don't belong to me. she is my daughter's property, and i have no right to sell her." good, honest man! my young mistress was still a child, and i could look for no protection from her. i loved her, and she returned my affection. i once heard her father allude to her attachment to me; and his wife promptly replied that it proceeded from fear. this put unpleasant doubts into my mind. did the child feign what she did not feel? o

the trials of girlhood.

        during the first years of my service in dr. flint's family, i was accustomed to share some indulgences with the children of my mistress. though this seemed to me no more than right, i was grateful for it, and tried to merit the kindness by the faithful discharge of my duties. but i now entered on my fifteenth year—a sad epoch in the life of a slave girl. my master began to whisper foul words in my ear. young as i was, i could not remain ignorant of their import. i tried to treat them with indifference or contempt. the master's age, my extrem

 given me became heavy with sad forebodings. the other slaves in my master's house noticed the change. many of them pitied me; but none dared to ask the cause. they had no need to inquire. they knew too well the guilty practices under that roof; and they were aware that to speak of them was an offence that never went unpunished.

        i longed for some one to confide in. i would have given the world to have laid my head on my grandmother's faithful bosom, and told her all my troubles. but dr. flint swore he would kill me, if i was not as silent as the grave. then, although my grandmother was all in all to me, i feared her as well as loved her. i had been accustomed to look up to her with a respect bordering upon awe. i was very young, and felt shamefaced about telling her such impure things,

page 47
especially as i knew her to be very strict on such subjects. moreover, she was a woman of a high spirit. she was usually very quiet in her demeanor; but if her indignation was once roused, it

 was not very easily quelled. i had been told that she once chased a white gentleman with a loaded pistol, because he insulted one of her daughters. i dreaded the consequences of a violent outbreak; and both pride and fear kept me silent. but though i did not confide in my grandmother, and even evaded her vigilant watchfulness and inquiry, her presence in the neighborhood was some protection to me. though she had been a slave, dr. flint was afraid of her. he dreaded her scorching rebukes. moreover, she was known and patronized by many people; and he did not wish to have his villany made public. it was lucky for me that i did not live on a distant plantation, but in a town not so large that the inhabitants were ignorant of each other's affairs. bad as are the laws and customs in a slaveholding community, the doctor, as a professional man, deemed it prudent to keep up some outward show of decency.

and than to be the most pampered among the slaves of america. i would rather drudge out my life on a cotton plantation, till the grave opened to give me rest, than to live with an unprincipled master and a jealous mistress. the felon's home in a penitentiary is preferable. he may repent, and turn from the error of his ways, and so find peace; but it is not so with a favorite slave. she is not allowed to have any pride of character. it is deemed a crime in her to wish to be virtuous.
        mrs. flint possessed the key to her husband's character before i was born. she might have used this knowledge to counsel and to screen the young and the innocent among her slaves; but for them she had no sympathy. they were the objects of her constant suspicion and malevolence. she watched her husband with unceasing vigilance; but he was well practiced in means to evade it. what he could not find opportunity to say in words he manifested in signs. he invented more than were ever thought of in a deaf and d

        i had entered my sixteenth year, and every day it became more apparent that my presence was intolerable to mrs. flint. angry words frequently passed between her and her husband. he had never punished me himself, and he would not allow any body else to punish me. in that respect, she was never satisfied; but, in her angry moods, no terms were too vile for her to bestow upon me. yet i, whom she detested so bitterly, had far more pity for her than he had, whose duty it was to make her life happy. i never wronged her, or wished to wrong her; and one word of kindness from her would have brought me to her feet.

in some degree. but he resolved to remove the obstacle in the way of his scheme; and he thought he had planned it so that he should evade suspicion. he was well aware how much i prized my refuge by the side of my old aunt, and he determined to dispossess me of it. the first night the doctor had the little child in his room alone. the next morning, i was ordered to take my station as nurse the following night. a kind providence interposed in my favor. during the day mrs. flint heard of this new arrangement, and a storm followed. i rejoiced to hear it rage.

        after a while my mistress sent for me to come to her room. her first question was, "did you know you were to sleep in the doctor's room?"

        "my master."

page 59
was too wilful and arbitrary a man to consent to that arrangement. from him, i was sure of experiencing all sorts of opposition, and i had nothing to hope from my mistress. she would have been delighted to have got rid of me, but not in that way. it would have relieved her mind of a burden if she could have seen me sold to some distant state, but if i was married near home i should be just as much in her husband's power as i had previously been,—for the husband of a slave has no powe

        this love-dream had been my support through many trials; and i could not bear to run the risk of having it suddenly dissipated. there was a lady in the neighborhood, a particular friend of dr. flint's, who often visited the house. i had a great respect for her, and she had always manifested a friendly interest in me. grandmother thought she would have great influence with the doctor. i went to this lady, and told her my story. i told her i was aware that my lover's being a free-born man would prove a great objection; but he wanted to buy me; and if dr. flint would consent to that arrangement, i felt sure he would be willing to pay any reasonable price. she knew that mrs. flint disliked me;

and asked me why i had not answered it. i replied, "i am your daughter's property, and it is in your power to send me, or take me, wherever you please." he said he was very glad to find me so willing to go, and that we should start early in the autumn. he had a large practice in the town, and i rather thought he had made up the story merely to frighten me. however that might be, i was determined that i would never go to louisiana with him.

        summer passed away, and early in the autumn dr. flint's eldest son was sent to louisiana to examine the country, with a view to emigrating. that news did not disturb me. i knew very well that i should not be sent with him. that i had not been taken to the plantation before this time, was owing to the fact that his son was there. he was jealous of his son; and jealousy of the overseer had kept him from punishing me by

a perilous passage in the slave girl's life.

        after my lover went away, dr. flint contrived a new plan. he seemed to have an idea that my fear of my mistress was his greatest obstacle. in the blandest tones, he told me that he was going to build a small house for me, in a secluded place, four miles away from the town. i shuddered; but i was constrained to listen, while he talked of his intention to give me a home of my own, and to make a lady of me. hitherto, i had escaped my dreaded fate, by being in the midst of people. my grandmother had already had high words with my mas

ter about me. she had told him pretty plainly what she thought of his character, and there was considerable gossip in the neighborhood about our affairs, to which the open-mouthed jealousy of mrs. flint contributed not a little. when my master said he was going to build a house for me, and that he could do it with little trouble and expense, i was in hopes something would happen to frustrate his scheme; but i soon heard that the house was actually begun. i vowed before my maker that i would never enter it. i had rather toil on the plantation from dawn till dark; i had rather live and die in jail, than drag on, from day to day, through such a living death. i was determined that the master, whom

        i have told you that dr. flint's persecutions and his wife's jealousy had given rise to some gossip in the neighborhood. among others, it chanced that a white unmarried gentleman had obtained some knowledge of the circumstances in which i was placed. he knew my grandmother, and often spoke to me in the street. he became interested for me, and asked questions about my master, which i answered in part. he expressed a great deal of sympathy, and a wish to aid me. he constantly sought opportunities to see me, and wrote to me fre

 with an unmarried man, as with one who has a wife to be made unhappy. there may be sophistry in all this; but the condition of a slave confuses all principles of morality, and, in fact, renders the practice of them impossible.

        when i found that my master had actually begun to build the lonely cottage, other feelings mixed with those i have described. revenge, and calculations of interest, were added to flattered vanity and sincere gratitude for kindness. i knew nothing would enrage dr. flint so much as to know that i favored another; and it was something to triumph over my tyrant even in that small way. i thought he would revenge himself by selling me, and i was sure my friend, mr. sands, would buy me. he was a man of more generosity and feeling than my master, and i thought my freedom could be easily obtained from him. the crisis of my fate now came so near that i was desperate. i shuddered to think of being the mother of children that should be owned by my old tyrant. i knew that

        the months passed on. i had many unhappy hours. i secretly mourned over the sorrow i was bringing on my grandmother, who had so tried to shield me from harm. i knew that i was the greatest comfort of her old age, and that it was a source of pride to her that i had not degraded myself, like most of the slaves. i wanted to confess to her that i was no longer worthy of her love; but i could not utter the dreaded words.

        as for dr. flint, i had a feeling of satisfaction and triumph in the thought of telling him. from time to time he told me of his intended arrangements, and i was silent. at last, he came and told me the cottage was completed, and ordered me to go to it. i told him i would never enter it. he said, "i have heard

enough of such talk as that. you shall go, if you are carried by force; and you shall remain there." i replied, "i will never go there. in a few months i shall be a mother."

the new tie to life.

        i returned to my good grandmother's house. she had an interview with mr. sands. when she asked him why he could not have left her one ewe lamb,—whether there were not plenty of slaves who did not care about character,—he made no answer; but he spoke kind and encouraging words. he promised to care for my child, and to buy me, be the conditions what they might.
        i had not seen dr. flint for five days. i had never seen him since i made the avowal to him. he talked of the disgrace i had brought on myself; how i had sinned against my master, and mortified my old grandmother. he intimated that if i had accepted his proposals, he, as a physician, could have saved me from exposure. he even condescended to pity me. could he have offered wormwood more bitter? he, whose persecutions had been the cause of my sin!

        when my babe was born, they said it was premature. it weighed only four pounds; but god let it live. i heard the doctor say i could not survive till morning. i had often prayed for death; but now i did not want to die, unless my child could die too. many weeks passed before i was able to leave my bed. i was a mere wreck of my former self. for a year there was scarcely a day when i was free from chills and fever. my babe also was sickly. his little limbs were often racked with pain. dr. flint continued his visits, to look after my health; and he did not fail to remind me that my child was an addition to his stock of slaves.

        i felt too feeble to dispute with him, and listened to his remarks in silence. his visits were less frequent; but his busy spirit could not remain quiet. he employed my brother in his office, and he was made the medium of frequent notes and messages to me. william was a bright lad, and of much use to the doctor. he had learned to put up medicines, to lee

        i was invited to attend, because i could read. sunday evening came, and, trusting to the cover of night, i ventured out. i rarely ventured out by daylight, for i always went with fear, expecting at every turn to encounter dr. flint, who was sure to turn me back, or order me to his office to inquire where i got my bonnet, or some other article of dress. when the rev. mr. pike came, there were some twenty persons present. the reverend gentleman knelt in prayer, then seated himself, and requested all present, who could read, to open their books, while he gave out the portions he wished them to repeat or respond to.

        when i was told that dr. flint had joined the episcopal church, i was much surprised. i supposed that religion had a purifying effect on the character of men; but the worst persecutions i endured from him were after he was a communicant. the conversation of the doctor, the day after he had been confirmed, certainly gave me no indication that he had "renounced the devil and all his works." in answer to some of his usual talk, i reminded him that he had just joined the church.

"the child shall follow the condition of the mother," not of the father; thus taking care that licentiousness shall not interfere with avarice. this reflection made me clasp my innocent babe all the more firmly to my heart. horrid visions passed through my mind when i thought of his liability to fall into the slave trader's hands. i wept over him, and said, "o my child! perhaps they will leave you in some cold cabin to die, and then throw you into a hole, as if you were a dog."

        when dr. flint learned that i was again to be a mother, he was exasperated beyond measure. he rushed from the house, and returned with a pair of shears. i had a fine head of hair; and he often railed about my pride of arranging it nicely. he cut every hair close to my head, storming and swearing all the time. i replied to some of his abuse, and he struck me. some months before, he had pitched me down stairs in a fit of passion; and the injury i received was so serious that i was unable to turn myself in bed f

        when they told me my new-born babe was a girl, my heart was heavier than it had ever been before. slavery is terrible for men; but it is far more terrible for women. superadded to the burden common to all, they have wrongs, and sufferings, and mortifications peculiarly their own.

        dr. flint had sworn that he would make me suffer, to my last day, for this new crime against him, as he called it; and as long as he had me in his power he kept his word. on the fourth day after the birth of my babe, he entered my room suddenly, and commanded me to rise and bring my baby to him. the nurse who took care of me had gone out of the room to prepare some nourishment, and i was alone. there was no alternative. i rose, took up my babe, and crossed the room to where he sat.

      always it gave me a pang that my children had no lawful claim to a name. their father offered his; but, if i had wished to accept the offer, i dared not while my master lived. moreover, i knew it would not be accepted at their baptism. a christian name they were at least entitled to; and we resolved to call my boy for our dear good benjamin, who had gone far away from us.

        my grandmother belonged to the church; and she was very desirous of having the children christened. i knew dr. flint would forbid it, and i did not venture to attempt it. but chance favored me. he was called to visit a patient out of town, and was obliged to be absent during sunday. "now is the time," said my grandmother; "we will take the children to church, and have them christened."

        when i entered the church, recollections of my mother came over me, and i felt subdued in spirit. there she had presented me for baptism, without any reason to feel ashamed. she had been married, and had such legal rig

        when we left the church, my father's old mistress invited me to go home with her. she clasped a gold chain round my baby's neck. i thanked her for this kindness; but i did not like the emblem. i wanted no chain to be fastened on my daughter, not even if its links were of gold. how earnestly i prayed that she might never feel the weight of slavery's chain, whose iron entereth into the soul!

        my children grew finely; and dr. flint would often say to me, with an exulting smile, "these brats will bring me a handsome sum of money one of these days."
        i thought to myself that, god being my helper, they should never pass into his hands. it seemed to me i would rather see them killed than have them given up to his power. the money for the freedom of myself and my children could be obtained; but i derived no advantage from that circumstance. dr. flint loved money, but he loved power more. after much discussion, my friend

and was glad to be sold. she had no mother, and no near ties. she had been torn from all her family years before. a few friends had entered into bonds for her safety, if the trader would allow her to spend with them the time that intervened between

page 125
her sale and the gathering up of his human stock. such a favor was rarely granted. it saved the trader the expense of board and jail fees, and though the amount was small, it was a weighty consideration in a slave-trader's mind.

        dr. flint always had an aversion to meeting slaves after he had sold them. he ordered rose out of the house; but he was no longer her master, and she took no notice of him. for once the crushed rose was the conqueror. his gray eyes flashed angrily upon her; but that was the extent of his power. "how came this girl here?" he exclaimed. "what right had you to allow it, when you knew i had sold her?"

        i answered "this is my grandmother's house, and rose came to see her. i have no right to turn any b

        he threw the birth of my children in her face, and accused her of sanctioning the life i was leading. she told him i was living with her by compulsion of his wife; that he needn't accuse her, for he was the one to blame; he was the one who had caused all the

page 126
trouble. she grew more and more excited as she went on. "i tell you what, dr. flint," said she, "you ain't got many more years to live, and you'd better be saying your prayers. it will take 'em all, and more too, to wash the dirt off your soul."

        "do you know whom you are talking to?" he exclaimed.

        she replied, "yes, i know very well who i am talking to."

        he left the house in a great rage. i looked at my grandmother. our eyes met. their angry expression had passed away, but she looked sorrowful and weary—weary of incessant strife. i wondered that it

        back came the wily doctor. i was not at home when he called. a friend had invited me to a small party, and to gratify her i went. to my great consternation, a messenger came in haste to say that dr. flint was at my grandmother's, and insisted on seeing me. they did not tell him where i was, or he would have come

power, and the prospect was apalling. even if i should kneel before him, and implore him to spare me, for the sake of my children, i knew he would spurn me with his foot, and my weakness would be his triumph.

        before the week expired, i heard that young mr. flint was about to be married to a lady of his own stamp. i foresaw the position i should occupy in his establishment. i had once been sent to the plantation for punishment, and fear of the son had induced the father to recall me very soon. my mind was made up; i was resolved that i would foil my master and save my children, or i would perish in the attempt. i kept my plans to myself; i knew that friends would try to dissuade me from them, and i would not wound their feelings by rejecting their advic

was made within my hearing, and it would have been quite as manly to have made it to my face. he had said things to my face which might, or might not, have surprised his neighbor if he had known of them. he was "a chip of the old block."

        i wished to appear as contented as possible. sometimes i had an opportunity to send a few lines home; and this brought up recollections that made it difficult, for a time, to seem calm and indifferent to my lot. notwithstanding my efforts, i saw that mr. flint regarded me with a suspicious eye. ellen broke down under the trials of her new life. separated from me, with no one to look after her, she wandered about, and in a few days cried herself sick. one day, she sat under the window where i was at work, crying that weary cry which makes a mother's heart bleed. i was obliged to steel myself to bear it. after a while it ceased. i looked out, and she was gone. as it was near noon, i ventured to go down in search of her. the great house was raised two f

        the next morning the old cart was loaded with shingles for town. i put ellen into it, and sent her to her grandmother. mr. flint said i ought to have as

        mr. flint often took an inspection of the house, to see that no one was idle. the entire management of the work was trusted to me, because he knew nothing about it; and rather than hire a superintendent he contented himself with my arrangements. he had

 cows, and the fresh cream was miss fanny's delight. she invariably declared that it was the best in town. the old ladies had cosey times together. they would work and chat, and sometimes, while talking over old times, their spectacles would get dim with tears, and would have to be taken off and wiped. when miss fanny bade us good by, her bag was filled with grandmother's best cakes, and she was urged to come again soon.

        there had been a time when dr. flint's wife came to take tea with us, and when her children were also sent to have a feast of "aunt marthy's" nice cooking. but after i became an object of her jealousy and spite, she was angry with grandmother for giving a shelter to me and my children. she would not even speak to her in the street. this wounded my grandmother's feelings, for she could not retain ill will against the

intercourse with miss fanny if she could have done it, but fortunately she was not dependent on the bounty of the flints. she had enough to be independent; and that is more than can ever be gained from charity, however lavish it may be.

        miss fanny was endeared to me by many recollections, and i was rejoiced to see her at the plantation. the warmth of her large, loyal heart made the house seem pleasanter while she was in it. she staid a week, and i had many talks with her. she said her principal object in coming was to see how i was treated, and whether any thing could be done for me. she inquired whethe

for freedom. though the boon would have been precious to me, above all price, i would not have taken it at the expense of leaving them in slavery. every trial i endured, every sacrifice i made for their sakes, drew them closer to my heart, and gave me fresh courage to beat back the dark waves that rolled and rolled ov

pity than they would bestow on those of a horse or a dog.

        all passed off smoothly for me until dinner time arrived. i did not mind the embarrassment of waiting on a dinner party, for the first time in my life, half so much as i did the meeting with dr. flint and his wife, who would be among the guests. it was a mystery to me why mrs. flint had not made her appearance at the plantation during all the time i was putting the house in order. i had not met her, face to face, fo

on planks before the meat house. then the second foreman went behind the building, and when the first foreman called out, "who takes this piece of meat?" he answered by calling somebody's name. this method was resorted to as a means of preventing partiality in distributing the meat. the young mistress came out to see how things were done on her plantation, and she soon gave a specimen of her character. among those in waiting for their allowance was a very old slave, who had faithfully served the flint family through three generations. when he hobbled up to get his bit of meat, the mistress said he was too old to have any allowance; that when niggers were too old to work, they ought to be fed on grass. poor old man! he suffered much before he found rest in the grave.

        mr. flint was hard pushed for house servants, and rather than lose me he had restrained his malice. i did my work faithfully, though not, of course, with a willing mind. they were evidently afraid i should leave them. mr. flint wished that i should sleep in the great house instead of the servants' quarters. his wife agreed to the proposition, but said i mustn't bring my bed into the house, because it would scatter feathers on her carpet. i knew when i went there that they would never think of such a thin

"you have had time enough to do it," said he. "take care how you answer me!"
        i shut all the windows, locked all the doors, and went up to the third story, to wait till midnight. how

        i told her i had a hiding-place, and that was all it was best for her to know. i asked her to go into my room as soon as it was light, and take all my clothes out of my trunk, and pack them in hers; for i knew mr. flint and the constable would be there early to search my room. i feared the sight of my children would be too much for my full heart; but i could not go out into the uncertain future without one last look. i bent over the bed where lay my little benny and baby ellen. poor little ones! fatherless and motherless! memories of their father came over me. he wanted to be kind to them; but they were not all to him, as they were to my womanly heart. i knelt and prayed for the innocent little sleepers. i kis

        i went forth into the darkness and rain. i ran on till i came to the house of the friend who was to conceal me.

        early the next morning mr. flint was at my grandmother's

        the search for me was kept up with more perseverence than i had anticipated. i began to think that escape was impossible. i was in great anxiety lest i should implicate the friend who harbored me. i knew the consequences would be frightful; and much as i dreaded being caught, even that seemed better than causing an innocent person to suffer for kindness to me. a week had passed in terrible suspense, when my pursuers came into such close vicinity tha

 in my throat; but i could have kissed the feet of my benefactress. for that deed of christian womanhood may god forever bless her!

        i went to sleep that night with the feeling that i was for the present the most fortunate slave in town. morning came and filled my little cell with light. i thanked the heavenly father for this safe retreat. opposite my window was a pile of feather beds. on the top of these i could lie perfectly concealed, and command a view of the street through which dr. flint passed to his office. anxious as i was, i felt a gleam of satisfaction when i saw him. thus far i had outwitted him, and i triumphed over it. who can blame slaves for being cunning? they are constantly compelled to resort to it. it is the only weapon of the weak and oppressed against the strength of their tyrants.

        i was daily hoping to hear that my master had sold my children; for i knew who was on the watch to buy them. but dr. flint cared even more for revenge than he did for money.

        poor william! he also must suffer for being my brother. i took his advice and kept quiet. my aunt was taken out of jail at the end of a month, because mrs. flint could not spare her any longer. she was tired of being her own housekeeper. it was quite too fatiguing to order her dinner and eat it too. my children remained in jail, where brother william did all he could for their comfort. betty went to see them sometimes, and brought me tidings. she was not permitted to enter the jail; but william would hold them up to the grated window while she chatted with them. when she repeated their prattle, and told me how they

 to clasp their arms round her neck; she had never seen their soft eyes looking into hers; no sweet little voices had called her mother; she had never pressed her own infants to her heart, with the feeling that even in fetters there was something to live for. how could she realize my feelings? betty's husband loved children dearly, and wondered why god had denied them to him. he expressed great sorrow when he came to betty with the tidings that ellen had been taken out of jail and carried to dr. flint's. she had the measles a short time before they carried her to jail, and the disease had left her eyes affected. the doctor had taken her home to attend to them. my children had always been afraid of the doctor and his wife. they had never been inside of their house. poor little ellen cried all day to be carried back to prison. the instincts of childhood are true. she knew she was loved in the jail. her screams and sobs annoyed mrs. flint. before night she called one of the slaves, and said, "h

        when these remarks were reported to me, i smiled at mrs. flint's saying that she should either kill my child or spoil her. i thought to myself there was very little danger of the latter. i have always considered it as one of god's special providences that ellen screamed till was carried back to jail.

        that same night, dr. flint was called to a patient, and did not return till near morning. passing my grandmother's, he saw a light in the house, and thought to himself, "perhaps this has something to do with linda." he knocked and the door was opened.

        some days after this adventure i had a much worse

fright. as i sat very still in my retreat above stairs, cheerful visions floated through my mind. i thought dr. flint would soon get discouraged, and would be willing to sell my children, when he lost all hopes of making them the means of my discovery. i knew who was ready to buy them. suddenly i heard a voice that chilled my blood. the sound was too familiar to me, it had been too dreadful, for me not to recognize at once my old master. he was in the house, and i at once concluded that he had come to seize me. i looked round in terror. there was no way of escape. the voice receded. i supposed the constable wa

        when the wagon stopped at the hotel, several gentlemen came out and proposed to purchase william, but the trader refused their offers, without stating that he was already sold. and now came the trying hour for that drove of human beings, driven away like cattle, to be sold they knew not where. husbands were torn from wives, parents from children, never to look upon each other again this side the grave. there was wringing of hands and cries of despair.

        dr. flint had the supreme satisfaction of seeing the wagon leave town, and mrs. flint had the gratification of supposing that my children were going "as far as wind and water would carry them." according to the agreement, my uncle followed the wagon some miles, until they came to an old farm house. there the trader took the irons from william, and as he did so, he said, "you are a damned clever fellow. i should like to own you myself. them gentlemen that wanted to buy you said you was a bright, honest ch

        much as i despise and detest the class of slave-traders, whom i regard as the vilest wretches on earth, i must do this man the justice to say that he seemed to have some feeling. he took a fancy to william in the jail, and wanted to buy him. when he heard the story of my children, he was willing to aid them in getting out of dr. flint's power, even without charging the customary fee.

        my uncle procured a wagon and carried william and the children back to town. great was the joy in my grandmother's house! the curtains were closed, and the candles lighted. the happy grandmother cuddled the little ones to her bosom. they hugged her, and kissed her, and clapped their hands, and shouted. she knelt down and poured forth one of her heartfelt prayers of thanksgiving to god. the father was present for awhile; and though such

        at dawn, betty was up and off to the kitchen. the hours passed on, and the vision of the night kept constantly recurring to my thought. after a while i heard the voices of two women in the entry. in one of them i recognized the housemaid. the other said to her, "did you know linda brent's children was sold to the speculator yesterday. they say ole massa flint was mighty glad to see 'em drove out of town; but they say they've come back agin. i 'spect it's all their daddy's doings. they say he's bought william too. lor! how it will take hold of ole massa flint! i'm going roun' to aunt marthy's to see 'bout it."

        i bit my lips till the blood came to keep from crying out. were my children with their grandmother, or had the speculator carried them off? the suspense was dreadful. would betty never come, and tell me the truth about it? at last she

        the news of his arrest was carried to my grandmother, who conveyed it to betty. in the kindness of her heart, she again stowed me away under the floor; and as she walked back and forth, in the performance of her culinary duties, she talked apparently to herself, but with the intention that i should hear what was going on. i hoped that my uncle's imprisonment would last but few days; still i was anxious. i thought it likely that dr. flint would do his utmost to taunt and insult him, and i was afraid my uncle might lose control of himself, and retort in some way that would be construed into a punishable offence; and i was well aware that in court his word would not be taken against any white man's. the search for me

        my condition was now a little improved. but for weeks i was tormented by hundreds of little red insects, fine as a needle's point, that pierced through my skin, and

        benny ran terrified into the house, saying, "you can't put me in jail again. i don't belong to you now." it was well that the wind carried the words away from the doctor's ear. i told my grandmother of it, when we had our next conference at the trap-door; and begged of her not to allow the c

        dr. flint and his family repeatedly tried to coax and bribe my children to tell something they had heard said about me. one day the doctor took them into a shop, and offered them some bright little silver pieces and gay handkerchiefs if they would tell where their mother was. ellen shrank away from him, and would not speak; but benny spoke up, and said, "dr. flint, i don't know where my mother is. i guess she's in new york; and when you go there again, i wish you'd ask her to come home, for i want to see

        i had directed that my letters should be put into the new york post office on the 20th of the

 month. on that evening of the 24th my aunt came to say that dr. flint and his wife had been talking in a low voice about a letter he had received, and that when he went to his office he promised to bring it when he came to tea. so i concluded i should hear my letter read the next morning. i told my grandmother dr. flint would be sure to come, and asked her to have him sit near a certain door, and leave it open, that i might hear what he said. the next morning i took my station within sound of that door, and remained motionless as a statue. it was not long before i heard the gate slam, and the well-known footsteps enter the house. he seated himself in the chair that was placed for him, and said, "well, martha, i've brought you a letter from linda. she has sent me a letter also. i know exactly where to find her;

        "pretty well, sir," she replied. "i heard you tell grandmother that my mother is coming home. i want to see her."

        "yes, ellen, i am going to bring her home very soon," rejoiced he; "and you shall see her as much as you like, you little curly-headed nigger."

        this was as good as a comedy to me, who had heard it all; but grandmother was frightened and distressed, because the doctor wanted my uncle to go for me.

        the next evening dr. flint called to talk the matter over. my uncle told him that from what he had heard of massachusetts, he judged he should be mobbed if he went there after a runaway slave. "all stuff and nonsense, phillip!" replied the doctor. "do you suppose i want you to kick up a row in boston? the business can all be done quietly. linda writes that she wants to come back. you are her relative, and she would trust you. the case would be different if i went. she might object to coming with me; and the damned abolit

        "don't worry yourself, grandmother," said i. "the mayor of boston won't trouble himself to hunt niggers for dr. flint. the letters will do good in the end. i shall get out of this dark hole some time or other."

        the fact that dr. flint had written to the mayor of boston convinced me that he believed my letter to be genuine, and of course that he had no suspicion of my being any where in the vicinity. it was a great object to keep up this delusion, for it made me and my friends feel less anxious, and it would be very convenient whenever there was a chance to escape. i resolved, therefore, to continue to write letters from the north from time to time.

arrangements in his favor. he had too often known such accidents to happen to slaves who had kind masters, and he wisely resolved to make sure of the present opportunity to own himself. he was scrupulous about taking any money from his master on false pretences; so he sold his best clothes to pay for his passage to boston. the slaveholders pronounced him a base, ungrateful wretch, for thus requiting his master's indulgence. what would they have done under similar circumstances?

        when dr. flint's family heard that william had deserted mr. sands, they chuckled greatly over the news. mrs. flint made her usual manifestations of christian feeling, by saying, "i'm glad of it. i hope he'll never get him again. i like to see people paid back in their own coin. i reckon linda's children will have to pay for it. i should be glad to see them in the speculator's hands again, for i'm tired of seeing those little niggers march about the streets."

        so, then, after all i had endured for their sakes, my poor children were between two fires; between my old master and their new master! and i was powerless. there was no protecting arm of the law for me to invoke. mr. sands proposed that ellen should go, for the present, to some of his relatives, who had removed to broo

        i answered, "i couldn't come before, dear. but now that i am with you, tell me whether you like to go away." "i don't know," said she, crying. "grandmother says i ought not to cry; that i am going to a good place, where i can learn to read and write, and that by and by i can write her a letter. but i shan't have benny, or grandmother, or uncle phillip, or any body to love me. can't you go with me? o, do go, dear mother!"

        dr. flint's family knew nothing of the proposed arrangement till after ellen was gone, and the news

displeased them greatly. mrs. flint called on mrs. sands's sister to inquire into the matter. she expressed her opinion very freely as to the respect mr. sands's showed for his wife, and for his own character, in acknowledging those "young niggers." and as for sending ellen away, she pronounced it to be just as much stealing as it would be for him to come and take a piece of furniture out of her

aunt nancy.

        i have mentioned my great-aunt, who was a slave in dr. flint's family, and who had been my refuge during the shameful persecutions i suffered from him. this aunt had been married at twenty years of age; that is, as far as slaves can marry. she had the consent of her master and mistress, and a clergyman performed the ceremony. but it was a mere form, without any legal value. her master or mistress could annul it any day they pleased. she had always slept on the floor in the entry, near mrs. flint's chamber door, that she might be within call. when she was

 married, she was told that she might have the use of a small room in an outhouse. her mother and her husband furnished it. he was a seafaring man, and was allowed to sleep there when he was at home. but on the wedding evening, the bride was ordered to her old post on the entry floor.
        mrs flint, at that time, had no children; but she was expecting to be a mother, and if she should want a drink of water in the night, what could she do without her slave to bring it? so my aunt was compelled to lie at her door, until one midnight she was forced to leave, to give premature birth to a child. in a fortnight she was required to resume her place on the entry floor, because mrs. flint's babe needed her attentions. she kept her station there through the summer and winter, until she had given pr

and all the while she was employed as night-nurse to mr. flint's children. finally, toiling all day, and being deprived of rest at night, completely broke down her constitution, and dr. flint declared it was impossible she could ever become the mother of a living child. the fear of losing so valuable a servant by death, now induced them to allow her to sleep in her little room in the out-house, except when there was sickness in the family. she afterwards had two feeble babes, one of whom died in a few days, and the other in four weeks. i well remember her patient sorrow as she held the last dead baby in her arms.

        aunt nancy was housekeeper and waiting-maid in dr. flint's family. indeed, she was the factotum of the household. nothing went on well without her. she was my mother's twin sister, and, as far as was in her power, she supplied a mother's place to us orphans. i slept with her all the time i lived in my old master's house, and the bond between us was very strong. when my friends tried to discourage me from running away, she always encouraged me. when they thought i had better return and ask my master's pardon, because there was no possibility of escape

        i had been in my cell six years when my grandmother was summoned to the bedside of this, her last remaining daughter. she was very ill, and they said she would die. grandmother had not entered dr. flint's house for several years. they had treated her cruelly, but she thought nothing of that now. she was grateful for permission to watch by the death-bed of her child. they had always been devoted to each other; and now they sat looking into each other's eyes, longing to speak of the secret that had weighed so much on them both. my aunt had been stricken with paralysis. she lived two days, and the last day she was speechless. before she lost the power of utterance, she told her mother not to grie

i opened my eyes and found uncle phillip bending over me. i had no need to ask any questions. he whispered, "linda, she died happy." i could not weep. my fixed gaze troubled him. "don't look so," he said. "don't add to my poor mother's trouble. remember how much she has to bear, and that we ought to do all we can to comfort her." ah, yes, that blessed old grandmother, who for seventy-three years had borne the pelting storms of a slave-mother's life. she did indeed need consolation!

        mrs. flint had rendered her poor foster-sister childless, apparently without any compunction; and with cruel selfishness had ruined her health by years of incessant, unrequited toil, and broken rest. but now she became very sentimental. i suppose she thought it would be a beautiful illustration of the attachment existing between slaveholder and slave, if the body of her old worn-out servant was buried at her feet. she sent for the clergyman and asked if he had any objection to burying aunt nancy in the do

ctor's family burial place. no colored person had ever been allowed interment in the white people's burying-ground, and the minister knew that all the deceased of our family reposed together in the old graveyard of the slaves. he therefore replied, "i have no objection to complying with your wish; but perhaps aunt nancy's mother may have some choice as to where her remains shall be deposited."

page 222
        it had never occurred to mrs. flint that slaves could have any feelings. when my grandmother was consulted, she at once said she wanted nancy to lie with all the rest of her family, and where her own old body would be buried. mrs. flint graciously complied with her wish, though she said it was painful to her to have nancy buried away from her. she might have added with touching pathos, "i was so long used to sleep with her lying near me, on the entry floor."

 expense; and slaveholders are always ready to grant such favors to slaves and their relatives. the arrangements were very plain, but perfectly respectable. she was buried on the sabbath, and mrs. flint's minister read the funeral service. there was a large concourse of colored people, bond and free, and a few white persons who had always been friendly to our family. dr. flint's carriage was in the procession; and when the body was deposited in its humble resting place, the mistress dropped a tear, and returned to her carriage, probably thinking she had performed her duty nobly.

        it was talked of by the slaves as a mighty grand funeral. northern travellers, passing through the place, might have described this tribute of respect to the humble dead as a beautiful feature in the "patriarchal institution;" a touching proof of the attachment between slaveholders a

 my friend peter came one evening, and asked to speak with me. "your day has come, linda," said he. "i have found a chance for you to go to the free states. you have a fortnight to decide." the news seemed too good to be true; but peter explained his arrangements, and told me all that was necessary was for me to say i would go. i was going to answer him with a joyful yes, when the thought of benny came to my mind. i told him the temptation was exceedingly strong, but i was terribly afraid of dr. flint's alleged power over my child, and that i could not go and leave him behind. peter remonstrated earnestly. he said such a good chance might never occur again; that benny was free, and could be sent to me; and that for the sake of my children's welfare i ought not to hesitate a moment. i told him i would consult with uncle phillip. my uncle rejoiced in the plan, and bade me to go by all means. he promised, if his life was spared, that he would either bring or send my son to me as soon as i reach

   the anticipation of being a free woman proved almost too much for my weak frame. the excitement stimulated me, and at the same time bewildered me. i made busy preparations for my journey, and for my son to follow me. i resolved to have an interview with him before i went, that i might give him cautions and advice, and tell him how anxiously i should be waiting for him at the north. grandmother stole up to me as often as possible to whisper words of counsel. she insisted upon my writing to dr. flint, as soon as i arrived in the free states, and asking him to sell me to her. she said she would sacrifice her house, and all she had in the world, for the sake of having me safe with my children in any part of the world. if she could only live to know that she could die in peace. i promised the dear old faithful friend that i would write to her as soon as i arrived, and put the letter in a safe way to reach her; but in my own mind i resolved that not another cent of her hard earnings should be s

"poor child!" she exclaimed, "my carelessness has ruined you. the boat ain't gone yet. get ready immediately, and go with fanny. i ain't got another word to say against it now; for there's no telling what may happen this day."

        uncle phillip was sent for, and he agreed with his mother in thinking that jenny would inform dr. flint

        the captain agreed to wait at a certain place till evening, being handsomely paid for his detention.

        of course, the day was an anxious one for us all. but we concluded that if jenny had seen me, she would be too wise to let her mistress know of it; and that she probably would not get a chance to see dr. flint's family till evening, for i knew very well what were the rules in that household. i afterwards believed that she did not see me; for nothing ever came of it, and she was one of those base characters that would have jumped to betray a suffering fellow being for the sake of thirty pieces of silver.

        i asked him if he ever mentioned his suspicions to his sister. he said he never did; but after he heard the cough, if he saw her playing with other children on that side of the house, he always tried to coax her round to the other side, for fear they would hear me cough, too. he said he had kept a close lookout for dr. flint, and if he saw him speak to a constable, or a patrol, he always told grandmother. i now recollected that i had seen him manifest uneasiness, when people were on that side of the house, and i had at the time been puzzled to conjecture a motive for his actions. such prudence may seem extraordinary in a boy of twelve years, but slaves, being surrounded by mysteries, deceptions, and dangers, early learn to be

        i returned to my friend's house in an uneasy state of mind. in order to protect my children, it was necessary that i should own myself. i called myself free, and sometimes felt so; but i knew i was insecure. i sat down that night and wrote a civil letter to dr. flint, asking him to state the lowest terms on which he would sell me; and as i belonged by law to his daughter, i wrote to her also, making a similar request.

        since my arrival at the north i had not been unmindful of my dear brother william. i had made diligent inquiries for him, and having heard of him in boston, i went thither. when i arrived there, i found he had gone to new bedford. i wrote to that place, and was informed he had gone on a whaling voyage, and would not return for some mo

the old enemy again.

        my young mistress, miss emily flint, did not return any answer to my letter requesting her to consent to my being sold. but after a while, i received a reply, which purported to be written by her younger brother. in order rightly to enjoy the contents of this letter, the reader must bear in mind that the flint family supposed i had been at the north many years. they had no idea that i knew of the doctor's three excursions to new york in search of me; that i had heard his voice, when he came to borrow five hundred dollars for that

any person you may choose in our community. you will please answer this as soon as possible, and let us know your decision. sister sends much love to you. in the mean time believe me your sincere friend and well wisher."

        this letter was signed by emily's brother, who was as yet a mere lad. i knew, by the style, that it was not written by a person of his age, and though the writing was disguised, i had been made too unhappy by it, in former years, not to recognize at once the hand of dr. flint. o, the hypocrisy of slaveholders! did the old fox suppose i was goose enough to go into such a trap? verily, he relied too much on "the stupidity of the african race." i did not return the family of flints any thanks for their cordial invitation—a remissness for which i was, no doubt, charged with base ingratitude.

        not long afterwards i received a letter from one of my friends at the south, informing me that dr. flint was about to visit the north. the letter had been delayed, and i

        i did not like to tell the sanguine, happy little fellow how much he was mistaken. i took him to a tailor, and procured a change of clothes. the rest of the day was spent in mutual asking and answering of questions, with the wish constantly repeated that the good old grandmother was with us, and frequent injunctions from benny to write to her immediately, and be sure to tell her every thing about his voyage, and his journey to boston.

        dr. flint made his visit to new york, and made every exertion to call upon me, and invite me to return with him; but not being able to ascertain where i was, his hospitable intentions were frustrated, and the affectionate family, who were waiting for me with "open arms," were doomed to disappointment.

        as soon as i knew he was safely at home, i placed benjamin in the care of my brother william, and returned to mrs. bruce. there i remained through the winter and spring, endeavoring to perform my d

 that mr. thorne's intemperance was not the only annoyance she suffered from him. though he professed too much gratitude to my grandmother to injure any of her descendants, he had poured vile language into the ears of her innocent great-grandchild.

        i usually went to brooklyn to spend sunday afternoon. one sunday, i found ellen anxiously waiting for me near the house. "o, mother," said she, "i've

been waiting for you this long time. i'm afraid mr. thorne has written to tell dr. flint where you are. make haste and come in. mrs. hobbs will tell you all about it!"

        the story was soon told. while the children were playing in the grape-vine arbor, the day before, mr. thorne came out with a letter in his hand, which he tore up and scattered about. ellen was sweeping the yard at the time, and having her mind full of suspicions of him, she picked up the pieces and carried them to the children, saying, "i wonder who mr. thorne has been writing to."

        it was evident that i had no time to lose; and i hastened back to the city with a heavy heart. again i was to be torn from a comfortable home, and all my plans for the welfare of my children were to be frustrated by that demon slavery! i now regr

        my visit to england is a memorable event in my life, from the fact of my having there received strong religious impressions. the contemptuous manner in which the communion had been administered to colored people, in my native place; the church membership of dr. flint, and others like him; and the buying and selling of slaves, by professed ministers of the gospel, had given me a prejudice against the episcopal church. the whole service seemed to me a mockery and a sham. but my home in steventon was in the family of a clergyman, who was a true disciple of jesus. the beauty of his daily life inspired me with faith in the gentleness of christian professions. grace entered my heart, and i knelt at the communion table, i trust, in true humility of soul.

        not long after my return, i received the following letter from miss emily flint, now mrs. dodge:—

        "in this you will recognize the hand of your friend and mistress. having heard that you had gone with a family to europe, i have waited to hear of your return to write to you. i should have answered the letter you wrote to me long since, but as i could not then act independently of my father, i knew there could be nothing done satisfactory to you. there were persons here who were willing to buy you and run the risk of getting you. to this i would not consent. i have

        of course i did not write to return thanks for this cordial invitation. i felt insulted to be thought stupid enough to be caught by such professions.

                        " 'come up into my parlor,' said the spider to the fly;

        it was plain that dr. flint's family were apprised of my movements, since they knew of my voyage to europe. i expected to have further trouble from them; but having eluded them thus far, i hoped to be as successful in future. the money i had earned, i was desirous to devote to the education of my children, and to secure a home for them. it seemed not only hard, but unjust, to pay for myself. i could not possibly regard myself as a piece of property. moreover, i had worked many years without wages, and during that time had

 been obliged to depend on my grandmother for many comforts in food and clothing. my children certainly belonged to me; but though dr. flint had incurred no expense for their support, he had received a large sum of money for them. i knew the law would decide that i was his property, and would probably still give his daughter a claim to my children; but i regarded such laws as the regulations of robbers, who had no rights that i was bound to respect.

        all that winter i lived in a state of anxiety. when i took the children out to breathe the air, i closely observed the countenances of all i met. i dreaded the approach of summer, when snakes and slaveholders make their appearance. i was, in fact, a slave in new york, as subject to slave laws as i had been in a slave state. strange incongruity in a state called free!

        spring returned, and i received warning from the

south that dr. flint knew of my return to my old place, and was making preparations to have me caught. i learned afterwards that my dress, and that of mrs. bruce's children, had been described to him by some of the northern tools, which slaveholders employ for their base purposes, and then indulge in sneers at their cupidity and mean servility.

        these letters both cheered and saddened me. i was always glad to have tidings from the kind, faithful old friend of my unhappy youth; but her messages of love made my heart yearn to see her before she died, and i mourned over the fact that it was impossible. some months after i returned from my flight to new england, i received a letter from her, in which she wrote, "dr. flint is dead. he has left a distressed family. poor old man! i hope he made his peace with god."

        i remembered how he had defrauded my grandmother of the hard earnings she had loaned; how he had tried to cheat her out of the freedom her mistress had promised her, and how he had persecuted her children; and i thought to myself that she was a better christian than i was, if she could entirely forgive him. i cannot say, with truth, that the news of my old master's death softened my feelings tow

        his departure from this world did not diminish my danger. he had threatened my grandmother that his heirs should hold me in slavery after he was gone; that i never should be free so long as a child of his survived. as for mrs. flint, i had seen her in deeper afflictions than i supposed the loss of her husband would be, for she had buried several children; yet i never saw any signs of softening in her heart. the doctor had died in embarrassed circumstances, and had

page 295
little to will to his heirs, except such property as he was unable to grasp. i was well aware what i had to expect from the family of flints; and my fears were confirmed by a letter from the south, warning me to be on my guard, because mrs. flint openly

        "do you know where she went?"

        "i do not, sir." and the door was closed.

        this mr. dodge, who claimed me as his property, was originally a yankee pedler in the south; then he became a merchant, and finally a slaveholder. he managed to get introduced into what was called the first society, and married miss emily flint. a quarrel arose between him and her brother, and the brother cowhided him. this led to a family feud, and he proposed to remove to virginia. dr. flint left him no property, and his own means had become circumscribed, while a wife and children depended upon him for support. under these circumstances, it was very natural that he should make an effort to put me into his pocket.

        "your arrival was published in the evening papers, sir; and i called to ask mrs. dodge about my friends at home. i didn't suppose it would give any offence."

        "yes, sir, i've seen her, and know where she is. she is out of your reach, sir."

        "tell me where she is, or bring her to me, and i will give her a chance to buy her freedom."
