s is a story of how a baggins 

had an adventure, found himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected. he may 
have lost the neighbours' respect, but he gained-well, you will see whether he gained 
anything in the end. 
the mother of our particular hobbit ... what is a hobbit? i suppose hobbits need some 
description nowadays, since they have become rare and shy of the big people, as they 
call us. they are (or were) a little people, about half our height, and smaller than the 
bearded dwarves. hobbits have no beards. 
there is little or no magic about them, except the ordinary everyday sort which helps 
them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come 
blundering along, making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off. they are 
inclined to be at in the stomach; they dress in bright colours (chiefly green and yellow); 
wear no shoes, because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown hair 
like the stuff on their heads (w

seed-cakes which he had baked that afternoon for his after-supper morsel. 
when he got back balin and dwalin were talking at the table like old friends (as a matter 
of fact they were brothers). bilbo plumped down the beer and the cake in front of them, 
when loud came a ring at the bell again, and then another ring. 
"gandalf for certain this time," he thought as he puffed along the passage. but it was 
not. it was two more dwarves, both with blue hoods, silver belts, and yellow beards; and 
each of them carried a bag of tools and a spade. 
in they hopped, as soon as the door began to open-bilbo was hardly surprised at all. 
"what can i do for you, my dwarves?" he said. "kili at your service!" said the one. "and 
fili!" added the other; and they both swept off their blue hoods and bowed. 
"at yours and your family's!" replied bilbo, remembering his manners this time. 
"dwalin and balin here already, i see," said kili. "le

t us join the throng!" 
"throng!" thought mr. baggins. "i don't like the sound of that. i really must sit down for a 
minute and collect my wits, and have a drink." he had only just had a sip-in the corner, 
while the four dwarves sat around the table, and talked about mines and gold and 
troubles with the goblins, and the depredations of dragons, and lots of other things which 
he did not understand, and did not want to, for they sounded much too adventurous-
when, ding-dong-aling-' dang, his bell rang again, as if some naughty little hobbit-boy 
was trying to pull the handle off. "someone at the door!" he said, blinking. "some four, i 
should say by the sound," said fili. "be-sides, we saw them coming along behind us i

, and gloin were their names; and very soon two purple 
hoods, a grey hood, a brown hood, and a white hood were hanging on the pegs, and off 
they marched with their broad hands stuck in their gold and silver belts to join the others. 
already it had almost become a throng. some called for ale, and some for porter, and 
one for coffee, and all of them for cakes; so the hobbit was kept very busy for a while. 
a big jug of coffee bad just been set in the hearth, the seed-cakes were gone, and the 
dwarves were starting on a round of buttered scones, when there came-a loud knock. 
not a ring, but a hard rat-tat on the hobbit's beautiful green door. somebody was 
banging with a stick! 
bilbo rushed along the passage, very angry, and altogether bewildered and bewuthered-
this was the most awkward wednesday he ever remembered. he pulled open the door 
with a jerk, and they all fell in, one on top of the other. more dwarves, four more! and 
there was gandalf behind, leaning on his staff and laughing.

ing at the row of thirteen hoods-the best 
detachable party hoods-and his own hat hanging on the pegs. 
"quite a merry gathering! 
i hope there is something left for the late-comers to eat and drink! 
what's that? tea! no thank you! a little red wine, i think, for me." "and for me," said 
thorin. "and raspberry jam and apple-tart," said bifur. "and mincepies and cheese," said 
bofur. "and pork-pie and salad," said bombur. "and more cakes-and ale-and coffee, if 
you don't mind," called the other dwarves through the door. 
"put on a few eggs, there's a good fellow!" gandalf called after him, as the hobbit 
stumped off to the pantries. "and just bring out the cold chicken and pickles!" 
"seems to know as much about the inside of my larders as i do myself!" thought mr. 
baggins, who was feeling positively flummoxed, and was beginning to wonder whether a 
most wretched adventure had not come right into his house. 
by the time he had got all the bottles and dishes and knives and forks and glasses a

plates and spoons and things piled up on big trays, he was getting very hot, and red in 
the face, and annoyed. 
"confusticate and bebother these dwarves!" he said aloud. "why don't they come and 
lend a hand?" lo and behold! there stood balin and dwalin at the door of the kitchen, 
and fili and kili behind them, and before he could say knife they had whisked the trays 
and a couple of small tables into the parlour and set out everything afresh. 
gandalf sat at the head of the party with the thirteen, dwarves all round: and bilbo sat on 
a stool at the fireside, nibbling at a biscuit (his appetite was quite taken away), and trying 
to look as if

 this was all perfectly ordinary and. not in the least an adventure. the 
dwarves ate and ate, and talked and talked, and time got on. at last they pushed their 
chairs back, and bilbo made a move to collect the plates and glasses. 
"i suppose you will all stay to supper?" he said in his politest unpressing tones. "of 
course!" said thorin. "and after. we shan't get through the business till late, and we 
must have some music first. now to clear up!" 
thereupon the twelve dwarves-not thorin, he was too important, and stayed talking to 
gandalf-jumped to their feet and made tall piles of all the things. 
off they went, not waiting for trays, balancing columns of plates, each with a bottle on 
the top, with one hand, while the hobbit ran after them almost squeaking with fright: 
"please be careful!" and "please, don't trouble! i can manage." but the dwarves only 
started to sing: 
 
"chip the glasses and crack the plates! 
blunt the knives and bend the forks!

the dark came into the room from the little window that opened in the side of the hill; 
the firelight flickered-it was april-and still they played on, while the shadow of gandalf's 
beard wagged against the wall. 
the dark filled all the room, and the fire died down, and the shadows were lost, and still 
they played on. and suddenly first one and then another began to sing as they played, 
deep-throated singing of the dwarves in the deep places of their ancient homes; and this 
is like a fragment of their song, if it can be like their song without their music. 
 
"far over the misty mountains cold 
to dungeons deep and caverns old 
we must away ere break of day 
to seek the pale enchanted gold. 
the dwarves of yore made mighty spells, 
while hammers fell like ringing bells 
in places deep, where dark things sleep, 
in hollow halls beneath the fells.

hey carved there for themselves 
and harps of gold; where no man delves 
there lay they long, and many a song 
was sung unheard by men or elves. 
the pines were roaring on the height, 
the winds were moaning in the night. 
the fire was red, it flaming spread; 
the trees like torches biased with light, 
the bells were ringing in the dale 
and men looked up with faces pale; 
the dragon's ire more fierce than fire 
laid low their towers and houses frail. 
the mountain smoked beneath the moon; 
the dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom. 
they fled their hall to dying -fall 
beneath his feet, beneath the moon. 
far over the misty mountains grim 
to dungeons deep and caverns dim 
we must away, ere break of day,

as they sang the hobbit felt the love of beautiful things made by hands and by cunning 
and by magic moving through him, a fierce and jealous love, the desire of the hearts of 
dwarves. then something tookish woke up inside him, and he wished to go an

he looked out of the window. the stars were out in a dark sky above the trees. he 
thought of the jewels of the dwarves shining in dark caverns. 
suddenly in the wood beyond the water a flame leapt up--probably somebody lighting a 
wood-fire-and he thought of plundering dragons settling on his quiet hill and kindling it all 
to flames. he shuddered; and very quickly he was plain mr. baggins of bag-end, under-
hill, again. 
he got up trembling. he had less than half a mind to fetch the lamp, and more than half 
a mind to pretend to, and go and hide behind the beer barrels in the cellar, and not come

til all the dwarves had gone away. 
suddenly he found that the music and the singing had stopped, and they were all looking 
at him with eyes shining in the dark. 
"where are you going?" said thorin, in a tone that seemed to show that he 
guessed both halves of the hobbit's mind. 
"what about a little light?" said bilbo apologetically. 
"we like the dark," said the dwarves. "dark for dark business! there are many hours 
before dawn." 
"of course!" said bilbo, and sat down in a hurry. he missed the stool and sat in the 
fender, knocking over the poker and shovel with a crash. 
"hush!" said gandalf. "let thorin speak!" and this is bow thorin began. 
"gandalf, dwarves and mr. baggins! we are not together in the house of our friend and 
fellow conspirator, this most excellent and audacious hobbitmay the hair on his toes

conspirator, though no noise came out, he was so flummoxed. so thorin went on: 
"we are met to discuss our plans, our ways, means, policy and devices. we shall soon 
before the break of day start on our long journey, a journey from which some of us, or 
perhaps all of us (except our friend and counsellor, the ingenious wizard gandalf) may 
never return. it is a solemn moment. our object is, i take it, well known to us all. to the 
estimable mr. baggins, and perhaps to one or two of the younger dwarves (i think i 
should be right in naming kili and fili, for instance), the exact situation at the moment 
may require a little brief explanation-" 
this was thorin's style. he was an important dwarf. if he had been allowed, he would 
probably have gone on like this until he was out of breath, without telling any one there 
'anything that was not known already. but he was rudely interrupted. poor bilbo couldn't 
bear it any longer. at may never return he began to feel a shriek coming up inside, and

very soon it burst out like the whistle of an engine coming out of a tunnel. all the 
dwarves sprang bp knocking over the table. gandalf struck a blue light on the end of his 
magic staff, and in its firework glare the poor little hobbit could be seen kneeling on the 
hearth-rug, shaking like a jelly that was melting. then he fell flat on the floor, and kept on 
calling out "struck by lightning, struck by lightning!" over and over again; and that was all 
they could get out of him for a long time. so they took him and laid him out of the way on 
the drawingroom sofa with a drink at his

burglar, a burglar he is, or will be when the time comes. there is a lot more in him than 
you guess, and a deal more than he has any idea of himself. you may (possibly) all live 
to thank me yet. now bilbo, my boy, fetch the lamp, and let's have little light on this!" 
on the table in the light of a big lamp with a red shad he spread a piece 
of parchment rather like a map. 
"this was made by thror, your grandfather, thorin, he said in answer to the dwarves' 
excited questions. "it is a plan of the mountain." 
"i don't see that this will help us much," said thorin disappointedly after a glance. "i 
remember the mountain well enough and the lands about it. 
and i know where mirkwood is, and the withered heath where the great dragons bred." 
"there is a dragon marked in red on the mountain, said balin, "but it will be easy enough 
to find him without that, if ever we arrive there." 
"there is one point that you haven't noticed," said the wizard, "an

"it may have been secret once," said thorin, "but how do we know that it is secret any 
longer? old smaug had lived there long enough now to find out anything there is to 
know about those caves." 
"he may-but he can't have used it for years and years. "why?" 
"because it is too small. 'five feet high the door and three may walk abreast' say the 
runes, but smaug could not creep into a hole that size, not even when he was a young 
dragon, certainly not after devouring so many of the dwarves and men of dale." 
"it seems a great big hole to me," squeaked bilbo (who had no experience of dragons 
and only of hobbit-holes) he was getting excited and interested again, so that he forgot 
to keep his mouth shut. he loved maps, and in his hall there hung a large one of the 
country round with all his favourite walks marked on it in red ink. "how could such a 
large door be kept secret from everybody outside, apart from the dragon?" he asked. he 
was only a little hobbit you must remember.

"in lots of ways," said gandalf. "but in what way this one has been hidden we don't know 
without going to see. from what it says on the map i should guess there is a closed door 

which has been made to look exactly like the side of the mountain. that is the usual 
dwarves' method- i think that is right, isn't it?" "quite right," said thorin. 
"also," went on gandalf, "i forgot to mention that with the map went a key, a small and 
curious key. here it is!" he said, and handed to thorin a key with a long barrel and 
intricate wards, made of silver. "keep it safe!" 
"indeed i will," said thorin, and he fastened it upon a fine chain that hung about his neck 
and under his jacket. "now things begin to look more hopeful. this news alters them 
much for-the better. so

leisure to make beautiful things just for the fun of it, not to speak of the most marvellous 
and magical toys, the like of which is not to be found in the world now-a-days. so my 
grandfather's halls became full of armour and jewels and carvings and cups, and the toy-
market of dale was the wonder of the north. 
"undoubtedly that was what brought the dragon. dragons steal gold and jewels, you 
know, from men and elves and dwarves, wherever they can find them; and they guard 
their plunder as long as they live (which is practically forever, unless they are killed), and 
never enjoy a brass ring of it. indeed they hardly know a good bit of work from a bad, 
though they usually have a good notion of the current market value; and they can't make 
a thing for themselves, not even mend a little loose scale of their armour. there were 
lots of dragons in the north in those days, and gold was probably getting scarce up 
there,

with the dwarves flying south or getting killed, and all the general waste and 
destruction that dragons make going from bad to worse. there was a most specially 
greedy, strong and wicked worm called smaug. one day he flew up into the air and 
came south. the first we heard of it was a noise like a hurricane coming from the north, 
and the pine-trees on the mountain creaking and cracking in the wind. some of the 
dwarves who happened to be outside (i was one luckily -a fine adventurous lad in those 
days, always wandering about, and it saved my life that day)-well, from a good way off 
we saw the dragon settle on our mountain in a spout of flame. then he came down the 
slopes and when he reached the woods they all went up in fire. by that time all the bells 
were ringing in dale and the warriors were arming. the dwarves rushed out of their great 
gate; but there was the dragon waiting for them. none escaped tha

rushed up in steam and a fog fell on dale, and in the fog the dragon came on them and 
destroyed most of the warriors-the usual unhappy story, it was only too common in those 
days. then he went back and crept in through the front gate and routed out all the 
halls, and lanes, and tunnels, alleys, cellars, mansions and passages. after that there 
were no dwarves left alive inside, and he took all their wealth for himself. probably, for 
that is the dragons' way, he has piled it all up in a great heap far inside, and sleeps on it 
for a bed. later he used to crawl out of the great gate and come by night to dale, and 
carry away people, especially maidens, to eat, until dale was ruined, and all the people 
dead or gone. what goes on there now i don't know for certain, but i don't suppose 
anyone lives nearer to the mountain than the far edge of the long

"your grandfather," said the wizard slowly and grimly, "gave the map to his son for safety 
before he went to the mines of moria. your father went away to try his luck with the map 
after your grandfather was killed; and lots of adventures of a most unpleasant sort he 
had, but he never got near the mountain. how he got there i don't know, but i found him 
a prisoner in the dungeons of the necromancer." 
"whatever were you doing there?" asked thorin with a shudder, and all the dwarves 
shivered. 
"never you mind. i was finding things out, as usual; and a nasty dangerous business it 
was. even i, gandalf, only just escaped. i tried to save your father, but it was too late. 
he was witless and wandering, and had forgotten almost everything except the map and 
the key." "we have long ago paid the goblins of moria," said thorin; "we must give a 
thought to the necromancer." "don't be absurd! he is an enemy quite beyond the 
powers of all the dwarves put together, if they could a

been all day; his hood was dripping into his eyes, his cloak was full of water; the pony 
was tired and stumbled on stones; the others were too grumpy to talk. "and i'm sure the 
rain has got into the dry clothes and into the food-bags," thought bilbo. "bother burgling 
and everything to do with it! 
i wish i was at home in my nice hole by the fire, with the kettle just beginning to sing!" it

nd that they would have to camp where they were. so far they had 
not camped before on this journey, and though they knew that they soon would have to 
camp regularly, when they were among the misty mountains and far from the lands of 
respectable people, it seemed a bad wet evening to begin, on. they moved to a clump 
of trees, and though it was drier under them, the wind shook the rain off the leaves, and 
the drip, drip, was most annoying. 
also the mischief seemed to have got into the fire. dwarves can make a fire almost 
anywhere out of almost anything, wind or no wind; but they could not do it that night, not 
even oin and gloin, who were specially good at it. 
then one of the ponies took fright at nothing and bolted. he got into the river before they 
could catch him; and before they could get him out again, fili and kili were nearly 
drowned, and all the baggage that he carried was washed away off him. of course it was 
mostly food, and there was mighty little left for supper, and les

kicking and thumping, while tom whacked at then both with a branch to bring them to 
their senses-and that of course only made them madder than ever. that would have 
been the time for bilbo to have left. but his poor little feet had been very squashed in 
bert's big paw, and he had no breath in his body, and his head was going round; so 
there he lay for a while panting, just outside the circle of firelight. 
right in the middle of the fight up came balin. the dwarves had heard noises from a 
distance, and after wait-ing for some time for bilbo to come back, or to hoot like an owl, 
they started off one by one to creep towards the light as quietly as they could. no sooner 
did tom see balin come into the light than he gave an awful howl. trolls simply detest 
the very sight of dwarves (uncooked). bert and bill stopped fighting immediately, and "a 
sack, tom, quick!" they said, before balin, who was wondering where in all this 
commotion bilbo was, knew what

was happening, a sack was over his head, and he was 
down. 
"there's more to come yet," said tom, "or i'm mighty mistook. lots and none at all, it is," 
said he. "no burra- hobbits, but lots of these here dwarves. that's about the shape of it!" 
"i reckon you're right," said bert, "and we'd best get out of the light." 
and so they did. with sacks in their hands, that they used for carrying off mutton and 
other plunder, they waited in the shadows. as each dwarf came up and looked at the 
fire, and the spilled jugs, and the gnawed mutton, in surprise, pop! went a nasty smelly 
sack over his head, and he was down. soon dwalin lay by balin, and fili and kili 

together, and dori and nori and ori all in a

heap, and oin and gloin and bifur and bofur 
and bombur piled uncomfortably near the fire. 
"that'll teach 'em," said tom; for bifur and bombur had given a lot of trouble, and fought 
like mad, as dwarves will when cornered. 
thorin came last-and he was not caught unawares. he came expecting mischief, and 
didn't need to see his friends' legs sticking out of sacks to tell him that things were not all 
well. he stood outside in the shadows some way off, and said: "what's all this trouble? 
who has been knocking my people about?" 
"it's trolls!" said bilbo from behind a tree. they had forgotten all about him. "they're 
hiding in the bushes with sacks," said he. 
"o! are they?" said thorin, and he

ickle they were all in now: all neatly tied up in sacks, with three angry trolls (and 
two with burns and bashes to remember) sitting by them, arguing whether they should 
roast them slowly, or mince them fine and boil them, or just sit on them one by one and 
squash them into jelly: and bilbo up in a bush, with his clothes and his skin torn, not 
daring to move for fear they should hear him. 
it was just then that gandalf came back. but no one saw him. the trolls had just decided 
to roast the dwarves now and eat them later-that was bert's idea, and after a lot of 
argument they had all agreed to it. 
"no good roasting 'em now, it'd take all night," said a voice. bert thought it was william's. 
"don't start the argument all over-again. bill," he said, "or it will take all night." 
"who's a-arguing?" said william, who thought it was. bert that had spoken. 
"you are," said bert. 
"you're a liar," said william; and so the argument beg all over again. in the end they 
decided to mince them fine

now, must 
be underground before dawn, or they go back to the stuff of the mountains they are 
made of, and never move again. that is what had happened to bert and tom and 
william. 
"excellent!" said gandalf, as he stepped from behind a tree, and helped bilbo to climb 
down out of a thorn-bush. then bilbo understood. it was the wizard's voice that had kept 
the trolls bickering and quarrelling, until the light came and made an end of them. 
the next thing was to untie the sacks and let out the dwarves. they were nearly 
suffocated, and very annoyed: they had not at all enjoyed lying there listening to the 
trolls making plans for roasting them and squashing them and mincing them. they had 
to hear bilbo's account of what had happened to him twice over, before they were 
satisfied. 
"silly time to go practising pinching and pocket-picking," said bombur, "when what we 
wanted was fire and food!" 
"and that's just what you wouldn't have got of those fellows without a struggle, in any 
case," sa

so they laughed and sang in the trees; and pretty fair nonsense i daresay you think it. 
not that they would care they would only laugh all the more if you told them so. they 
were elves of course. soon bilbo caught glimpses of them as the darkness deepened. 
he loved elves, though he seldom met them; but he was a little frightened of them too. 
dwarves don't get on well with them. 
even decent enough dwarves like thorin and his friends think them foolish (which is a 
very foolish thing to think), or get annoyed with them. for some elves tease them and 
laugh at them, and most of all at their beards. 
"well, well!" said a voice. "just look! bilbo the hobbit on a pony, my dear! isn't it 
delicious!" 
"most astonishing wonderful!" 
then off they went into another song as ridiculous as the one i have written down in full.

also he would have liked to have a few private words with these people that seemed to 
know his name and all about him, although he had never been them before. he thought 
their opinion of his adventure might be interesting. elves know a lot and are wondrous 
folk for news, and know what is going on among the peoples of the land, as quick as 
water flows, or quicker. but the dwarves were all for supper as soon 'as possible just 
then, and would not stay. on they all went, leading their ponies, till they were brought to 
a good path and so at last to the very brink of the river. it was flowing fast and noisily, as 
mountain-streams do of a summer evening, when sun has been all day on the snow far 
up above. there was only a narrow bridge of stone without a parapet, as narrow as a 
pony could well walk on; and over that they had to go, slow and careful, one by one,

deserted caverns of the mines of moria, since the dwarf and goblin war." 
thorin pondered these words. "i will keep this sword in honour," he said. 
"may it soon cleave goblins once again!" 
"a wish that is likely to be granted soon enough in the mountains!" said elrond. "but 
show me now your map!" he took it and gazed long at it, and he shook his head; for if he 
did not altogether approve of dwarves and their love of gold, he hated dragons and their 
cruel wickedness, and he grieved to remember the ruin of the town of dale and its merry 
bells, and the burned banks of the bright river running. the moon was shining in a 
broad silver crescent. he held up the map and the white light shone through it. "what is

of excitement. he loved maps, as i have 
told you before; and he also liked runes and letters and cunning handwriting, though 
when he wrote himself it was a bit thin and spidery. 
"moon-letters are rune-letters, but you cannot see them," said elrond, "not when you 
look straight at them. they can only be seen when the moon shines behind them, and 
what is more, with the more cunning sort it must be a moon of the same shape and 
season as the day when they were written. the dwarves invented them and wrote them 
with silver pens, as your friends could tell you. these must have been written on a 
midsummer's eve in a crescent moon, a long while ago." 
"what do they say?" asked gandalf and thorin together, a bit vexed perhaps that even 
elrond should have found this out first, though really there had not been a chance 
before, and there would not have been another until goodness knows when. 
"stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks," read elrond, "and the setting sun

"durin, durin!" said thorin. "he was the father of the fathers of the eldest race of 
dwarves, the longbeards, and my first ancestor: i am his heir." 
"then what is durin's day?" asked elrond. 
"the first day of the dwarves' new year," said thorin, "is as all should know the first, day 
of the last moon of autumn on the threshold of winter. we still call it durin's day when 
the last moon of autumn and the sun are in the sky together. but this will not help us 
much, i fear, for it passes our skill in these days to guess when such a time will come 
again." 
"that remains to be seen," said gandalf. "is there any more writing?" 
"none to be seen by this moon," said elrond, and he gave the map back to

amid songs of farewell and good speed, with their hearts ready for more adventure, and 
with a knowledge of the road they must follow over the misty mountains to the land 
beyond. 
 
chapter 4 
over hill and under hill 
 
there were many paths that led up into those mountains, and many passes over them. 
but most of the paths were cheats and deceptions and led nowhere or to bad ends; and 
most of the passes were infested by evil things and dreadful dangers. the dwarves and 
the hobbit, helped by the wise advice of elrond and the knowledge and memory of 
gandalf, took the right road to the right pass. 
long days after they had climbed out of the valley and left the last homely house miles 
behind, they were still going up and up and up. it was a hard path and a dangerous path, 
a crooked way and a lonely and a long. now they could look back over the lands they 
had left, laid out behind them far below. far, far away in the west, where things were

other side at this rate." and the others were thinking equally gloomy thoughts, although 
when they had said good-bye to elrond in the high hope of a midsummer morning, they' 
had spoken gaily of the passage of the mountains, and of riding swift across the lands 
beyond. they had thought of coming to the secret door in the lonely mountain, perhaps 
that very next first moon of autumn-" and perhaps it will be durin's day" they had said. 
only gandalf had shaken his head and said nothing. dwarves had not passed that way 
for many years, but gandalf had, and he knew how evil and danger had grown and 
thriven in the wild, since the dragons had driven men from the lands, and the goblins 
had spread in secret after the battle of the mines of moria. even the good plans of wise 
wizards like gandalf and of good friends like elrond go astray sometimes when you are 
off on dangerous adventures over the edge of the wild; and gandalf was a wise enough 
wizard to know it. 
he knew that something u

 all over the mountainsides. 
"this won't do at all!" said thorin. "if we don't get blown off or drowned, or struck by 
lightning, we shall be picked up by some giant and kicked sky-high for a football." 
"well, if you know of anywhere better, take us there!" said gandalf, who was feeling very 
grumpy, and was far from happy about the giants himself. 
the end of their argument was that they sent fill and kili to look for a better shelter. 
they had very sharp eyes, and being the youngest of the dwarves by some fifty years 
they usually got these sort of jobs (when everybody could see that it was absolutely no 
use sending bilbo). there is nothing like looking, if you want to find something (or so 
thorin said to the young dwarves). you certainly usually find something, if you look, but 
it is not always quite the something you were after. so it proved on this occasion. 
soon fili and kili came crawling back, holding on to the rocks in the wind. "we have 
found a dry cave," they said, "not far

you could say rocks and blocks. there were six to each dwarf, at least, and two even for 
bilbo; and they were all grabbed and carried through the crack, before you could say 
tinder and flint. but not gandalf. 
bilbo's yell had done that much good. it had wakened him up wide in a splintered 
second, and when goblins came to grab him, there was a terrible flash like lightning in 
the cave, a smell like gunpowder, and several of them fell dead. 
the crack closed with a snap, and bilbo and the dwarves were on the wrong side of it! 
where was gandalf? of that neither they nor the goblins had any idea, and the goblins 
did not wait to find out. it was deep, deep, dark, such as only goblins that have taken to 
living in the heart of the mountains can see through. the passages there were crossed 
and tangled in all directions, but the goblins knew their way, as well as you do to the 
nearest post-office; and the way went down and down, and it was most horribly stuffy. 
the goblins were very roug

it sounded truly terrifying. the walls echoed to the clap, snap! and the crush, smash! and 
to the ugly laughter of their ho, ho! my lad! the general meaning of the song was only 
too plain; for now the goblins took out whips and whipped them with a swish, smack!, 
and set them running as fast as they could in front of them; and more than one of the 
dwarves were already yammering and bleating like anything, when they stumbled into a 
big cavern. 
it was lit by a great red fire in the middle, and by torches along the walls, and it was full 
of goblins. they all laughed and stamped and clapped their hands, when the dwarves 
(with poor little bilbo at the back and nearest to the whips) came running in, while the 
goblin-drivers whooped and cracked their whips behind. the ponies were already there 
huddled in a corner; and there were all the baggages

backs and linked them all together in a line and dragged them to the far end of the 
cavern with little bilbo tugging at the end of the row. 
there in the shadows on a large flat stone sat a tremendous goblin with a huge head, 
and armed goblins were standing round him carrying the axes and the bent swords that 
they use. now goblins are cruel, wicked, and bad-hearted. 
they make no beautiful things, but they make many clever ones. they can tunnel and 
mine as well as any but the most skilled dwarves, when they take the trouble, though 
they are usually untidy and dirty. hammers, axes, swords, daggers, pickaxes, tongs, and 
also instruments of torture, they make very well, or get other people to make to their 
design, prisoners and slaves that have to work till they die for want of air and light. it is 
not unlikely that they invented some of the machines that have since troubled the world, 
especially the ingenious devices for killing large numbers of people at once, for wheels

s and explosions always delighted them, and also not working with their own 
hands more than they could help; but in those days and those wild parts they had not 
advanced (as it is called) so far. they did not hate dwarves especially, no more than 
they hated everybody and everything, and particularly the orderly and prosperous; in 
some parts wicked dwarves had even made alliances with them. but they had a special 
grudge against thorin's people, because of the war which you have heard mentioned, 
but which does not come into this tale; and anyway goblins don't care who they catch, as 
long as it is done smart and secret, and the prisoners are not able to defend 
themselves. 
"who are these miserable persons?" said the great goblin. 
"dwarves, and this!" said one of the drivers, pulling at bilbo's chain so that he fell 
forward onto his knees.

on they went. gandalf was quite right: they began to hear goblin noises and horrible 
cries far behind in the passages they had come through. that sent them on faster than 
ever, and as poor bilbo could not possibly go half as fast-for dwarves can roll along at a 
tremendous pace, i can tell you, when they have to-they took it in turn to carry him on 
their backs. 
still goblins go faster than dwarves, and these goblins knew the way better (they had 
made the paths themselves), and were madly angry; so that do what they could the 
dwarves heard the cries and howls getting closer and closer. soon they could hear even 
the flap of the goblin feet, many many feet which seemed only just round the last corner.

ound goblin-cleaver and foehammer shining cold and 
bright right in their astonished eyes. the ones in front dropped their torches and gave 
one yell before they were killed. the ones behind yelled still more, and leaped back 
knocking over those that were running after them. "biter and beater!" they shrieked; and 
soon they were all in confusion, and most of them were hustling back the way they had 
come. 
it was quite a long while before any of them dared to turn that comer. by that time the 
dwarves had gone on again, a long, long, way on into the dark tunnels of the goblins' 
realm. when the goblins discovered that, they put out their torches and they slipped on 
soft shoes, and they chose out their very quickest runners with the sharpest ears and 
eyes. these ran forward, as swift as weasels in the dark, and with hardly any more noise 
than bats. 
that is why neither bilbo, nor the dwarves, nor even gandalf heard them coming. nor 
did they see them. but they were seen by the goblins that

bumped his head on hard rock, and remembered nothing more.

shut. no one was anywhere near him. just imagine his fright!

very slowly he got up and groped about on all fours, till he touched the wall of the tunnel; 
but neither up nor down it could he find anything: nothing at all, no sign of goblins, no 
sign of dwarves. his head was swimming, and he was far from certain even of the 
direction they had been going in when he had his fall. he guessed as well as he could, 
and crawled along for a good way, till suddenly his hand met what felt like a tiny ring of 
cold metal lying on the floor of the tunnel. it was a turning point in his career, but he did 
not know it. he put the ring in his pocket almost without thinking; certainly it did not seem 
of any particular use at the moment. he did not go much further,

out of his skin when the hiss came in his ears, and he 
suddenly saw the pale eyes sticking out at him. 
"who are you?" he said, thrusting his dagger in front of him. 
"what iss he, my preciouss?" whispered gollum (who always spoke to himself through 
never having anyone else to speak to). this is what he had come to find out, for he was 
not really very hungry at the moment, only curious; otherwise he would have grabbed 
first and whispered afterwards. 
"i am mr. bilbo baggins. i have lost the dwarves and i have lost the wizard, and i don't 
know where i am; and "i don't want to know, if only i can get ,away." 
"what's he got in his handses?" said gollum, looking at the sword, which he did not quite 
like. 
"a sword, a blade which came out of gondolin!" 
"sssss," said gollum, and became quite polite. "praps ye sits here and chats with it a 
bitsy, my preciousss. it like riddles, praps it does, does it?" he was anxious to appear 
friendly, at any rate for the moment, and until he found out mo

is buttons and his friends. he wandered on and on, till the sun began 
to sink westwards-behind the mountains. their shadows fell across bilbo's path, and he 
looked back. then he looked forward and could see before him only ridges and slopes 
falling towards lowlands and plains glimpsed occasionally between the trees. 

"good heavens!" he exclaimed. "i seem to have got right to the other side of the misty 
mountains, right to the edge of the land beyond! where and o where can gandalf and 
the dwarves have got to? i only hope to goodness they are not still back there in the 
power of the goblins!" 
he still wandered on, out of the little high valley, over its edge, and down the slopes 
beyond; but all the while a very uncomfortable thought was growing inside him. he 
wondered whether he ought not, now he had the magic ring, to go back into the horrible, 
horrible, tunnels and look for his friends. he had just made up his mind that it was his 
duty, that he must turn back-and very miserable h

ere talking. 
he crept still nearer, and suddenly he saw peering between two big boulders a head with 
a red hood on: it was balin doing look-out. he could have clapped and shouted for joy, 
but he did not. he had still got the ring on, for fear of meeting something unexpected and 
unpleasant, and he saw that balin was looking straight at him without noticing him. 
"i will give them all a surprise," he thought, as he crawled into the bushes at the edge of 
the dell. gandalf was arguing with the dwarves. they were discussing all that had 
happened to them in the tunnels, and wondering and debating what they were to do 
now. the dwarves were grumbling, and gandalf was saying that they could not possibly 
go on with their journey leaving mr. baggins in the hands of the goblins, without trying to 
find out if he was alive or dead, and without trying to rescue him. 
"after all he is my friend," said the wizard, "and not a bad little chap. 
i feel responsible for him. i wish to goodness you had not

 lost him." 
the dwarves wanted to know why he had ever been brought at all, why he could not 
stick to his friends and come along with them, and why the wizard had not chosen 
someone with more sense. "he has been more trouble than use so far," said one. "if we 
have got to' go back now into those abominable tunnels to look for him, then drat him, i 
say." 
gandalf answered angrily: "i brought him, and i don't bring things that are of no use. 
either you help me to look for him, or i go and leave you here to get out o

rglar, confusticate him!" 
"and here's the burglar!" said bilbo stepping down into the middle of them, and slipping 
off the ring. 
bless me, how they jumped! then they shouted with surprise and delight. 
gandalf was as astonished as any of them, but probably more pleased than all the 
others. he called to balin and told him what he thought of a look-out man who let people 

walk right into them like that without warning. it is a fact that bilbo's reputation went up a 
very great deal with the dwarves after this. 
if they had still doubted that he was really a first-class burglar, in spite of gandalf's 
words, they doubted no longer. balin was the most puzzled of all; but everyone said it 
was a very clever bit of work. 
indeed bilbo was so pleased with their praise that he just chuckled inside and said 
nothing whatever about the ring; and when they asked him how he did it, he said: "o, 
just crept along, you know-very carefully and quietly." 
"well, it is the first time that even a mouse h

eard him talking to himself. he thought i really knew the 
way out, and so he was making for it. and then he sat down in the entrance, and i could 
not get by. so i jumped over him and escaped, and ran down to the gate." 
"what about guards?" they asked. "weren't there any?" 
"o yes! lots of them; but i dodged 'em. i got stuck in the door, which was only open a 
crack, and i lost lots of buttons," he said sadly looking at his torn clothes. "but i 
squeezed through all right-and here i am." 
the dwarves looked at him with quite a new respect, when he talked about dodging 
guards, jumping over gollum, and squeezing through, as if it was not very difficult or 
very alarming. 
"what did i tell you?" said gandalf laughing. "mr. baggins has more about him than you 
guess." he gave bilbo a queer look from under his bushy eyebrows, as he said this, and 
the hobbit wondered if he guessed at the part of his tale that he had left out. 
then he had questions of his own to ask, for if gandalf had explaine

dwarves, bilbo had not heard it. he wanted to know how the wizard had turned up again, 
and where they had all got to now. 
the wizard, to tell the truth, never minded explaining his cleverness more than once, so 
now he had told bilbo that both he and elrond had been well aware of the presence of 
evil goblins in that part of the mountains. but their main gate used to come out on a 
different pass, one more easy to travel by, so that they often caught people benighted 
near their gates. evidently peop

le had given up going that way, and the goblins must 
have opened their new entrance at the top of the pass the dwarves had taken, quite 
recently, because it had been found quite safe up to now. 
"i must see if i can't find a more or less decent giant to block it up again," said gandalf, 
"or soon there will be no getting over the mountains at all." 
as soon as gandalf had heard bilbo's yell he realized what had happened. 
in the flash which killed the goblins that were grabbing him he had nipped inside the 
crack, just as it snapped to. he followed after the drivers and prisoners right to the edge 
of the grea

nd a tree to shelter from the onslaught of 
the rocks. soon the danger was over, the slide had stopped, and the last faint crashes 
could be heard as the largest of the disturbed stones went bounding and spinning 
among the bracken and the pine-roots far below. 
"well! that has got us on a bit," said gandalf; "and even goblins tracking us will have a 
job to come down here quietly." 
"i daresay," grumbled bombur; "but they won't find it difficult to send stones bouncing 
down on our heads." the dwarves (and bilbo) were feeling far from happy, and were 
rubbing their bruised and damaged legs and feet. 
"nonsense! we are going to turn aside here out of the path of the slide. 
we must be quick! look at the light!" the sun had long gone behind the mountains. 
already the shadows were deepening about them, though far away through the trees 
and over the black tops of those growing lower down they could still see the evening 
lights on the plains beyond. they limped along now as fast as they were a

pushing through a sea of bracken with tall fronds rising right above the 
hobbit's head; at times they were marching along quiet as quiet over a floor of pine-
needles; and all the while the forest-gloom got heavier and the forest-silence deeper. 
there was no wind that evening to bring even a sea-sighing into the branches of the 
trees. 
"must we go any further?" asked bilbo, when it was so dark that he could only just see 
thorin's beard wagging beside him, and so quiet that he could hear the dwarves' 
breathing like a loud noise. "my toes are all bruised and bent, and my legs ache, and my 
stomach is wagging like an empty sack." 
"a bit further," said gandalf. 
after what seemed ages further they came suddenly to an opening where no trees grew. 
the moon was up and was shining into the clearing. somehow it struck all of them as 
not at all a nice place, although there was nothing wrong to see. 
all of a sudden they heard a howl away down hill, a long shuddering howl. 
it was answered by an

d, and it became a proverb, though we now say 'out of the frying-pan into 
the fire' in the same sort of uncomfortable situations. 
"up the trees quick!" cried gandalf; and they ran to the trees at the edge of the glade, 
hunting for those that had branches fairly low, or were slender enough to swarm up. 
they found them as quick as ever they could, you can guess; and up they went as high 
as ever they could trust the branches. you would have laughed (from a safe distance), if 
you had seen the dwarves sitting up in the trees with their beards dangling down, like old 
gentlemen gone cracked and playing at being boys. fili and kili were at the top of a tall 

larch like an enormous christmas tree. dori, nori, on, oin, and gloin were more 
comfortable in a huge pine with regular branches sticking out at intervals like the spokes 
of a wheel. bifur, bofur, bombur, and thorin were in another. dwalin and balin had

appened for a 
long while). but in those days they sometimes used to go on raids, especially to get food 
or slaves to work for them. then they often got the wargs to help and shared the 
plunder with them. sometimes they rode on wolves like men do on horses. now it 
seemed that a great goblin-raid had been planned for that very night. the wargs had 
come to meet the goblins and the goblins were late. the reason, no doubt, was the 
death of the great goblin, and all the excitement caused by the dwarves and bilbo and 
the wizard, for whom they were probably still hunting. 

in spite of the dangers of this far land bold men had of late been making their way back 
into it from the south, cutting down trees, and building themselves places to live in 
among the more pleasant woods in the valleys and along the river-shores. there were 
many of them, and they were brave and wellarmed, and even the wargs dared not 
attack them if there were many together, or in the bright day. but now they had plann

one on the back, and immediately his shaggy coat caught fire, and he was leaping to 
and fro yelping horribly. then another came and another, one in blue flames, one in red, 
another in green. they burst on the ground in the middle of the circle and went off in 
coloured sparks and smoke. 
a specially large one hit the chief wolf on the nose, and he leaped in the air ten feet, and 
then rushed round and round the circle biting and snapping even at the other wolves in 
his anger and fright. 
the dwarves and bilbo shouted and cheered. the rage of the wolves was terrible to see, 
and the commotion they made filled all the forest. wolves are afraid of fire at all times, 
but this was a most horrible and uncanny fire. if a spark got in their coats it stuck and 
burned into them, and unless they rolled over quick they were soon all in flames. very 
soon all about the glade wolves were rolling over and over to put out the sparks on their 
backs, while those that were burning were running about howli

the wolves that 
had caught fire and fled into the forest had set it alight in several places. it was high 
summer, and on this eastern side of the mountains there had been little rain for some 
time. yellowing bracken, fallen branches, deep-piled pine-needles, and here and there 
dead trees, were soon in flames. 
all round the clearing of the wargs fire was leaping. but the wolf-guards did not leave 
the trees. maddened and angry they were leaping and howling round the trunks, and 
cursing the dwarves in their horrible language, with their tongues hanging out, and their 
eyes shining as red and fierce as the flames. 
then suddenly goblins came running up yelling. they thought a battle with the woodmen 
was going on; but they goon learned what had really happened. some of them actually 
sat down and laughed. others waved their spears and clashed the shafts against their 
shields. goblins are not afraid of fire, and they soon had a plan which seemed to them 
most amusing.

ves together in a pack. some stacked fern and brushwood round 
the tree-trunks. others rushed round and stamped and beat, and beat and stamped, 
until nearly all the flames were put out-but they did not put out the fire nearest to the 
trees where the dwarves were. that fire they fed with leaves and dead branches and 
bracken. soon they had a ring of smoke and flame all round the dwarves, a ring which 
they kept from spreading outwards; but it closed slowly in, till the running fire was licking 
the fuel piled under the trees. smoke was in bilbo's eyes, he could feel the heat of the 
flames; and through the reek he could see the goblins dancing round and round in a 
circle like people round a midsummer bonfire. outside the ring of dancing warriors with 
spears and axes stood the wolves at a respectful distance, watching and waiting. 
he could hear the goblins beginning a horrib

to show them he was not frightened of them-though of course he was, wizard though he 
was. but they took no notice, and they went on singing.

and with that ya hoy! the flames were under gandalf's tree. in a moment it spread to the 
others. the bark caught fire, the lower branches cracked. 
then gandalf climbed to the top of his tree. the sudden splendour flashed from his 
wand like lightning, as he got ready to spring down from on high right among the spears 
of the goblins. that would have been the end of him, though he would probably have

 loud cried the lord of the 
eagles, to whom gandalf had now spoken. back swept the great birds that were with 
him, and down they came like huge black shadows. the wolves yammered and gnashed 
their teeth; the goblins yelled and stamped with rage, and flung their heavy spears in the 
air in vain. over them swooped the eagles; the dark rush of their beating wings smote 
them to the floor or drove them far away; their talons tore at goblin faces. other birds 
flew to the tree-tops and seized the dwarves, who were scrambling up now as far as 
ever they dared to go. 
poor little bilbo was very nearly left behind again! he just managed to catch hold of 
dori's legs, as dori was borne off last of all; and they went together above the tumult and 
the burning, bilbo swinging in the air with his arms nearly breaking. 
now far below the goblins and the wolves were scattering far and wide in the woods. a

 and even to be on friendly terms. as a matter of 
fact gandalf, who had often been in the mountains, had once rendered a service to the 
eagles and healed their lord from an arrow-wound. so you see 'prisoners' had meant 
'prisoners rescued from the goblins' only, and not captives of the eagles. as bilbo 
listened to the talk of gandalf he realized that at last they were going to escape really 
and truly from the dreadful mountains. he was discussing plans with the great 
eagle for carrying the dwarves and himself and bilbo far away and setting them 
down well on their journey across the plains below. 
the lord of the eagles would not take them anywhere near where men lived. 
"they would shoot at us with their great bows of yew," he said, "for they would think we 
were after their sheep. and at other times they would be right. 
no! we are glad to cheat the goblins of their sport, and glad to repay our thanks to you, 
but we will not risk ourselves for dwarves in the southward plains."

well," said gandalf. "take us where and as far as you will! we are already deeply 
obliged to you. but in the meantime we are famished with hunger." 
"i am nearly dead of it," said bilbo in a weak little voice that nobody heard. 

"that can perhaps be mended," said the lord of the eagles. 
later on you might have seen a bright fire on the shelf of rock and the figures of the 
dwarves round it cooking and making a fine roasting smell. the eagles had brought up 
dry boughs for fuel, and they had brought rabbits, hares, and a small sheep. the 
dwarves managed all the preparations. bilbo was too weak to help, and anyway he was 
not much good at skinning rabbits or cutting up meat, being used to having it delivered 
by the butcher all ready to cook. gandalf, too, was lying down after doing his part in 
setting the fire going, since oin and gloin had lost their tinder-boxes. (dwa

ng bilbo woke up with the early sun in his eyes. he jumped up to look at 
the time and to go and put his kettle on-and found he was not home at all. so he sat 
down and wished in vain for a wash and a brush. he did not get either, nor tea nor toast 
nor bacon for his breakfast, only cold mutton and rabbit. and after that he had to get 
ready for a fresh start. 
this time he was allowed to climb on to an eagle's back and cling between his wings. 
the air rushed over him and he shut his eyes. the dwarves were crying farewells and 
promising to repay the lord of the eagles if ever they could, as off rose fifteen great birds 
from the mountain's side. the sun was still close to the eastern edge of things. the 
morning was cool, and mists were in the valleys and hollows and twined here and there 
about the peaks and pinnacles of the hills. bilbo opened an eye to peep and saw that the 
birds were already high up and the world was far away, and the mountains were falling 
back behind them into the d

passengers. 
"farewell!" they cried, "wherever you fare, till your eyries receive you at the journey's 
end!" that is the polite thing to say among eagles. 
"may the wind under your wings bear you where the sun sails and the moon walks," 
answered gandalf, who knew the correct reply. 

and so they parted. and though the lord of the eagles became in after days the king of 
all birds and wore a golden crown, and his fifteen chieftains golden collars (made of the 
gold that the dwarves gave them), bilbo never saw them again - except high and far off 
in the battle of five armies. but as that comes in at the end of this tale we will say no 
more about it just now. 
there was a flat space on the top of the hill of stone and a well worn path with many 
steps leading down it to the river, across which a ford of huge flat stones led to the 
grass-land beyond the stream. there was a little cave (a wholesome one with a pebbly 
floor) at the foot of the steps and near the end of the

stony ford. here the party gathered 
and discussed what was to be done. 
"i always meant to see you all safe (if possible) over the mountains," said the wizard, 
"and now by good management and good luck i have done it. 
indeed we are now a good deal further east than i ever meant to come with you, for after 
all this is not my adventure. i may look in on it again before it is all over, but in the 
meanwhile i have some other pressing business to attend to." 
the dwarves groaned and looked most distressed, and bilbo wept. they had begun to 
think gandalf was going in come all the way and would always be there to help them out 
of difficulties. "i am not going to disappear this very instant," said he. "i can give you a 
day or two more. probably i can help you out of your present plight, and i need a little 
help myself. we have no food, and no baggage, and no ponies to ride; and you don't 
know where you are. now i can tell you that. you are still some miles no

knows it well." 
"who calls it? who knows it?" 
"the somebody i spoke of-a very great person. you must all be very polite when i 
introduce you. i shall introduce you slowly, two by two, i think; and you must be careful 
not to annoy him, or heaven knows what will happen. he can be appalling when he is 
angry, though he is kind enough if humoured. still i warn you he gets angry easily." 
the dwarves all gathered round when they heard the wizard talking like this to bilbo. "is 
that the person you are taking us to now?" they asked. 
"couldn't you find someone more easy-tempered? hadn't you better explain it all a bit 
clearer?"-and so on. 

"yes it certainly is! no i could not! and i was explaining very carefully," answered the 
wizard crossly. "if you must know more, his name is 
beorn. he is very strong, and he is a skin-changer." 
"what! a furrier, a man that calls rabbits conies, when

he does not eat them; neither does he hunt or eat wild animals. he keeps hives and 
hives of great fierce bees, and lives most on cream and honey. as a bear he ranges far 
and wide. i once saw him sitting all alone on the top of the carrock at night watching the 
moon sinking towards the misty mountains, and i heard him growl in the tongue of bears; 
'the day will come when they will perish and i shall go back!' that is why i believe he 
once came from the mountains himself." 
bilbo and the dwarves had now plenty to think about, and they asked no more questions. 
they still had a long way to walk before them. up slope and down dale they plodded. it 
grew very hot. sometimes they rested under the trees, and then bilbo felt so hungry that 
he would have eaten acorns, if any had been ripe enough yet to have fallen to the 
ground. 
it was the middle of the afternoon before they noticed that great patches of flowers had 
begun to spring up, all the same kinds growing together as if they had be

they were bigger than hornets. the drones were bigger than your thumb, a good deal, 
and the bands of yellow on their deep black bodies shone like fiery gold. 
"we are getting near," said gandalf. "we are on the edge of his beepastures." 
after a while they came to a belt of tall and very ancient oaks, and beyond these to a 
high thorn-hedge through which you could neither see nor scramble. 
"you had better wait here," said the wizard to the dwarves; "and when i call or whistle 
begin to come after me - you will see the way i go-but only in pairs, mind, about five 
minutes between each pair of you. bombur is fattest and will do for two, he had better 
come alone and last. come on mr. baggins! 
there is a gate somewhere round this way." and with that he went off along the hedge 
taking the frightened hobbit with him. 
they soon came to a wooden gate, high and broad, beyond which they could see 
gardens and a cluster of low wooden buildings,

"or two? i can only see one, and a little one at that," said beorn. 
"well to tell you the truth, i did not like to bother you with a lot of us, until i found out if 
you were busy. i will give a call, if i may." 
"go on, call away!" 
so gandalf gave a long shrill whistle, and presently thorin and dori came round the 
house by the garden path and stood bowing low before them. 
"one or three you meant, i see!" said beorn. "but these aren't hobbits, they are 
dwarves!" 
"thorin oakenshield, at your service! dori at your service!" said the two 
dwarves bowing again. 
"i don't need your service, thank you," said beorn, "but i expect you need mine. i am not 
over fond of dwarves; but if it is true you are thorin (son of thrain, son of thror, i 
believe), and that your companion is respectable, and that you are enemies of goblins 
and are not up to any mischief in my lands-what are you up to, by the way?" 
"they are on their way to visit the land of their fathe

"hullo!" said beorn. "you came pretty quick-where were you hiding? come on my jack-
in-the-boxes!" 
"nori at your service, ori at . . ." they began; but beorn interrupted them. 
"thank you! when i want your help i will ask for it. sit down, and let's get on with this 
tale, or it will be supper-time before it is ended." 
"as soon as we were asleep," went on gandalf, "a crack at the back of the cave opened; 
goblins came out and grabbed the hobbit and the dwarves and our troop of ponies-" 
"troop of ponies? what were you-a travelling circus? or were you carrying lots of 
goods? or do you always call six a troop?" 
"o no! as a matter of fact there were more than six ponies, for there were more than six 
of us-and well, here are two more!" just at that moment balin and dwalin appeared and 
bowed so low that their beards swept the stone floor. the big man was frowning at first, 
but they did their very best to be frightfully polite, and kept on nodding and

us left!" 
"fourteen! that's the first time i've heard one from ten leave fourteen. 
you mean nine, or else you haven't told me yet all the names of your party." 
"well, of course you haven't seen oin and gloin yet. and, bless me! here they are. i 
hope you will forgive them for bothering you." 
"o let 'em all come! hurry up! come along, you two, and sit down! but look here, 
gandalf, even now we have only got yourself and ten dwarves and the hobbit that was 
lost. that only makes eleven (plus one mislaid) and not fourteen, unless wizards count 
differently to other people. but now please get on with the tale." beorn did not show it 
more than he could help, but really he had begun to get very interested. you see, in the 
old days he had known the very part of the mountains that gandalf was describing. he 
nodded and he growled, when he heard of the hobbit's reappearance and of their 
scramble down the stone-slide and of the

behind. he was fat, and 
also angry at being left till last. he refused to wait five minutes, and followed immediately 
after the other two. 
"well, now there are fifteen of you; and since goblins can count, i suppose that is all that 
there were up the trees. now perhaps we can finish this story without any more 
interruptions." mr. baggins saw then how clever gandalf had been. the interruptions 

had really made beorn more interested in the story, and the story had kept him from 
sending the dwarves off at once like suspicious beggars. he never invited people into his 
house, if he could help it. he had very few friends and they lived a good way away; and 
he never invited more than a couple of these to his house at a time. now he had got 
fifteen strangers sitting in his porch! 
by the time the wizard had finished his tale and had told of the eagles' rescue and of 
how they had all been brought to the carrock, the sun had fallen behind the peaks of the 
misty mountains and the shadows wer

 since they left the last 
homely house in the west and said good-bye to elrond. the light of the torches and the 
fire flickered about them, and on the table were two tall red beeswax candles. all the 
time they ate, beorn in his deep rolling voice told tales of the wild lands on this side of 
the mountains, and especially of the dark and dangerous wood, that lay outstretched far 
to north and south a day's ride before them, barring their way to the east, the terrible 
forest of mirkwood. 
the dwarves listened and shook their beards, for they knew that they must soon venture 
into that forest and that after the mountains it was the worst of the perils they had to 
pass before they came to the dragon's stronghold. when dinner was over they began to 
tell tales of their own, but beorn seemed to be growing drowsy and paid little heed to 
them. they spoke most of gold and silver and jewels and the making of things by smith-
craft, and beorn did not appear to care for such things: there were no t

 and 
the torches were put out, and still they sat in the light of the dancing flames with the 
pillars of the house standing tall behind them, arid dark at the top like trees of the forest. 

whether it was magic or not, it seemed to bilbo that he heard a sound like wind in the 
branches stirring in the rafters, and the hoot of owls. soon he began to nod with sleep 
and the voices seemed to grow far away, until he woke with a start. 
the great door had creaked and slammed. beorn was gone. the dwarves were sitting 
cross-legged on the floor round the fire, and presently they began to sing. some of the 
verses were like this, but there were many more, and their singing went on for a long 
while: 
 
"the wind was on the withered heath, 
but in the forest stirred no leaf: 
there shadows lay by night and day, 
and dark things silent crept beneath. 
the wind came down from mountains cold, 
and like a tide it roared and rolled; 
the branches groaned, the forest moaned, 
and leaves were laid upon t

u all not to forget what beorn said before he left us: you must not stray outside until 
the sun is up, on your peril." 
bilbo found that beds had already been laid at the side of the hall, on a sort of raised 
platform between the pillars and the outer wall. for him there was a little mattress of 
straw and woollen blankets. he snuggled into them very gladly, summertime though it 
was. the fire burned low and he fell asleep. 
yet in the night he woke: the fire had now sunk to a few embers; the dwarves and 
gandalf were all asleep, to judge by their breathing; a splash of white on the floor came 
from the high moon, which was peering down through the smokehole in the roof. 
there was a growling sound outside, and a noise as of some great animal scuffling at 
the door. bilbo .wondered what it was, and whether it could be beorn in enchanted 
shape, and if he would come in as a bear and kill them. 
he dived under the blankets and hid his head, and fell asleep again at last in spite of his 
fears

it was full morning when he awoke. one of the dwarves had fallen over him in the 
shadows where he lay, and had rolled down with a bump from the platform on to the 
floor. it was bofur, and he was grumbling about it, when bilbo opened his eyes. 
"get up lazybones," he said, "or there will be no breakfast left for you." 
up jumped bilbo. "breakfast!" he cried. "where is breakfast?" 
"mostly inside us," answered the other dwarves who were moving around the hall; "but 
what is left is out on the veranda. we have been about looking for beorn ever since the 
sun got up; but there is no sign of him anywhere, though we found breakfast laid as soon 
as we went out." 
"where is gandalf?" asked bilbo, moving off to find something to eat as quick as he 
could. 
"o! out and about somewhere," they told him. but he saw no sign of the wizard all that 
day until the evening. just before sunset he walked into the hall, where the hobbi

the dwarves were having supper, waited on by beorn's wonderful animals, as they had 
been all day. of beorn they had seen and heard nothing since the night before, and they 
were getting puzzled. 
"where is our host, and where have you been all day yourself?" they all cried. 
"one question at a time-and none till after supper! i haven't had a bite since breakfast." 
at last gandalf pushed away his plate and jug - he had eaten two whole loaves (with 
masses of butter and honey and clotted cream) and drunk a

long while silent. 
bilbo thought he knew what the wizard meant. "what shall we do," he cried, "if he leads 
all the wargs and the goblins down here? we shall all be caught and killed! i thought 
you said he was not 9 friend of theirs." 

"so i did. and don't be silly! you had better go to bed, your wits are sleepy." 
the hobbit felt quite crushed, and as there seemed nothing else to do he did go to bed; 
and while the dwarves were still singing songs he dropped asleep, still puzzling his little 
head about beorn, till he dreamed a dream of hundreds of black bears dancing slow 
heavy dances round and round in the moonlight in the courtyard. then he woke up when 
everyone else was asleep, and he heard the same scraping, scuffling, snuffling, and 
growling as before. next morning they were all wakened by beorn himself. 
"so here you all are still!" he said. he picked up the hobbit and laughed: "not eaten up

 wonder long where he had been or why he was so nice to 
them, for he told them himself. he had been over the river and right back up into the 
mountains-from which you can guess that he could travel quickly, in bear's shape at any 
rate. from the burnt wolfglade he had soon found out that part of their story was true; 
but he had found more than that: he had caught a warg and a goblin wandering in the 
woods. from these he had got news: the goblin patrols were still hunting with 
wargs for the dwarves, and they were fiercely angry because of the death of the great 
goblin, and also because of the burning of the chief wolf's nose and the death from the 
wizard's fire of many of his chief servants. so much they told him when he forced them, 
but he guessed there was more wickedness than this afoot, and that a great raid of the 
whole goblin army with their wolfallies into the lands shadowed by the mountains might 
soon be made to find the dwarves, or to take vengeance on the men and creatures

"it was a good story, that of yours," said beorn, "but i like it still better now i am sure it is 
true. you must forgive my not taking your word. if you lived near the edge of mirkwood, 
you would take the word of no one that you did not know as well as your brother or 
better. as it is, i can only say that i have hurried home as fast as i could to see that you 
were safe, and to offer you any help that i can. i shall think more kindly of dwarves after 
this. killed the great goblin, killed the great goblin!" he chuckled fiercely to himself. 
"what did you do with the goblin and the warg?" asked bilbo suddenly. 
"come and see!" said beorn, and they followed round the house. a goblin's head was 
stuck outside the gate and a warg-skin was nailed to a tree just beyond. beorn was a 
fierce enemy. but now he was their friend, and gandalf thought it wise to tell him their 
whole story and the reason of their journey, so that they could get th

its were to be seen. by the afternoon they had 
reached the eaves of mirkwood, and were resting almost beneath the great overhanging 
boughs of its outer trees. their trunks were huge and gnarled, their branches twisted, 
their leaves were dark and long. ivy grew on them and trailed along the ground. 
"well, here is mirkwood!" said gandalf. "the greatest of the forests of the northern 
world. i hope you like the look of it. now you must send back these excellent ponies you 
have borrowed." 
the dwarves were inclined to grumble at this, but the wizard told them they were fools. 
"beorn is not as far off as you seem to think, and you had better keep your promises 
anyway, for he is a bad enemy. mr. baggins' eyes are sharper than yours, if you have 
not seen each night after dark a great bear going along with us or sitting far of in the

"what about the horse, then?" said thorin. "you don't mention sending that back." 
"i don't, because i am not sending it." 
"what about your promise then?" 
"i will look after that. i am not sending the horse back, i am riding it!" 
then they knew that gandalf was going to leave them at the very edge of 
mirkwood, and they were in despair. 
but nothing they could say would change his mind.

"do we really have to go through?" groaned the hobbit. 
"yes, you do!" said the wizard, "if you want to get to the other side. 
you must either go through or give up your quest. and i am not going to allow you to 
back out now, mr. baggins. i am ashamed of you for thinking of it. you have got to look 
after all these dwarves for me," he laughed. 
"no! no!" said bilbo. "i didn't mean that. i meant, is there no way round?" 
"there is, if you care to go two hundred miles or so out of your way north, and twice that 
south. but you wouldn't get a safe path even then. there are no safe paths in this part of 
the world. remember you are over the edge of the wild now, and in for all sorts of fun 
wherever you go. before you could get round mirkwood in the north you would be right

"good-bye then, and really good-bye!" said gandalf, and he turned his horse and rode 
down into the west. but he could not resist the temptation to have the last word. before 
he had passed quite out of hearing he turned and put his hands to his mouth and called 
to them. they heard his voice come faintly: "good-bye! be good, take care of 
yourselves-and don't leave the path!" 
then he galloped away and was soon lost to sight. "o good-bye and go away!" grunted 
the dwarves, all the more angry because they were really filled with dismay at losing 
him. now began the most dangerous part of all the journey. 
they each shouldered the heavy pack and the water-skin which was their share, and 
turned from the light that lay on the lands outside and plunged into the forest.

other reason they could not guess. 
it was not long before they grew to hate the forest as heartily as they had hated the 
tunnels of the goblins, and it seemed to offer even less hope of any ending. but they had 
to go on and on, long after they were sick for a sight of the sun and of the sky, and 
longed for the feel of wind on their faces. there was no movement of air down under the 
forest-roof, and it was everlastingly still and dark and stuffy. even the dwarves felt it, who 
were used to tunnelling, and lived at times for long whiles without the light of the sun; but 
the hobbit, who liked holes to make a house in but not to spend summer days in, felt he 
was being slowly suffocated. 
the nights were the worst. it then became pitch-dark - not what you call pitch-dark, but 
really pitch; so black that you really could see nothing.

side he can hook it on, and you can draw the boat back." 
in this way they were all soon on the far bank safe across the enchanted stream. dwalin 
had just scrambled out with the coiled rope on his arm, and bombur (still grumbling) was 
getting ready to follow, when something bad did happen. there was a flying sound of 
hooves on the path ahead. out of the gloom came suddenly the shape of a flying deer. it 
charged into the dwarves and bowled them over, then gathered itself for a leap. high it 
sprang and cleared the water with a mighty jump. but it did not reach the other side in 
safety. 
thorin was the only one who had kept his feet and his wits. as soon as they had landed 
he had bent his bow and fitted an arrow in case any hidden guardian of the boat 
appeared. now he sent a swift and sure shot into the leaping beast. as it reached the 
further bank it stumbled. the shadows swallowed it up, but they heard the sound o

 and as they sat it seemed they 
could hear the noise of a great hunt going by to the north of the path, though they saw 
no sign of it. 
there they sat for a long while and did not dare to make a move. bombur slept on with a 
smile on his fat face, as if he no longer cared for all the troubles that vexed them. 
suddenly on the path ahead appeared some white deer, a hind and fawns as snowy 
white as the hart had been dark. they glimmered in the shadows. before thorin could 
cry out three of the dwarves had leaped to their feet and loosed off arrows from their 
bows. none seemed to find their mark. the deer turned and vanished in the trees as 
silently as they had come, and in vain the dwarves shot their arrows after them. 
"stop! stop!" shouted thorin; but it was too late, the excited dwarves had wasted their 
last arrows, and now the bows that beorn had given them were useless. 
they were a gloomy party that night, and the gloom gathered still deeper on them in the 
following days. they had

ter a dreadful struggle in a difficult place where 
there seemed to be no convenient branches at all, he got near the top. all the time he 
was wondering whether there were spiders in the tree, and how he was going to get 
down again (except by falling). 
in the end he poked his head above the roof of leaves, and then he found spiders all 
right. but they were only small ones of ordinary size, and they were after the butterflies. 
bilbo's eyes were nearly blinded by the light. he could hear the dwarves shouting up at 
him from far below, but he could not answer, only hold on and blink. the sun was 
shining brilliantly, and it was a long while before he could bear it. when he could, he saw 
all round him a sea of dark green, ruffled here and there by the breeze; and there were 
everywhere hundreds of butterflies. i expect they were a kind of 'purple emperor,' a

he looked at the 'black emperors' for a long time, and enjoyed the feel of the breeze in 
his hair and on his face; but at length the cries of the dwarves, who were now simply 
stamping with impatience down below, reminded him of his real business. it was no 
good. gaze as much as he might, he could see no end to the trees and the leaves in any 
direction. his heart, that had been lightened by the sight of the sun and the feel of the 
wind, sank back into his toes: there was no food to go back to down below. 
actually, as i have told you, they were not far off the edge of the forest; and if bilbo had

thought was a log, and he found it was the hobbit curled up fast 
asleep. it took a deal of shaking to wake him, and when he was awake he was not 
pleased at all. 
"i was having such a lovely dream," he grumbled, "all about having a most gorgeous 
dinner." 
"good heavens! he has gone like bombur," they said. "don't tell us about dreams. 
dream-dinners aren't any good, and we can't share them." 
"they are the best i am likely to get in this beastly place," he muttered, as he lay down 
beside the dwarves and tried to go back to sleep and find his dream again. but that was 
not the last of the lights in the forest. 
later when the night must have been getting old, kili who was watching then, came and 
roused them all again, saying: 
"there's a regular blaze of light begun not far away - hundreds of torches and many fires 
must have been lit suddenly and by magic. and hark to the singing and the harps!" 
after lying and listening for a while, they found they could not resist the desire to go

 were passing bowls from hand to hand and across the fires, and some were 
harping and many were singing. their gloaming hair was twined with flowers; green and 
white gems glinted on their collars and their belts; and their faces and their songs were 
filled with mirth. loud and clear and fair were those songs, and out stepped thorin into 
their midst. 
dead silence fell in the middle of a word. out went all light. the fires leaped up in black 
smokes. ashes and cinders were in the eyes of the dwarves, and the wood was filled 
again with their clamour and their cries. bilbo found himself running round and round (as 
he thought) and calling and calling: 
"dori, nori, ori, oin, gloin, fili, kili, bombur, bifur, bofur, dwalin, balin, 
thorin oakenshield," while people he could not see or feel were doing the same all 
round him (with an occasional "bilbo!" thrown in). but the cries of the others got steadily 
further and fainter, and though after a while it seemed to him they changed to yells an

jerks, until he killed it with another stroke; and then he fell down and remembered 
nothing more for a long while. 
there was the usual dim grey light of the forest-day about him when he came to his 
senses. the spider lay dead beside him, and his sword-blade was stained black. 
somehow the killing of the giant spider, all alone by himself in the dark without the help 
of the wizard or the dwarves or of anyone else, made a great difference to mr. baggins. 
he felt a different person, and much fiercer and bolder in spite of an empty stomach, as 
he wiped his sword on the grass and put it back into its sheath. 
"i will give you a name," he said to it, "and i shall call you sting." 
after that he set out to explore. the forest was grim and silent, but obviously he had first

bilbo felt that it was unsafe to shout, and he stood a long while wondering in what 
direction the path lay, and in what direction he should go first to look for the dwarves. "o! 
why did we not remember beorn's advice, and gandalf's!" he lamented. "what a mess 
we are in now! we! i only wish it was we: it is horrible being all alone." 
in the end he made as good a guess as he could at the direction from which the cries for 
help had come in the night - and by luck (he was born with a good share of it) be 
guessed more or less right, as you will see. having made up his mind he crept along as 
cleverly as he could. hobbits are clever at quietness, especially in wood

enly he saw, too, that there were spiders huge and horrible sitting in the branches 
above him, and ring or no ring he trembled with fear lest they should discover him. 
standing behind a tree he watched a group of them for some time, and then in the 
silence and stillness of the wood he realised that these loathsome creatures were 
speaking one to another. their voices were a sort of thin creaking and hissing, but he 
could make out many of the words that they said. they were talking about the dwarves! 
"it was a sharp struggle, but worth it," said one. "what nasty thick skins they have to be 
sure, but i'll wager there is good juice inside." 
"aye, they'll make fine eating, when they've hung a bit," said another. 
"don't hang 'em too long," said a third. "they're not as fat as they might be. been 
feeding none too well of late, i should guess." 
"kill'em, i say," hissed a fourth; "kill 'em now and hang 'em dead for a while." 
"they're dead now, i'll warrant," said the first.

the spider had reached bombur, and soon he would have been dead. at that moment 
bilbo threw. the stone struck the spider plunk on the head, and it dropped senseless off 
the tree, flop to the ground, with all its legs curled up. 
the next stone went whizzing through a big web, snapping its cords, and taking off the 
spider sitting in the middle of it, whack, dead. after that there was a deal of commotion in 
the spider-colony, and they forgot the dwarves for a bit, i can tell you. they could not 
see bilbo, but they could make a good guess at the direction from which the stones were 
coming. as quick as lightning they came running and swinging towards the hobbit, 
flinging out their long threads in all directions, till the air seemed full of waving snares. 
bilbo, however, soon slipped away to a different place. the idea came to him to lead the 
furious spiders further and further away from the dwarves, if he could; to make them

ed and angry all at once. when about fifty had gone off to the place where 
he had stood before, he threw some more stones at these, and at others that had 
stopped behind; then dancing among the trees he began to sing a song to infuriate them 
and bring them all after him, and also to let the dwarves hear his voice. 
this is what he sang: 
 
"old fat spider spinning in a tree! 
old fat spider can't see me! 
attercop! attercop! 
won't you stop, 
stop your spinning and look for me!

the spiders saw the sword, though i don't suppose they knew what it was, and at once 
the whole lot of them came hurrying after the hobbit along the ground and the branches, 
hairy legs waving, nippers and spinners snapping, eyes popping, full of froth and rage. 
they followed him into the forest until bilbo had gone as far as he dared. 
then quieter than a mouse he stole back. he had precious little time, he knew, before 
the spiders were disgusted and came back to their trees where the dwarves were hung. 
in the meanwhile he had to rescue them. the worst part of the job was getting up on to 
the long branch where the bundles were dangling. 
i don't suppose he would have managed it, if a spider had not luckily left a rope hanging 
down; with its help, though it stuck to his hand and hurt him, he scrambled up-only to 
meet an old slow wicked fat-bodied spider who had remained behind to guard the 
prisoners, and had been busy pinching them to see which was the juiciest to eat. it had

hought of starting the feast while the others were away, but mr. baggins was in a hurry, 
and before the spider knew what was happening it felt his sting and rolled off the branch 
dead. bilbo's next job was to loose a dwarf. what was he to do? if he cut the string 
which hung him up, the wretched dwarf would tumble thump to the ground a good way 
below. wriggling along the branch (which made all the poor dwarves dance and 
dangle like ripe fruit) he reached the first bundle. 
"fili or kili," he thought by the tip of a blue hood sticking out at the top. "most likely fili," 
he thought by the tip of a long nose poking out of the winding threads. he managed by 
leaning over to cut most of the strong sticky threads that bound him round, and then, 
sure enough, with a kick and a struggle most of fili emerged. i am afraid bilbo actually 
laughed at the sight of him jerking his stiff arms and legs as he dance

 slash them free. none of them were better off than fili, 
and some of them were worse. some had hardly been able to breathe at all (long noses 
are sometimes useful you see), and some had been more poisoned. 
in this way they rescued kili, bifur, bofur, don and nori. poor old bombur was so 
exhausted-he was the fattest and had been constantly pinched and poked-that he just 
rolled off the branch and fell plop on to the ground, fortunately on to leaves, and lay 
there. but there were still five dwarves hanging at the end of the branch when the 
spiders began to come back, more full of rage than ever. bilbo immediately went to the 
end of the branch nearest the tree-trunk and kept back those that crawled up. he had 
taken off his ring when he rescued fili and forgotten to put it on again, so now they all 
began to splutter and hiss: 
 
"now we see you, you nasty little creature! we will eat you and leave your bones and 
skin hanging on a tree. ugh! he's got a sting has he? well, we'll get him

all the same, 
and then we'll hang him head downwards for a day or two." 
 
while this was going on, the other dwarves were working at the rest of the captives, and 
cutting at the threads with their knives. soon all would be free, though it was not clear 
what would happen after that. the spiders had caught them pretty easily the night 
before, but that had been unawares and in the dark. this time there looked like being a 
horrible battle. 
suddenly bilbo noticed that some of the spiders had gathered round old bombur on the 
floor, and had tied him up again and were dragging him away. he gave a shout and

down the tree right into the middle of those on the ground. his little sword was 
something new in the way of stings for them. 
how it darted to and fro! it shone with delight as he stabbed at them. half a dozen were 
killed before the rest drew off and left bombur to bilbo. 
"come down! come down!" he shouted to the dwarves on the branch. "don't stay up 
there and be netted!" for he saw spiders swarming up all the neighboring trees, and 
crawling along the boughs above the heads of the dwarves. 
down the dwarves scrambled or jumped or dropped, eleven all in a heap, most of them 
very shaky and little use on their legs. there they were at last, twelve of them counting

brother bofur; and bilbo was dancing about and waving his sti

spiders were goggling at them all round and about and above. it looked pretty hopeless. 
then the battle began. some of the dwarves had knives, and some had sticks, and all of 
them could get at stones; and bilbo had his elvish dagger. 
again and again the spiders were beaten off, and many of them were killed. but it could 
not go on for long. bilbo was nearly tired out; only four of the dwarves were able to stand 
firmly, and soon they would all be overpowered like weary flies. already the spiders were 
beginning to weave their webs all round them again from tree to tree. in the end bilbo 
could think of no plan except to let the dwarves into the secret of his ring. he was rather 
sorry about it, but it could not be helped. 

"i am going to disappear," he said. "i shall draw the spiders off, if i can; and you must 
keep together and make in the opposite direction. to the left there,

that is more or less 
the way towards the place where we last saw the elf-fires." 
it was difficult to get them to understand, what with their dizzy heads, and the shouts, 
and the whacking of sticks and the throwing of stones; but at last bilbo felt he could 
delay no longer-the spiders were drawing their circle ever closer. he suddenly slipped on 
his ring, and to the great astonishment of the dwarves he vanished. 
soon there came the sound of "lazy lob" and "attercop" from among the trees away on 
the right. that upset the spiders greatly. they stopped advancing, and some, went off in 
the direction of the voice. "attercop" made them so angry that they lost their wits. then 
balin, who had grasped bilbo's plan better than the rest, led an attack. the dwarves 
huddled together in a knot, and sending a shower of stones they drove at the spiders on 
the left, and burst through the ring. away b

nd spluttered and frothed, 
and hissed out horrible curses; but they had become mortally afraid of sting, and dared 
not come very near, now that it had come back. so curse as they would, their prey 
moved slowly but steadily away. it was a most terrible business, and seemed to take 
hours. but at last, just when bilbo felt that he could not lift his hand for a single stroke 
more, the spiders suddenly gave it up, and followed them no more, but went back 
disappointed to their dark colony. 
the dwarves then noticed that they had come to the edge of a ring where elf-fires had 
been. whether it was one of those they had seen the night before, they could not tell. 
but it seemed that some good magic lingered in such spots, which the spiders did not 
like. at any rate here the light was greener, and the boughs less thick and threatening, 
and they had a chance to rest and draw breath. 
there they lay for some time, puffing and panting. put very soon they began to ask 
questions. they had to have

"gollum! well i'm blest! so that's how he sneaked past me is it? now i know! just crept 
quietly along did you, mr. baggins? buttons all over the doorstep? good old bilbo-bilbo-
bilbo-bo-bo-bo-" and then he fell asleep, and there was complete silence for a long time. 
all of a sudden dwalin opened an eye, and looked round at them. "where is thorin?" he 
asked. it was a terrible shock. of course there were only thirteen of them, twelve 
dwarves and the hobbit. where indeed was thorin? they wondered what evil fate had 
befallen him, magic or dark monsters; and shuddered as they lay lost in the forest. there 
they dropped off one by one into uncomfortable sleep full of horrible dreams, as evening 
wore to black night; and there we must leave them for the present, too sick and weary to 
set guards or take turns watching. 
thorin had been caught much faster than they had. you remember bilbo falling like a log 
into sleep, as he stepped in

to a circle of light? the next time it had been thorin who 
stepped forward, and as the lights went out he fell like a stone enchanted. all the noise 
of the dwarves lost in the night, their cries as the spiders caught them and bound them, 
and all the sounds of the battle next day, had passed over him unheard. then the wood-
elves had come to him, and bound him, and carried him away. the feasting people were 
woodelves, of course. these are not wicked folk. if they have a fault it is distrust of 
strangers. though their magic was strong, even in those days they were wary. they 
differed from the high elves of the west, and were more dangerous and less wise

fact the subjects of the king mostly lived and hunted in the open woods, and had houses 
or huts on the ground and in the branches. the beeches were their favourite trees. the 
king's cave was his palace, and the strong place of his treasure, and the fortress of his 
people against their enemies. 

it was also the dungeon of his prisoners. so to the cave they dragged thorin - not too 
gently, for they did not love dwarves, and thought he was an enemy. in ancient days 
they had had wars with some of the dwarves, whom they accused of stealing their 
treasure. it is only fair to say that the dwarves gave a different account, and said that 
they only took what was their due, for the elf-king had bar- gained with them to shape his 
raw gold and silver, and had afterwards refused to give them their pay. if the elf-king had 
a weakness it was for treasure, especially for silver and white gems; and though his 
hoard was

friends. it was not very long before he discovered; but that belongs to the next chapter 
and the beginning of another adventure in which the hobbit again showed his 
usefulness.

barrels out of bond 
 
the day after the battle with the spiders bilbo and the dwarves made one last despairing 
effort to find a way out before they died of hunger and thirst. they got up and staggered 
on in the direction which eight out of the thirteen of them guessed to be the one in which 
the path lay; but they never found out if they were right. such day as there ever was in 
the forest was fading once more into the blackness of night, when suddenly out sprang 
the light of many torches all round them, like hundreds of red stars. out leaped wood-
elves with their bows and

there was no thought of a fight. even if the dwarves had not been in such a state that 
they were actually glad to be captured, their small knives, the only weapons they had, 

would have been of no use against the arrows of the elves that could hit a bird's eye in 
the dark. so they simply stopped dead and sat down and waited-all except bilbo, who 
popped on his ring and slipped quickly to one side. 
that is why, when the elves bound the dwarves in a long line, one behind the other, and 
counted them, they never found or counted the hobbit. nor did they hear or feel him 
trotting along well behind their torch-light as they led off their prisoners into the forest. 
each dwarf was blindfold, but that did not make much difference, for even bilbo with the 
use of his eyes could not see where they were going, and neither he nor the others knew 
where they had started from anyway. bilbo had all he could do to keep up with the 
torches, for t

weary as they were. the king had ordered them to make haste. suddenly the torches 
stopped, and the hobbit had just time to catch them up before they began to cross the 
bridge. this was the bridge that led across the river to the king's doors. the water flowed

huge cave that ran into the side of a steep slope covered with trees. there the great

carven staff of oak. 
the prisoners were brought before him; and though he looked grimly at them, he told his 
men to unbind them, for they were ragged and weary. "besides they need no ropes in 
here," said he. "there is no escape from my magic doors for those who are once 
brought inside." 
long and searchingly he questioned the dwarves about their doings, and where they 
were going to, and where they were coming from; but he got little more news out of them 
than out of thorin. they were surly and angry and did not even pretend to be polite. 
"what have we done, o king?" said balin, who was the eldest left. "is it a crime to be lost 
in the forest, to be hungry and thirsty, to be trapped by spiders? are the spiders your 
tame beasts or your pets, if killing them makes you angry?" such a question of course 
made the king angri

without leave. do you forget that you were in my kingdom, using the road that my people 
made? did you not three times pursue and trouble my people in the forest and ' rouse 
the spiders with your riot and clamour? after all the disturbance you have made i have a 
right to know what brings you here, and if you will not tell me now, i will keep you all in 
prison until you have learned sense and manners!" 
then he ordered the dwarves each to be put in a separate cell and to be given food and 
drink, but not to be allowed to pass the doors of their little prisons, until one at least of 
them was willing to tell him all he wanted to know. but be did not tell them that thorin 
was also a prisoner with him. it was bilbo who found that out.

always in hiding, never daring to take off his ring, hardly daring to sleep, even tucked

 the lands to the east. 
then if bilbo was very nimble, he could slip out just behind them; though it was a 
dangerous thing to do. more than once he was nearly caught in the doors, as they 
clashed together when the last elf passed; yet he did not dare to march among them 
because of his shadow (altogether thin and wobbly as it was in torch-light), or for fear of 
being bumped into and discovered. and when he did go out, which was not very often, 
he did no good. 
he did not wish to desert the dwarves, and indeed he did not know where in the world to 
go without them. he could not keep up with the hunting elves all the time they were out, 
so he never discovered the ways out of the wood, and was left to wander miserably in 
the forest, terrified of losing himself, until a chance came of returning. he was hungry too 
outside, for he was no hunter; but inside the caves he could pick up a living of some sort 
by stealing food from store or table when no one was at hand. "i am like a burglar tha

he got to know his way about very well. what was his surprise one day to overhear 
some of the guards talking and to learn that there was another dwarf in prison too, in a 
specially deep dark place. he guessed at once, of course, that that was thorin; and after 
a while he found that his guess was right. at last after many difficulties he managed to 
find the place when no one was about, and to have a word with the chief of the dwarves. 
thorin was too wretched to be angry any longer at his misfortunes, and was even 
beginning to think of telling the king all about his treasure and his quest (which shows 
how low-spirited he had become), when he heard bilbo's little voice at his keyhole. he 
could hardly believe his ears. soon however he made up his mind that he could not be 
mistaken, and he came to the door and had a long whispered talk with the hobbit on the 
other side. 
so it was that bilbo was able to take secretly thor

imprisoned dwarves, telling them that thorin their chief was also in prison close at hand, 
and that no one was to reveal their errand to the long, not yet, not before thorin gave 
the word. for thorin had taken heart again hearing how the hobbit had rescued his 
companions from the spiders, and was determined once more not to ransom himself 
with promises to the king of a share in the treasure, until all hope of escaping in any 
other way had disappeared; until in fact the remarkable mr. invisible baggins (of wh

he began to have a very high opinion indeed) had altogether failed to think of 
something clever. 
the other dwarves quite agreed when they got the message. they all thought their own 
shares in the treasure (which they quite regarded as theirs, in spite of their plight and the 
still unconquered dragon) would suffer seriously if the wood-elves claimed part of it, and 
they all trusted bilbo. 
just what gandalf had said would happen, you see. perhaps that war part of his reason 
for going off and leaving them.

far from the cellars. 
"upon my word!" said thorin, when bilbo whispered to him to come out and join his 
friends, "gandalf spoke true, as usual. a pretty fine burglar you make, it seems, when 
the time comes. i am sure we are all for ever at your service, whatever happens after 
this. but what comes next?" 
bilbo saw that the time had come to explain his idea, as far as he could; but he did not 
feel at all sure bow the dwarves would take it. his fears were quite justified, for they did 
not like it a bit, and started grumbling loudly in spite of their danger. 
"we shall be bruised and battered to pieces, and drowned too, for certain!" they 
muttered. "we thought you had got some sensible notion, when you managed to get 
hold of the keys. this is a mad idea!" 
"very well!" said bilbo very downcast, and also rather annoyed. "come along back to

rows in the middle of the floor waiting to 
be pushed off. some of them were wine-barrels, and these were not much use, as they 
could not easily be opened at the end without a deal of noise, nor could they easily be 
secured again. but among them were several others which had been used for bringing 
other stuffs, butter, apples, and all sorts of things, to the king's palace. 
they soon found thirteen with room enough for a dwarf in each. in fact some were too 
roomy, and as they climbed in the dwarves thought anxiously of the shaking and the 
bumping they would get inside, though bilbo did his best to find straw and other stuff to 
pack them in as cosily as could be managed in a short time. at last twelve dwarves were 
stowed. thorin had given a lot of trouble, and turned and twisted in his tub and grumbled 
like a large dog in a small kennel; while balin, who came last, made a great fuss about 
his airholes and said he was stifling, even before his lid was on. bilbo had done what he

barrel himself, nor was there anyone to pack him in, even if there had been a chance! it 
looked as if he would certainly lose his friends this time (nearly all of them had already 
disappeared through the dark trap-door), and get utterly left behind and have to stay 
lurking as a permanent burglar in the elf-caves for ever. for even if he could have 
escaped through the upper gates at once, he had precious small chance of ever finding 
the dwarves again. he did not know the way by land to the place where the barrels were 
collected. he wondered what on earth would happen to them without him; for he had not 
had time to tell the dwarves all that he had learned, or what he had meant to do, once 
they were out of the wood. while all these thoughts were passing through his mind, the 
elves being very merry began to sing a song round the river-door. some had already 
gone to haul on the ropes which pulled up the portcullis at the water-gate s

hustled and battered to bits; but at last the jostling crowd began to break up and swing 
off, one by one, under the stone arch and away. then he saw that it would have been no

out they went under the overhanging branches of the trees on either bank. 
bilbo wondered what the dwarves were feeling and whether a lot of water was getting 
into their tubs. some of those that bobbed along by him in the gloom seemed pretty low 
in the water, and he guessed that these had dwarves inside. 
"i do hope i put the lids on tight enough!" he thought, but before long he was worrying 
too much about himself to remember the dwarves. he managed to keep his head above 
the water, but he was shivering with the cold, and he wondered if he would die of it

this had a shingly shore under hanging banks and was walled at the eastern end by a 
little jutting cape of hard rock. on the shallow shore most of the barrels ran aground, 
though a few went on to bump against the stony pier. 
there were people on the look-out on the banks. they quickly poled and pushed all the 
barrels together into the shallows, and when they had counted them they roped them 
together and left them till the morning. poor dwarves!

sneaked along to some huts that he could see near the water's edge. 
he no longer thought twice about picking up a supper uninvited if he got the chance, he 
had been obliged to do it for so long, and he knew only too well what it was to be really 
hungry, not merely politely interested in the dainties of a well-filled larder. also he had 
caught a glimpse of a fire through the trees, and that appealed to

adventures to see it, and now he did not like the look of it in the least. 

as he listened to the talk of the raftmen and pieced together the scraps of information 
they let fall, he soon realized that he was very fortunate ever to have seen it at all, even 
from this distance. dreary as had been his imprisonment and unpleasant as was his 
position (to say nothing of the poor dwarves underneath him) still, he had been more 
lucky than he had guessed. the talk was all of the trade that came and went on the 
waterways and the growth of the traffic on the river, as the roads out of the east towards 
mirkwood vanished or fell into disuse; and of the bickerings of the lake-men and the 
wood-elves about the upkeep of the forest river and the care of the banks. 
those lands had changed much since the days when dwarves dwelt in the mountain, 
days which most people now remembered o

great floods and rains had swollen the waters that flowed east; and there had been an 
earthquake or two (which some were inclined to attribute to the dragon-alluding to him 
chiefly with a curse and an ominous nod in the direction of the mountain). the marshes 
and bogs had spread wider and wider on either side. paths had vanished, and many a 
rider and wanderer too, if they had tried to find the lost ways across. the elf-road 
through the wood which the dwarves had followed on the advice of beorn now came to a 
doubtful and little used end at the eastern edge of the forest; only the river offered any 
longer a safe way from the skirts of mirkwood in the north to the mountain-shadowed 
plains beyond, and the river was guarded by the wood-elves' king. 
so you see bilbo had come in the end by the only road that was any good.

now dirty and tattered sky-blue hood with its tarnished silver tassel. it was some time 
before he would be even polite to the hobbit. 
"well, are you alive or are you dead?" asked bilbo quite crossly. perhaps he had 
forgotten that he had had at least one good meal more than the dwarves, and also the 
use of his arms and legs, not to speak of a greater allowance of air. "are you still in 
prison, or are you free? if you want food, and if you want to go on with this silly 
adventure- it's yours after all and not mine-you had better slap your arms and rub your 
legs and try and help me get the others out while there is a chance!" 
thorin of course saw the sense of this, so after a few more groans he got up and helped 
the hobbit as well as he could. in the darkness floundering i

occasional squabbles about river-tolls they were friends with the wood-elves. other folk 
were far away; and some of the younger people in the town openly doubted the 
existence of any dragon in the mountain, and laughed at the greybeards and gammers 
who said that they had seen him flying in the sky in their young days. that being so it is 
not surprising that the guards were drinking and laughing by a fire in their hut, and did 
not hear the noise of the unpacking of the dwarves or the footsteps of the four scouts. 
their astonishment was enormous when thorin oakenshield stepped in through the 
door. 
"who are you and what do you want?" they shouted leaping to their feet and gipping for 
weapons. 
"thorin son of thrain son of thror king under the mountain!" said the dwarf in a loud 
voice, and he looked it, in spite of his torn clothes and draggled hood. the gold gleamed 
on his neck and waist: his eyes were dark and deep. "i have come back. i wish to see

"i am thorin son of thrain son of thror king under the mountain! i return!" cried thorin 
in a loud voice from the door, before the captain could say anything. all leaped to their 
feet. the master of the town sprang from his great chair. but none rose in greater 
surprise than the raft-men of the elves who were sitting at the lower end of the hall. 
pressing forward before the master's table they cried: 
"these are prisoners of our king that have escaped, wandering vagabond dwarves that 
could not give any good account of themselves, sneaking through the woods and 
molesting our people!" 
"is this true?" asked the master. as a matter of fact he thought it far more likely than the 
return of the king under the mountain, if any such person had ever existed. 
"it is true that we were wrongfully waylaid by the elven-king and imprisoned without 
cause as we journeyed back to our own land," answered thorin. "but lock nor bar may 
hinder the homecoming spoken of old. nor is this

e a serious mistake. 

as for the master he saw there was nothing else for it but to obey the general clamour, 
for the moment at any rate, and to pretend to believe that thorin was what he said. so 
he gave up to him his own great chair and set fili and kili beside him in places of 
honour. even bilbo was given a seat at the high table, and no explanation of where he 
came in-no songs had alluded to him even in the obscurest way-was asked for in the 
general bustle. 
soon afterwards the other dwarves were brought into the town amid scenes of 
astonishing enthusiasm. they were all doctored and fed and housed and pampered in 
the most delightful and satisfactory fashion. a large house was given up to thorin and 
his company; boats and rowers were put at their service; and crowds sat outside and 
sang songs all day, or cheered if any dwarf showed so much as his nose. 
some of the songs were old ones; but some of them were quite new and spoke 
confidently of the sudden death of the dragon and o

down the river to lake-town. these were inspired largely by the master and they did not 
particularly please the dwarves, but in the meantime they were well contented and they 
quickly grew fat and strong again. 
indeed within a week they were quite recovered, fitted out in fine cloth of their proper 
colours, with beards combed and trimmed, and proud steps. thorin looked and walked 
as if his kingdom was already regained and smaug chopped up into little pieces. 
then, as he had said, the dwarves' good feeling towards the little hobbit grew stronger 
every day. there were no more groans or grumbles. they drank hi

the thought of the dragon, and he had besides a shocking cold. for three days he 
sneezed and coughed, and he could not go out, and even after that his speeches at 
banquets were limited to "thag you very buch." 
in the meanwhile the wood-elves had gone back up the forest river with their cargoes, 
and there was great excitement in the king's palace. i have never heard what happened 
to the chief of the guards and the butler. nothing of course was ever said about keys or 
barrels while the dwarves stayed in lake-town, and bilbo was careful never to become 
invisible. still, i daresay, more was guessed than was known, though doubtless mr. 
baggins remained a bit of a mystery. in any case the king knew now the dwarves' 
errand, or thought he did, and he said to himself: 
"very well! we'll see! no treasure will come back through mirkwood without my having 
something to say in the matter. but i expect they will all come to a bad end, and serve 
them right!" he at any rate did not believe in

he was a wise elf and wiser than the men of the town, though not quite right, as we shall 
see in the end. he sent out his spies about the shores of the lake and as far northward 
towards the mountains as they would go, and waited. 
at the end of a fortnight thorin began to think of departure. while the enthusiasm still 
lasted in the town was the time to get help. it would n

ot do to let everything cool down 
with delay. so he spoke to the master and his councillors and said that soon he and his 
company must go on towards the mountain. 
then for the first time the master was surprised and a little frightened; and he wondered 
if thorin was after all really a descendant of the old kings. 
he had never thought that the dwarves would actually dare to approach smaug, but 
believed they were frauds who would sooner or later be discovered and be turned out. 
he was wrong. thorin, of course, was really the grandson of the king under the 
mountain, and there is no knowing what a dwarf will not dare and do for revenge or the 
recovery of his own. but the master was not sorry at all to let them go. they were 

expensive to keep, and their arrival had turned things into a long holiday in which 
business was at a standstill.

"let them go and bother smaug, and see how he welcomes them!" he thought. 
"certainly, o thorin thrain's son thror's son!" was what he said. "you must claim your 
own. the hour is at hand, spoken of old. what help we can offer shall be yours, and we 
trust to your gratitude when your kingdom is regained." 
so one day, although autumn was now getting far on, and winds were cold, and leaves 
were falling fast, three large boats left lake-town, laden with rowers, dwarves, mr. 
baggins, and many provisions. horses and ponies had been sent round by circuitous 
paths to meet them at their appointed landing-place. 
the master and his councillors bade them farewell from the great steps of the town-hall 
that went down to the lake. people sang on the quays and out of windows. the white 
oars dipped and splashed, and off they went north up the lake on the last stage of their 
long journey. the only person thoroughly unhappy was bilbo.

h autumn was now crawling towards winter that pleasant time now 
seemed years ago. they were alone in the perilous waste without hope of further help. 
they were at the end of their journey, but as far as ever, it seemed, from the end of their 
quest. none of them had much spirit left. 
now strange to say mr. baggins had more than the others. he would often borrow 
thorin's map and gaze at it, pondering over the runes and the message of the moon-
letters elrond had read. it was he that made the dwarves begin the dangerous search on 
the western slopes for the secret door. they moved their camp then to a long valley, 
narrower than the great dale in the south where the gates of the river stood, and walled 
with lower spurs of the mountain. two of these here thrust forward west from the main 
mass in long steep-sided ridges that fell ever downwards towards the plain. on this 
western side there were fewer signs of the dragon's marauding feet, and there was 
some grass for their ponies. from thi

their camp without success. 
but at last unexpectedly they found what they were seeking. fili and kili and the hobbit 
went back one day down the valley and scrambled among the tumbled rocks at its 
southern corner. about midday, creeping behind a great stone that stood alone like a 

pillar, bilbo came on what looked like rough steps going upwards. following these 
excitedly he and the dwarves found traces of a narrow track, often lost, often 
rediscovered, that wandered on to the top of the southern ridge and brought them at last 
to a still narrower ledge, which turned north across the face of the mountain. looking 
down they saw that they were at the top of the cliff at the valley's head and were gazing 
down on to their own camp below. silently, clinging to the rocky wall on their right, they 
went in single file along the ledge, till the wall opened and they turned into a little

 and so to the narrow ledge. along this they could carry no bundles 
or packs, so narrow and breathless was it, with a fall of a hundred and fifty feet beside 
them on to sharp rocks below; but each of them took a good coil of rope wound tight 
about his waist, and so at last without mishap they reached the little grassy bay. 
there they made their third camp, hauling up what they needed from below with their 
ropes. down the same way they were able occasionally to lower one of the more active 
dwarves, such as kili, to exchange such news as there was, or to take a share in the 
guard below, while bofur was hauled up to the higher camp. bombur would not come up 
either the rope or the path. 
"i am too fat for such fly-walks," he said. "i should turn dizzy and tread on my beard, and 
then you would be thirteen again. and the knotted ropes are too slender for my weight." 
luckily for him that was not true, as you will see. 
in the meanwhile some of them explored the ledge beyond the opening and

party in his hobbit-hole, when he said they could sit on the doorstep till they thought of 

something. and sit and think they did, or wandered aimlessly about, and glummer and 
glummer they became. 
their spirits had risen a little at the discovery of the path, but now they sank into their 
boots; and yet they would not give it up and go away. the hobbit was no longer much 
brighter than the dwarves. he would do nothing but sit with his back to the rock-face and 
stare away west through the opening, over the cliff, over the wide lands to the black wall 
of mirkwood, and to the distances beyond, in which he sometimes thought he could 
catch glimpses of the misty mountains small and far. if the dwarves asked him what he 
was doing he answered: 
"you said sitting on the doorstep and thinking would be my job, not to mention getting 
inside, so i am sitting and thinking." but i am afraid he was

g its sides. 
"tomorrow begins the last week of autumn," said thorin one day. 
"and winter comes after autumn," said bifur. 
"and next year after that," said dwalin, "and our beards will grow till they hang down the 
cliff to the valley before anything happens here. what is our burglar doing for us? 
since he has got an invisible ring, and ought to be a specially excellent performer now, i 
am beginning to think he might go through the front gate and spy things out a bit!" 
bilbo heard this-the dwarves were on the rocks just : above the enclosure where he was 
sitting-and "good gracious!" he thought, "so that is what they are beginning to think, is 
it? it is always poor me that has to get them out : of their difficulties, at least since the 
wizard left. whatever am i going to do? i might have known that something dreadful 
would happen to me in the end. 
i don't think i could bear to see the unhappy valley of dale again, and as for that 
steaming gate! ! !" 
that night he was very miserable

 and hardly slept. next day the dwarves all went 
wandering off in various directions; some were exercising the ponies down below, some 
were roving about the mountain-side. all day bilbo sat gloomily in the grassy bay gazing 
at the stone, or out west through the narrow opening. he had a queer feeling that he was 
waiting for something. "perhaps the wizard will suddenly come back today," he thought. 
if he lifted his head he could see a glimpse of the distant forest. as the sun turned west 
there was a gleam of yellow upon its far r

nge ball of the sun sinking towards the level of his eyes. he went to 
the opening and there pale and faint was a thin new moon above the rim of earth. at that 
very moment he heard a sharp crack behind him. there on the grey stone in the grass 
was an enormous thrush, nearly coal black, its pale yellow breast freckled dark spots. 
crack! it had caught a snail and was knocking it on the stone. crack! 
crack! 
suddenly bilbo understood. forgetting all danger he stood on the ledge and hailed the 
dwarves, shouting and paying. those that were nearest came tumbling over the rocks 
and as fast as they could along the ledge to him, wondering what on earth was the 
matter; the others shouted to be hauled up the ropes (except bombur, of course: he was 
asleep). 
quickly bilbo explained. they all fell silent: the hobbit standing by the grey stone, and 
the dwarves with wagging beards watching impatiently. the sun sank lower and lower, 
and their hopes fell. it sank into a belt of reddened cloud and di

groaned, but still bilbo stood almost without moving. the little moon was dipping to the 

horizon. evening was coming on. then suddenly when their hope was lowest a red ray 
of the sun escaped like a finger through a rent in the cloud. a gleam of light came 
straight through the opening into the bay and fell on the smooth rock-face. the old 
thrush, who had been watching from a high perch with beady eyes and head cocked on 
one side, gave a sudden trill. there was a loud attack. a flake of r

and fell. a hole appeared suddenly about three feet from the ground. 
quickly, trembling lest the chance should fade, the dwarves rushed to the rock and 
pushed-in vain. 
"the key! the key!" cried bilbo. "where is thorin?" 
thorin hurried up. 
"the key!" shouted bilbo. "the key that went with the map! try it now while there is still 
time!" 
then thorin stepped up and drew the key on its chain from round his neck. 
he put it to the hole. it fitted and it turned! snap! the gleam went out, the sun sank, the 
moon was gone, and evening sprang into the sky. 
now they all pushed together, and slowly a part of the rock-wall gav

cracks appeared and widened. a door five feet high and three broad was out- lined, and 
slowly without a sound swung inwards. it seemed as if darkness flowed out like a vapour 
from the hole in the mountainside, and deep darkness in which nothing could be seen 
lay before their eyes mouth leading in and down.

for a long time the dwarves stood in the dark before the door and debated, until at last 
thorin spoke: 
"now is the time for our esteemed mr. baggins, who has proved himself a good 
companion on our long road, and a hobbit full of courage and resource far exceeding his 
size, and if i may say so possessed of good luck far exceeding the usual allowance-now 
is the time for him to perform the service for which he was included in our company; 
now is the time for him to earn his reward."

s ago - 
"but anyway i think i will go and have a peep at once and get it over. now who is coming 
with me?" 
he did not expect a chorus of volunteers, so he was not disappointed. 
fili and kili looked uncomfortable and stood on one leg, but the others made no 
pretence of offering - except old balin. the look-out man, who was rather fond the hobbit. 
he said he would come inside at least and perhaps a bit of the way too, really to call for 
help if necessary. 
the most that can be said for the dwarves is this: they intended to pay bilbo really 
handsomely for his services; they had brought him to do a nasty job for them, and they 

did not mind the poor little fellow doing it if he would; but they would all have done their 
best to get him out of trouble, if he got into it, as they did in the case of the trolls at the 
beginning of their adventures before they had any particular reasons for being grateful to 
him. there it is: dwarves are not heroes, but calculating folk with a great idea o

value of money; some are tricky and treacherous and pretty bad lots; some are not, but 
are decent enough people like thorin and company, if you don't expect too much. 
the stars were coming out behind him in a pale sky barred with black when the hobbit 
crept through the enchanted door and stole into the mountain. it was far easier going 
than he expected. this was no goblin entrance, or rough wood-elves' cave. it was a 
passage made by dwarves, at the height of their wealth and skill: straight as a ruler, 
smooth-floored and smooth-sided, going with a gentle never-varying slope direct-to 
some distant end in the blackness below. 
after a while balin bade bilbo "good luck!" and stopped where he could still see the faint 
outline of the door, and by a trick of, the echoes of the tunnel hear the rustle of the 
whispering voices of the others just outside. 
then the hobbit slipped on his ring, and warned by the echoes to take more than

as the bravest thing he ever 
did. the tremendous things that happened afterward were as nothing compared to it. he 
fought the real battle in the tunnel alone, before he ever saw the vast danger that lay in 
wait. at any rate after a short halt go on he did; and you can picture him coming to the 
end of the tunnel, an opening of much the same size and shape as the door above. 
through it peeps the hobbit's little head. before him lies the great bottommost cellar or 
dungeon-hall of the ancient dwarves right at the mountain's root. it is almost dark so that 
its vastaess can only be dimly guessed, but rising from the near side of the rocky floor 
there is a great glow. the glow of smaug! 
there he lay, a vast red-golden dragon, fast asleep; thrumming came from his jaws and 
nostrils, and wisps of smoke, but his fires were low in slumber. 
beneath him, under all his limbs and his huge coiled tail, and about him on all sides 
stretching away across the unseen floors, lay countless piles of prec

ssels filled 
with a wealth that could not be guessed. to say that bilbo's breath was taken away is no 
description at all. there are no words left to express his staggerment, since men 
changed the language that they learned of elves in the days when all the world was 
wonderful. bilbo had heard tell and sing of dragon-hoards before, but the splendour, the 
lust, the glory of such treasure had never yet come home to him. his heart was filled and 
pierced with enchantment and with the desire of dwarves; and he gazed motionless, 
almost forgetting the frightful guardian, at the gold beyond price and count. 
he gazed for what seemed an age, before drawn almost against his will, he stole from 
the shadow of the doorway, across the floor to the nearest edge of the mounds of 
treasure. above him the sleeping dragon lay, a dire menace even in his sleep. he 
grasped a great two-handled cup, as heavy as he could carry, and cast one fearful eye 
upwards. smaug stirred a wing, opened a claw, the rumble

he cup, and his chief thought was: "i've 
done it! this will show them. 'more like a grocer than a burglar' indeed! well, we'll hear 
no more of that." 
nor did he. balin was overjoyed to see the hobbit again, and as delighted as he was 
surprised. he picked bilbo up and carried him out into the open air. 
it was midnight and clouds had covered the stars, but bilbo lay with his eyes shut, 
gasping and taking pleasure in the feel of the fresh air again, and hardly noticing the 
excitement of the dwarves, or how they praised him and patted him on the back and put 
themselves and all their families for generations to come at his service. 
the dwarves were still passing the cup from hand to hand and talking delightedly of the 
recovery of their treasure, when suddenly a vast rumbling woke in the mountain 
underneath as if it was an old volcano that had made up its mind to start eruptions once 
again. the door behind them was pulled nearly to, and blocked from closing with a 
stone, but up the lon

g tunnel came the dreadful echoes, from far down in the depths, of 
a bellowing and a trampling that made the ground beneath them tremble. 
then the dwarves forgot their joy and their confident boasts of a moment before and 
cowered down in fright. smaug was still to be reckoned with. it does not do to leave a 
live dragon out of your calculations, if you live near him. dragons may not have much 
real use for all their wealth, but they know it to an ounce as a rule, especially after long 
possession; and smaug was no exception. he had passed from an uneasy dream (in 
which a warrior, altogether insignificant in size but provided with a bitter sword

, and then coiling his length 
together, roaring like thunder underground, he sped from his deep lair through its great 
door, out into the huge passages of the mountain-palace and up towards the front gate. 
to hunt the whole mountain till he had caught the thief and had torn and trampled him 
was his one thought. he issued from the gate, the waters rose in fierce whistling steam, 
and up he soared blazing into the air and settled on the mountain-top in a spout of green 
and scarlet flame. the dwarves heard the awful rumour of his flight, and they crouched 
against the walls of the grassy terrace cringing under boulders, hoping somehow to 
escape the frightful eyes of the hunting dragon. 
there they would have all been killed, if it had not been for bilbo once again. "quick! 
quick!" he gasped. "the door! the tunnel! it's no good here." 
roused by these words they were just about to creep inside the tunnel when bifur gave 
a cry: "my cousins! bombur and bofur - we have forgotten them, they a

d been standing; but the door withstood his searching eye, 
and the little high-walled bay had kept out his fiercest flames. long he had hunted in 
vain till the dawn chilled his wrath and he went back to his golden couch to sleep - and to 
gather new strength. 

he would not forget or forgive the theft, not if a thousand years turned him to 
smouldering stone, but he could afford to wait. slow and silent he crept back to his lair 
and half closed his eyes. 
when morning came the terror of the dwarves grew less. they realized that dangers of 
this kind were inevitable in dealing with such a guardian, and that it was no good giving 
up their quest yet. nor could they get away just now, as thorin had pointed out. their 
ponies were lost or killed, and they would have to wait some time before smaug relaxed 
his watch sufficiently for them to dare the long way on foot. luckily they had saved 
enough of their stores to last them still for some time. 
they debated long on what was to be done, but

is any grumbling to be done, i think i might have a say. you ought to have brought five 
hundred burglars not one. i am sure it reflects great credit on your grandfather, but you 
cannot pretend that you ever made the vast extent of his wealth clear to me. i should 
want hundreds of years to bring it all up, if i was fifty times as big, and smaug as tame 
as a rabbit." 
after that of course the dwarves begged his pardon. 
"what then do you propose we should do, mr. baggins?" asked thorin politely. 
"i have no idea at the moment - if you mean about removing the treasure. 
that obviously depends entirely on some new turn of luck and the getting rid of smaug. 
getting rid of dragons is not at all in my line, but i will do my best to think about it. 
personally i have no hopes at all, and wish i was safe back at home." 
"never mind that for the moment! what are we to do now, to-day?" 
"well, if y

long one or two could be chosen to go back to the store by the river and replenish our 
supplies. but in the meanwhile everyone ought to be well inside the tunnel by night. 
"now i will make you an offer. i have got my ring and will creep down this very noon-then 
if ever smaug ought to be napping-and see what he is up to. perhaps something will 
turn up. 'every worm has his weak spot,' as my father used to say, though i am sure it 
was not from personal experience." 
naturally the dwarves accepted the offer eagerly. already they had come to respect little 
bilbo. now he had become the real leader in their adventure. 
he had begun to have ideas and plans of his own. when midday came he got ready for 
another journey down into the mountain. he did not like it of course, but it was not so 
bad now he knew, more or less, what was in front of him. had he known more about 
dragons and their wily ways, he might have teen more frightened and less hopeful of 
catching this one napping.

"very well, o barrel-rider!" he said aloud. "maybe barrel was your pony's name; and 
maybe not, though it was fat enough. you may walk unseen, but you did not walk all the 
way. let me tell you i ate six ponies last night and i shall catch and eat all the others 
before long. in return for the excellent meal i will give you one piece of advice for your 
good: don't have more to do with dwarves than you can help!" 
"dwarves!" said bilbo in pretended surprise. 
"don't talk to me!" said smaug. "i know the smell (and taste) of dwarf-no one better. 
don't tell me that i can eat a dwarf-ridden pony and not know it! 
you'll come to a bad end, if you go with such friends. thief barrel-rider. i don't mind if 
you go back and tell them so from me." 

but he did not tell bilbo that there was one smell he could not make out at all, hobbit-
smell; it was quite outside his experience and puzzled

so far all his. thoughts and energies had been concentrated on getting to the mountain 
and finding the entrance. he had never bothered to wonder how the treasure was to be 
removed, certainly never how any part of it that might fall to his share was to be brought 
back all the way to bag-end under-hill. 
now a nasty suspicion began to grow in his mind-had the dwarves forgotten this 
important point too, or were they laughing in their sleeves at him all the time? that is the 
effect that dragon-talk has on the inexperienced. bilbo of course ought to have been on 
his guard; but smaug had rather an overwhelming personality. 
"i tell you," he said, in an effort to remain loyal to his friends and to keep his end up, "that 
gold was only an afterthought with us. we came over hill and under hill, by wave and 
win, for "revenge". surely, o smaug the unassessably w

ealthy, you must realize that 
your success has made you some bitter enemies?" 
then smaug really did laugh-a devastating sound which shook bilbo to the floor, while 
far up in the tunnel the dwarves huddled together and imagined that the hobbit had 
come to a sudden and a nasty end. 
"revenge!" he snorted, and the light of his eyes lit the the hall from floor to ceiling like 
scarlet lightning. "revenge! the king under the mountain is dead and where are hi kin 
that dare seek revenge? girion lord of dale is dead, and i have eaten his people like a 
wolf among sheep, and where are his sons' sons that dare approach me? i kill where i

e had been feeling rather pleased with the cleverness of his conversation with 
smaug, but his mistake at the end shook him into better sense. 
"never laugh at live dragons, bilbo you fool!" he said to himself, and it became a 
favourite saying of his later, and passed into a proverb. "you aren't nearly through this 
adventure yet," he added, and that was pretty true as well. 
the afternoon was turning into evening when he came out again and stumbled and fell 
in a faint on the 'door-step.' the dwarves revived him, and doctored his scorches as well 
as they could; but it was a long time before the hair on the back of his head and his 
heels grew properly again: it had all been singed and frizzled right down to the skin. in 
the meanwhile his friends did their best to cheer him up; and they were eager for his 
story, especially wanting to know why the dragon had made such an awful noise, and 
how bilbo had escaped. 
but the hobbit was worried and uncomfortable, and they had difficulty in getti

ved and magical race, and this might even be one of those that were 
alive then, a couple of hundreds years or more ago. the men of dale used to have the 

trick of understanding their language, and used them for messengers to fly to the men of 
the lake and elsewhere." 
"well, he'll have news to take to lake-town all right, if that is what he is after," said bilbo; 
"though i don't suppose there are any people left there that trouble with thrush-
language." 
"why what has happened?" cried the dwarves. "do get on with your tale!" 
so bilbo told them all he could remember, and he confessed that he had a nasty feeling 
that the dragon guessed too much from his riddles added to the camps and the ponies. 
"i am sure he knows we came from lake-town and had help from there; and i have a 
horrible feeling that his next move may be in that direction. i wish to goodness i had 
never said that about barrel-rider; it would make even a blind rabbit in these parts think 
of the lake-men." 
"well, well! i

 then, if he is so eager to keep us out? he has not, or we should have heard him." 
"i don't know, i don't know-because at first he wanted to try and lure me in again, i 
suppose, and now perhaps because he is waiting till after tonight's hunt, or because he 
does not want to damage his bedroom if he can help it - but i wish you would not argue. 
smaug will be coming out at any minute now, and our only hope is to get well in the 
tunnel and shut the door." 
he seemed so much in earnest that the dwarves at last did as he said, though they 
delayed shutting the door-it seemed a desperate plan, for no one knew whether or how 
they could get it open again from the inside, and the thought of being shut in a place 
from which the only way out led through the dragon's lair was not one they liked. also 
everything seemed quite quiet, both outside and down the tunnel. so for a longish while 
they sat inside not far down from the half-open door and went on talking. the talk turned 
to the dragon's wick

ed words about the dwarves. bilbo wished he had never heard them, 
or at least that he could feel quite certain that the dwarves now were absolutely honest 
when they declared that they had never thought at all about what would happen after the 
treasure had been won. 

"we knew it would be a desperate venture," said thorin, "and we know that still; and i 
still think that when we have won it will be time enough to think what to do about it. as 
for your share, mr. baggins, i assure you we are more than grateful and you shall

 of thror, two-handed, hammered and carven with birds and flowers whose eyes and 
petals were of jewels; coats of mail gilded and silvered and impenetrable; the necklace 
of girion, lord of dale, made of five hundred emeralds green as grass, which he gave 
for the arming of his eldest son in a coat of dwarflinked rings the like of which had never 
been made before, for it was wrought of pure silver to the power and strength of triple 
steel. but fairest of all was the great white gem, which the dwarves had found beneath 
the roots of the mountain, the heart of the mountain, the arkenstone of thrain. 
"the arkenstone! the arkenstone!" murmured thorin in the dark, half dreaming with his 
chin upon his knees. "it was like a globe with a thousand facets; it shone like silver in the 
firelight, like water in the sun, like snow under the stars, like rain upon the moon!" 
but the enchanted desire of the hoard had fallen from bilbo. all through their talk he was 
only half listening to them. he sat n

darkness grew deeper and he grew ever more uneasy. "shut the door!" he begged 
them. "i fear that dragon in my marrow. i like this silence far less than the uproar of last 
night. shut the door before it is too late!" 
something in his voice gave the dwarves an uncomfortable feeling. slowly thorin shook 
off his dreams and getting up he kicked away the stone that wedged the door. then they 
thrust upon it, and it closed with a snap and a clang. no trace of a keyhole was there left 
on the inside. they were shut in the mountain! 
and not a moment too soon. they had hardly gone any distance down the tunnel when a 
blow smote the side of the mountain like the crash of batteringrams made of forest oaks 
and swung by giants. the rock boomed, the walls c

would not be troubled again from that direction. in-the meanwhile he had further 
vengeance to take. "barrel-rider!" he snorted. "your fee came from the waterside and up 
the water you came with out a doubt. i don't know your smell, but if you are not one of 
those men of the lake, you had their help. they shall see me and remember who is the 
real king under the mountain!" 
he rose in fire and went away south towards the running river.

not at home 
 
in the meanwhile, the dwarves sat in darkness, and utter silence fell about them. little 
they ate and little they spoke. they could not count the passing of time; and they 
scarcely dared to move, for the whisper of their voices echoed and rustled in the tunnel. 
if they dozed, they woke still to darkness and to silence going on unbroken. at last after 
days and days of waiting, as it seemed, when they were becoming choked and dazed for 
want of air, they could bear it no longer. they would almost have welcomed sounds from

below of the dragon's return. in the silence they feared some cunning devilry of his, but 
they could not sit there for ever. 
thorin spoke: "let us try the door!" he said. "i must feel the wind on my face soon or die. 
i think i would rather be smashed by smaug in the open than suffocate in here!" 
so several of the dwarves got up and groped back to where the door had been. but they 
found that the upper end of the tunnel had been shattered and blocked with broken rock. 
neither key nor the magic it had once obeyed would ever open that door again. 
"we are trapped!" they groaned. "this is the end. we shall die here." 
but somehow, just when the dwarves were most despairing, bilbo felt a strange 
lightening of the heart, as if a heavy weight had gone from under his waistcoat. 
"come, come!" he said. "while there's

twice, when i knew there was a dragon at the other end, so i will risk a third visit when i 
am no longer sure. anyway the only way out is down. and i think time you had better all 
come with me." 
in desperation they agreed, and thorin was the first go forward by bilbo's side. 
"now do be careful!" whispered the hobbit, "and quiet as you can be! 
there may be no smaug at the bottom but then again there may be. don't let us take 
any unnecessary risks!" 
down, down they went. the dwarves could not, course, compare with the hobbit in real 
stealth, and the made a deal of puffing and shuffling which echoes magnified alarmingly; 
but though every now and again bilbo in fear stopped and listened, not a sound stirred 
below near the bottom, as well as he could judge, bilbo slipped on his ring and went 
ahead. but he did not need it: the darkness was complete, and they were all invisible, 
ring or no ring. in fact so black was it that the hobbit came to the opening unexpectedly, 
put

faint echoes ran round the unseen hall, but there was no answer. bilbo got up, and 
found that he did not know in what direction to turn. 
"now i wonder what on earth smaug is playing at," he said. "he is not at home today (or 
tonight, or whatever it is), i do believe. if oin and gloin have not lost their time tinder-
boxes, perhaps we can make a little light, and have a look round before the luck turns." 
"light!" he cried. "can anybody make a light?" 
the dwarves, of course, were very alarmed when bilbo fell forward down the step with a 
bump into the hall, and they sat huddled just where he had left them at the end the 
tunnel. 
"sh! sh!" they hissed, when they heard his voice: and though that helped the hobbit to 
find out where they were, was some time before he could get anything else out of them. 
but in the end, when bilbo actually began to stamp in the floor, and screamed out light!' 
at the top of his thrill voice, thorin gave way, and oin and g

loin were sent back to their 
bundles at the top of the tunnel. after a while a twinkling gleam showed them returning, 
in with a small pine-torch alight in his hand, and gloin with a bundle of others under his 
arm. quickly bilbo trotted to the door and took the torch; but he could not persuade the 
dwarves to light the others or to come and join him yet. as thorin carefully explained, 
mr. baggins was still officially their expert burglar and investigator. if he liked to risk a 
light, that was his affair. 
they would wait in the tunnel for his report. so they sat near the door and watched. 
they saw the little dark shape of the hobbit start across the floor holding his tiny light 
aloft. every now and again, while he was still near enough, they caught a glint and a 
tinkle as he stumbled on some

en in so marvellous a hoard, even in all the world. ever as he climbed, the 
same white gleam had shone before him and drawn his feet towards slowly it grew to a 
little globe of pallid light. now as came near, it was tinged with a flickering sparkle of 
man colours at the surface, reflected and splintered from the wavering light of his torch. 
at last he looked down upon it and he caught his breath. the great jewel shone before 
he feet of its own inner light, and yet, cut and fashioned by the dwarves, who had dug it 
from the heart of the mountain long ago, it took all light that fell upon it and-changes it 
into ten thousand sparks of white radiance shot with glints of the rainbow. 
suddenly bilbo's arm went towards it drawn by it enchantment. his small hand would not 
close about it for it was a large and heavy gem; but he lifted it, shut his eyes, and put it in 
his deepest pocket. 
"now i am a burglar indeed!" thought he. "but i suppose i must tell the dwarves about it-
some time. the d

id say i could pick and choose my own share; and i think i would 
choose this, if they took all the rest!" all the same he had an uncomfortable feeling that 
the picking and choosing had not really been meant to include this marvellous gem, and 
that trouble would yet come of it. 
now he went on again. down the other side of the great mound he climbed, and the 
spark of his torch vanished from the sight of the watching dwarves. but soon they saw it 
far away in the distance again. bilbo was crossing the floor of the hall. 
he went on, until he came to the great doors at the further side, and there a draught of 
air refreshed him, but it almost puffed out his light. he peeped timidly through and 
caught a glimpse of great passages and of the dim beginnings of wide stairs going up 
into the gloom. and still there was no sight nor sound of smaug. he was just going to

m and brushed his face. he 
squeaked and started, stumbled backwards and fell. his torch dropped head downwards 
and went out! 
"only a bat, i suppose and hope!" he said miserably. but now what am i to do? which is 
east, south, north west?" 
"thorin! balin! oin! gloin! fill! kili!" he cried as loud he could-it seemed a thin little noise 
in the wide blackness. "the light's gone out! 
someone come and find and help me!" for the moment his courage had failed together. 
faintly the dwarves heard his small cries, though the only word they could catch was 
'help!' 
"now what on earth or under it has happened?" said thorin. "certainly not the dragon, or 
he would not go on squeaking." 
they waited a moment or two, and still there were no dragon-noises, no sound at all in 
fact but bilbo's distant voice. "come, one of you, get another light or two!" thorin 
ordered. "it seems we have got to go and help our burglar." 
"it is about our turn to help," said balin, "and i am quite willing

eir questions. 
though they were much relieved, they were inclined to be grumpy at being frightened for 
nothing; but what they would have said, if he had told them at that moment about the 
arkenstone, i don't know. the mere fleeting glimpses of treasure which they had caught 
as they went along had rekindled all the fire of their dwarvish hearts; and when the heart 
of a dwarf, even the most respectable, is wakened by gold and by jewels, he grows 
suddenly bold, and he may become fierce. 
the dwarves indeed no longer needed any urging. all were now eager to explore the hall 
while they had the chance, and willing to believe that, for the present, smaug was away 
from home. each now gripped a lighted torch; and as they gazed, first on one side and 
then on another, they forgot fear and even caution. they spoke aloud, and cried out to 
one another, as they lifted old treasures from the mound or from the wall and held them 
in the light caressing and fingering them. fili and kili were almost i

n merry mood, and 
finding still hanging there many golden harps strung with silver they took them and 
struck them; and being magical (and also untouched by the dragon, who had small 
interests in music) they were still in tune. the dark hall was filled with a melody that had 
long been silent. but most of the dwarves were more practical; they gathered gems and 
stuffed their pockets, and let what they could not carry far back through their fingers with 
a sigh. thorin was not least among these; but always he searched from side to side for 
something which he could not find. it was the arkenstone but he spoke of it yet to no 
one. 
now the dwarves took down mail and weapons from the walls, and armed themselves. 
royal indeed did thorin look, clad in a coat of gold-plated rings, with a silver hafted axe

silver-steel which the elves call mithril, and with it went a belt of pearls and 
crystals. a light helm of figured leather, strengthened beneath with hoops of steel, and 
studded about the bring with white gems, was set upon the hobbit's head. 

"i feel magnificent," he thought; "but i expect i look rather absurd. how they would laugh 
on the hill at home still i wish there was a looking-glass handy!" 
all the same mr. baggins kept his head more clear of the bewitchment of the hoard than 
the dwarves did. long before the dwarves were tired of examining the treasures he 
became wary of it and sat down on the floor; and he began to wonder nervously what 
the end of it all would be "i would give a good many of these precious goblets, thought, 
"for a drink of something cheering out of one beorn's wooden bowls!" 
"thorin!" he cried aloud. "what next? we are armed, but what good has any armour ever 
been before against smaug the dreadful? this treasure is not yet won back. we are not

 halted often, listening in fear once more for any rumour of the 
dragon's coming. though all the old adornments were long mouldered or destroyed, and 
though all was befouled and blasted with the comings and goings of the monster, thorin 
knew every passage and every turn. they climbed long stairs, and turned and went 
down wide echoing ways, and turned again and climbed yet more stairs, and yet more' 
stairs again. 
these were smooth, cut out of the living rock broad and lair; and up, up, the dwarves 
went, and they met no sign of any living thing, only furtive shadows that fled from the 
approach of their torches fluttering in the draughts. the steps were not made, all the 
same, for hobbit-legs, and bilbo was just feeling that he could go on no longer, when 
suddenly the roof sprang high and far beyond the reach of their torch-light. a white 
glimmer could be seen coming through some opening far above, and the air smelt 
sweeter. before them light came dimly through great doors, that hung

and it might have been one night or a week of nights for all he could tell. 
"come, come!" said thorin laughing - his spirits had begun to rise again, and he rattled 
the precious stones in his pockets. "don't call my place a nasty hole! you wait till it has 
been cleaned and redecorated!" 
"that won't be till smaug's dead," said bilbo glumly. "in the meanwhile where is he? i 
would give a good breakfast to know. i hope he is not up on the mountain looking down 
at us!" 
that idea disturbed the dwarves mightily, and they quickly decided that bilbo and balin 
were right. 
"we must move away from here," said don. "i feel as if his eyes were on the back of my 
head." 
"it's a cold lonesome place," said bombur. "there may be drink, but i see no sign of 
food. a dragon would always be hungry in such parts." 
"come on! come on!" cried the others. "let us follow balm's path!" 
under the rocky wall to the right there was no path, so on they trudged among the 
stones on the left side of the river, and

at once and slept, but the others sat 
near the outer door and discussed their plans. 
in all their talk they came perpetually back to one thing: where was smaug? they looked 
west and there was nothing, and east there was nothing, and in the south there was no 
sign of the dragon, but there was a gathering of very many birds. at that they gazed and 
wondered; but they were no nearer understanding it, when the first cold stars came out.

now if you wish, like the dwarves, to hear news of smaug, you must go back again to 
the evening when he smashed the door and flew off in rage, two days before. 
the men of the lake-town esgaroth were mostly indoors, for the breeze was from the 
black east and chill, but a few were walking on the quays, and watching, as they were 
fond of doing, the stars shine out from the smooth patches of the lake as they opened in 
the sky. from their town the lonely mountain was mostly screened by the low hills at the 
far end of the lake,

another swoop and another, and another house and then another sprang afire and fell; 
and still no arrow hindered smaug or hurt him more than a fly from the marshes. already 
men were jumping into the water on every side. women and children were being 
huddled into laden boats in the market-pool. weapons were flung down. there was 
mourning and weeping, where but a little time ago the old songs of mirth to come had 
been sung about the dwarves. now men cursed their names. the master himself was 
turning to his great gilded boat, hoping to row away in the confusion and save himself. 

soon all the town would be deserted and burned down to the surface of the lake. that 
was the dragon's hope. they could all get into boats for all he cared. there he could 
have fine sport hunting them, or they could stop till they starved. let them try to get to 
land and he would be ready. soon he would set all the shoreland woods ablaze and 
wither e

from whom should we claim the recompense of our damage, and aid for our widows 
and orphans?" 
as you see, the master had not got his position for nothing. the result of his words was 
that for the moment the people quite forgot their idea of a new king, and turned their 
angry thoughts towards thorin and his company. wild and bitter words were shouted 
from many sides; and some of those who had before sung the old songs loudest, were 
now heard as loudly crying that the dwarves had stirred the dragon up against them 
deliberately! 
"fools!" said bard. "why waste words and wrath on those unhappy creatures? 
doubtless they perished first in fire, before smaug came to us." 
then even as he was speaking, the thought came into his heart of the fabled treasure of 
the mountain lying without guard or owner, and he fell suddenly silent. he thought of the 
master's words, and of dale rebuilt, and filled with golden bells, if he could but find the 
men. 
at length he spoke agai

stones that fell from his rotting carcass. 

but all the men of arms who were still able, and the most of the elvenking's array, got 
ready to march north to the mountain. it was thus that in eleven days from the ruin of the 
town the head of their host passed the rock-gates at the end of the lake and came into 
the desolate lands.

the gathering of the clouds 
 
now we will return to bilbo and the dwarves. all night one of them had watched, but 
when morning came they had not heard or seen any sign of danger. 
but ever more thickly the birds were gathering. their companies came flying from the 
south; and the crows that still lived about the mountain were wheeling and crying 
unceasingly above. 
"something strange is happening," said thorin. "the time has gone for the autumn 
wanderings; and these are birds that dwell always in the land; there are starlings and 
flocks of finches; and far off th

tidings in the south - some are tidings of joy to you, and some you will not think so good. 
"behold! the birds are gathering back again to the mountain and to dale from south and 
east and west, for word has gone out that smaug is dead!" 
"dead! dead?" shouted the dwarves. "dead! then we have been in needless fear-and 
the treasure is ours!" 
they all sprang up and began to caper about for joy. 
"yes, dead," said rac. "the thrush, may his feathers never fall, saw him die, and we 
may trust his words. he saw him fall in battle with the men of esgaroth the third night 
back from now at the rising of the moon." 
it was some time before thorin could bring the dwarves to be silent and listen to the 
raven's news. at length when he had told all the tale of the battle

d. you may go back to your halls in safety; all the 
treasure is yours-for the moment. but many are gathering hither beside the birds. the 
news of the death of the guardian has already gone far and wide, and the legend of the 
wealth of thror has not lost in the telling during many years; many are eager for a share 
of the spoil. already a host of the elves is on the way, and carrion birds are with them 
hoping for battle and slaughter. by the lake men murmur that their sorrows are due to 
the dwarves; for they are homeless and many have died, and smaug has destroyed 
their town. they too think to find amends from your treasure, whether you are alive or 
dead. 
"your own wisdom must decide your course, but thirteen is small remnant of the great 
folk of durin that once dwelt here, and now are scattered far. if you will listen to my 
counsel, you will not trust the master of the lake-men, but rather him that shot the

d or bad," croaked rac; "but i will do what can be 
done." then off he slowly flew. 
"back now to the mountain!" cried thorin. "we have little time to lose." 
"and little food to use!" cried bilbo, always practical on such points. 
in any case he felt that the adventure was, properly speaking, over .with the death of the 
dragon-in which he was much mistaken-and he would have given most of his share of 
the profits for the peaceful winding up of these affairs. 
"back to the mountain!" cried the dwarves as if they had not heard him; so back he had 
to go with them. as you have heard some of the events already, you will see that the 
dwarves still had some days before them. they explored the caverns once more, and 
found, as they expected, that only the front gate remained open; all the other gates 
(except, of course, the small secret door) had long ago been broken and blocked by 
smaug, and no sign of them remained. 

so now they began to labour hard in fortifying the main entrance, and in r

road that led from it. tools were to be found in plenty that the miners and quarriers and 
builders of old had used; and at such work the dwarves were still very skilled. 
as they worked the ravens brought them constant tidings. in this way they learned that 
the elvenking had turned aside to the lake, and they still had a breathing space. better 
still, they heard that three of their ponies had escaped and were wandering wild far down 
the banks of the running river, not far from where the rest of their stores had been left. 
so while the others went on with their work, fili and kili were sent, guided by a raven, to 
find the ponies and

utwards from the wall. the ponies they had brought only to the head of the 
steps above the old bridge, and unloading them there had bidden them return to their 
masters and sent them back riderless to the south. 
there came a night when suddenly there were many lights as of fires and torches away 
south in dale before them. 
"they have come!" called balin. "and their camp is very great. they must have come 
into the valley under the cover of dusk along both banks of the river." 
that night the dwarves slept little. the morning was still pale when they saw a company 
approaching. from behind their wall they watched them come up to the valley's head 
and climb slowly up. before long they could see that both men of the lake armed as if for 
war and elvish bowmen were among them. at length the foremost of these climbed the 
tumbled rocks and appeared at the top of the falls; and very great was their surprise to 
see the pool before them and the gate blocked with a wall of new-hewn stone.

as brought right between the arms of the mountain. the rocks echoed then with 
voices and with song, as they had not done for many a day. there was the sound, too, 
of elven-harps and of sweet music; and as it echoed up towards them it seemed that the 
chill of the air was warmed, and they caught faintly the fragrance of woodland flowers 
blossoming in spring. 
then bilbo longed to escape from the dark fortress and to go down and join in the mirth 
and feasting by the fires. some of the younger dwarves were moved in their hearts, too, 
and they muttered that they wished things had fallen out otherwise and that they might 
welcome such folk as friends; but thorin scowled. 
then the dwarves themselves brought forth harps and instruments regained from the 
hoard, and made music to soften his mood; but their song was not as elvish song, and 
was much like the song they had sung long before in bilbo's little hobbit-hole.

then thorin seized a bow of horn and shot an arrow at the speaker. it smote into his 
shield and stuck there quivering. 
'"since such is your answer," he called in return, "i declare the mountain besieged. you 
shall not depart from it, until you call on your side for a truce and a parley. we will bear

with that the messengers departed swiftly, and the dwarves were left to consider their 
case. so grim had thorin become, that even if they had wished, the others would not 
have dared to find fault with him; but indeed most of them seemed to share his mind-
except perhaps old fat bombur and fili and kili. 

bilbo, of course, disapproved of the whole turn of affairs. he had by now had more than 
enough of the mountain, and being besieged inside it was not at all to his taste. 
"the whole place still stinks of dragon," he grumbled to himself, "and it ma

now the days passed slowly and wearily. many of the dwarves spent their time piling 
and ordering the treasure; and now thorin spoke of the arkenstone of thrain, and bade 
them eagerly to look for it in every comer. 
"for the arkenstone of my father," he said, "is worth more than a river of gold in itself, 
and to me it is beyond price. that stone of all the treasure i name unto myself, and i will 
be avenged on anyone who finds it and withholds it." 
bilbo heard these words and he grew afraid, wondering what would happen, if the stone 
was found-wrappe

the same he did not speak of it, for as the weariness of the days grew heavier, the 
beginnings of a plan had come into his little head. 
things had gone on like this for some time, when the ravens brought newsthat dain and 
more than five hundred dwarves, hurrying from the iron hills, were now within about two 
days' march of dale, coming from the north-east. 
"but they cannot reach the mountain unmarked," said rac, "and i fear lest there be 
battle in the valley. i do not call this counsel good. though they are a grim folk, they are 
not likely to overcome the host that besets you; and even if they did so, what will you 
gain? winter and snow is hastening behind them. how shall you be fed without the 
friendship and goodwill of the lands about

hey may find their dwelling in the waste grievous to bear. with my friends behind them 
and winter upon them, they will perhaps be in softer mood to parley with." 
that night bilbo made up his mind. the sky was black and moonless. as soon as it was 
full dark, he went to a corner of an inner chamber just within the gate and drew from his 
bundle a rope, and also the arkenstone wrapped in a rag. then he climbed to the top of 
the wall. only bombur was there, for it was his turn to watch, and the dwarves kept only 
one watchman at a time. 
"it is mighty cold!" said bombur. "i wish we could have a fire up here as they have in the 
camp!" 
"it is warm enough inside," said bilbo. 
"i daresay; but i am bound here till midnight," grumbled the fat dwarf. 
"a sorry business altogether. not that i venture to disagree with thorin, may his beard 
grow ever longer; yet he was ever a dwarf with a stiff neck." 
"not as stiff as my legs," said bilbo. "i am tired of stairs and stone passages. i would 
give a

they will help him more than us, if it is that queer little creature that is said to be their 
servant." 
"servant, indeed!" snorted bilbo; and in the middle of his snort he sneezed loudly, and 
the elves immediately gathered towards the sound. 
"let's have a light!" he said. "i am here, if you want me!" and he slipped off his ring, and 
popped from behind a rock. 
they seized him quickly, in spite of their surprise. "who are you? are you the dwarves' 
hobbit? what are you doing? how did you get so far past our sentinels?" they asked one 
after another. 
"i am mr. bilbo baggins," he answered, "companion of thorin, if you want to know. i 
know your king well by sight, though perhaps he doesn't know me to look at. but bard 
will remember me, and it is bard i particularly want to see." 
"indeed!" said they, "and what may be your business?" 
"whatever it is, it's my own, my good elves. but if you wish ever to get back to your own 
woods from th

and starve, as long as you sit here." 
"well, let him!" said bard. "such a fool deserves to starve." 
"quite so," said bilbo. "i see your point of view. at the same time winter is coming on 
fast. before long you will be having snow and what not, and supplies will be difficult - 

even for elves i imagine. also there will be other difficulties. you have not heard of dain 
and the dwarves of the iron hills?" 
"we have, a long time ago; but what has he got to do with us?" asked the king. 
"i thought as much. i see i have some information you have not got. dain, i may tell you, 
is now less than two days' march off, and has at least five hundred grim dwarves with 
him - a good many of them have had experience in the dreadful dwarf and goblin wars, 
of which you have no doubt heard. when they arrive there may be serious trouble." 
"why do you tell us this? are you betraying your fr

handed the marvelous stone to bard, and he held it in his hand, as though dazed. 
"but how is it yours to give?" he asked at last with an effort. 
"o well!" said the hobbit uncomfortably. "it isn't exactly; but, well, i am willing to let it 
stand against all my claim, don't you know. i may be a burglar-or so they say: personally 
i never really felt like one-but i am an honest one, i hope, more or less. anyway i am 
going back now, and the dwarves can do what they like to me. i hope you will find it 
useful." 
the elvenking looked at bilbo with a new wonder. 
"bilbo baggins!" he said. "you are more worthy to wear the armour of elfprinces than 
many that have looked more comely in it. but i wonder if thorin oakenshield will see it 
so. i have more knowledge of dwarves in general than you have perhaps. i advise you to 
remain with us, and here you shall be honoured and thrice welcome." 
"thank you very much i am sure," said bilbo with a bo

were changed. 
"that will be dain!" said thorin when he heard. "they will have got wind of his coming. i 
thought that would alter their mood! bid them come few in number and weaponless, and 
i will hear," he called to the messenger. 
about midday the banners of the forest and the lake were seen to be borne forth again. 
a company of twenty was approaching. at the beginning of the narrow way they laid 
aside sword and spear, and came on towards the gate. 
wondering, the dwarves saw that among them were both bard and the elvenking, 
before whom an old man wrapped in cloak and hood bore a strong casket of ironbound 
wood. 
"hail thorin!" said bard. "are you still of the same mind?" 
"my mind does not change with the rising and setting of a few suns," answered thorin. 
"did you come to ask me idle questions? still the elf-host has not departed as i bade! till 
then you come in vain to bargain with me." 
"is there then nothing for which you would yield any of your gold?"

will i have dealings with any wizard or his friends. what have you to say, you 
descendant of rats?" 
"dear me! dear me!" said bilbo. "i am sure this is all very uncomfortable. you may

take it that i have disposed of my share as i wished, and let it go at that!" 
"i will," said thorin grimly. "and i will let you go at that-and may we never meet again!" 
then he turned and spoke over the wall. "i am betrayed," he said. "it was rightly guessed

ot making a very splendid figure as king under the mountain," said gandalf. 
"but things may change yet." 
"they may indeed," said thorin. and already, so strong was the bewilderment of the 
treasure upon him, he was pondering whether by the help of dain he might not recapture 
the arkenstone and withhold the share of the reward. 
and so bilbo was swung down from the wall, and departed with nothing for all his 
trouble, except the armour which thorin had given him already. more than one of the 
dwarves 'in their hearts felt shame and pity at his going. 
"farewell!" he cried to them. "we may meet again as friends." 
"be off!" called thorin. "you have mail upon you, which was made by my folk, and is too 
good for you. it cannot be pierced .by arrows; but if you do not hasten, i will sting your 
miserable feet. so be swift!" 
"not so hasty!" said bard. "we will give you until tomorrow. at noon we will return, and

tone. if 
that is done without deceit, then we will depart, and the elf-host will go back to the 
forest. in the meanwhile farewell!" 
with that they went back to the camp; but thorin sent messengers by rac telling dain of 
what had passed, and bidding him come with wary speed. 
that day passed and the night. the next day the wind shifted west, and the air was dark 
and gloomy. the morning was still early when a cry was heard in the camp. runners 
came in to report that a host of dwarves had appeared round the eastern spur of the 
mountain and was now hastening to dale. dain had come. he had hurried on through 
the night, and so had come upon them sooner than they had expected. each one of his 
folk was clad in a hauberk of steel mail that hung to his knees, and his legs were 
covered with hose of a fine and flexible metal mesh, the secret of whose making was 
possessed by dain's people.

or dwarves. in battle they wielded heavy two-handed mattocks; but each of them had 
also a short broad sword at his side and a round shield slung at his back. their beards 

were forked and plaited and thrust into their belts. their caps were of iron and they were 
shod with iron, and their faces were grim. trumpets called men and elves to arms. 
before long the dwarves could be seen coming up the valley at a great pace. they 
halted between the river and the eastern spur; but a few held on their way, and crossing 
the river drew near the camp; and there they laid down their weapons and held up their 
hands in sign of peace. bard went out to meet them, and with him went bilbo. 
"we are sent from dain son of nain," they said when questioned. "we are hastening to 
our kinsmen in the mountain, since we learn that the kingdom of old is renewed. but who 
are you th

at sit in the plain as foes before defended walls?" this, of. course, in the polite 
and rather old-fashioned language of such occasions, meant simply: "you have no 
business here. we are going on, so make way or we shall fight you!" they meant to 
push on between the mountain and the loop of the river, for the narrow land there did not 
seem to be strongly guarded. 
bard, of course, refused to allow the dwarves to go straight on to the mountain. he was 
determined to wait until the gold and silver had been brought out in exchange for the 
arkenstone: for he did not believe that this would be done, if once the fortress was 
manned with so large and warlike a company. 
they had brought with them a great store of supplies; for the dwarves can carry very 
heavy burdens, and nearly all of dain's folks, in spite of their rapid march, bore huge 
packs on their backs in addition to their weapons. they would s

and by that time yet more dwarves might come, and yet more, for thorin had many 
relatives. also they would be able to reopen and guard some other gate, so that the 
besiegers would have to encircle the whole mountain; and for that they had not sufficient 
numbers. 
these were, in fact, precisely their plans (for the raven-messengers had been busy 
between thorin and dain); but for the moment the way was barred, so after angry words 
the dwarf-messengers retired muttering in their beards. bard then sent messengers at

arrows came forth as soon as they were within shot, and they hastened back in dismay. 
in the camp all was now astir, as if for battle; for the dwarves of dain were advancing 
along the eastern bank. 
"fools!" laughed bard, "to come thus beneath the mountain's arm! they do not 
understand war above ground, whatever they may know of battle in the mines. there are 
many of our archers and spearmen now hidden in the rocks upon their right flank. dwarf-
mail may be good, but they will soon be hard put to it. let us set on them now from both 
sides, before they are fully rested!" 
but the elvenking said: "long will i tarry, ere i begin this war for

cannot press us, unless we will, or do anything that we cannot mark. let us hope still for 
something that will bring reconciliation. 
our advantage in numbers will be enough, if in the end it must come to unhappy blows." 
but he reckoned without the dwarves. the knowledge that the arkenstone was in the 
hands of the besiegers burned in their thoughts; also they guessed the hesitation of bard 
and his friends, and resolved to strike while they debated. 
suddenly without a signal they sprang silently forward to attack. bows twanged and 
arrows whistled; battle was about to be joined. 
still more suddenly a darkness came on with dreadful swiftness! a black cloud hurried 
over the sky. winter thunder on a wild wind rolled roaring up and rumbled in the

mountain, and lightning lit its peak. and beneath the thunder another blackness could be 
seen whirling forward; but it did not come with the wind, it came from the north, like a 
vast cloud of birds, so dense that no light could be seen between their wings. 

"halt!" cried gandalf, who appeared suddenly, and stood alone, with arms uplifted, 
between the advancing dwarves and the ranks awaiting them. "halt!" he called in a voice 
like thunder, and his staff blazed forth with a flash like the lightning. "dread has come 
upon you all! alas! it has come more swiftly than i guessed. the goblins are upon you! 
bolg of the north is coming. 
o dain! whose father you slew in moria. behold! the bats are above his army like a sea 
of locusts. they ride upon wolves and wargs are in their train!" 
amazement and confusion fell upon them all. even as gandalf had been speaking

darkness grew. the dwarves halted and gazed at the sky. the elves cried out with many 
voices. 
"come!" called gandalf. "there is yet time for council. let dain son of nain come swiftly 
to us!" 
so began a battle that none had expected; and it was called the battle of five armies, 
and it was very terrible. upon one side were the goblins and the wild wolves, and upon 
the other were elves and men and dwarves. this is how it fell out. ever since the fall of 
the great goblin of the misty mountains the hatred of their race for the dwarves had 
been rekindled to fury. messengers had passed to and fro between all their cities, 
colonies and strongholds; for they resolved now to win the dominion of the north. 
tidings they had gathered in secret ways; and in all the mountains there was a forging 
and an arming. 
then they marched and gathered by hill and valley, going ever by tunnel or under dark,

was no time for make any other plan, or to summon any help. 
soon the thunder passed, rolling away to the south-east; but the batcloud came, flying 
lower, over the shoulder of the mountain, and whirled above them shutting out the light 
and filling them with dread. 
"to the mountain!" called bard. "to the mountain! let us take our places while there is 
yet time!" 
on the southern spur, in its lower slopes and in the rocks at its feet, the elves were set; 
on the eastern spur were men and dwarves. but bard and some of the nimblest of men 
and elves climbed to the height of the eastern shoulder to gain a view to the north. soon 
they could see the lands before the mountain's feet black with a hurrying multitude. ere 
long the vanguard swirled round the spur's end and came rushing into dale. these were 
the swiftest wolfriders, and already their cries and howls rent the air afar. a few brave 
men were strung before them to make a feint of resistance, and many there fell before

. as soon as the host of their enemies was dense in 
the valley, they sent against it a shower of arrows, and each flickered as it fled as if with 
stinging fire. behind the arrows a thousand of their spearmen leapt down and charged. 
the yells were deafening. the rocks were stained black with goblin blood. just as the 
goblins were recovering from the onslaught and the elf-charge was halted, there rosen 
from across the valley a deep-throated roar. with cries of "moria!" and "dain, dain!" the 
dwarves of the iron hills plunged in, wielding their mattocks, upon the other side; and 
beside them came the men of the lake with long swords. 
panic came upon the goblins; and even as they turned to meet this new attack, the 
elves charged again with renewed numbers. already many of the goblins were flying 
back down the river to escape from the trap: and many of their own wolves were turning 
upon them and rending the dead and the wounded. victory seemed at hand, when a cry 
rang out on the heights

rocks were buried down from on high by the goblins above; but they held on leapt down 
to the falls' foot, and rushed forward to battle. wolf and rider fell or fled before them. 
thorin wielded his axe with mighty strokes, and nothing seemed to harm him. 
"to me! to me! elves and men! to me! o my kinsfolk!" he cried, and his voice shook 
like a horn in the valley. 
down, heedless of order, rushed all the dwarves of dain to his help. down too came 
many of the lake-men, for bard could not restrain them; and out upon the other side 
came many of the spearmen of the elves. once again the goblins were stricken in the 

valley; and they were piled in heaps till dale was dark and hideous with their corpses. 
the wargs were scattered and thorin drove right against the bodyguards of bolg. but 
he could not pierce their ranks. 
already behind him among the goblin dead lay many men and many dwarves, and many

"now i wonder what has happened?" he said to himself. "at any rate i am not yet one of 
the fallen heroes; but i suppose there is still time enough for that!" 
he sat up painfully. looking into the valley he could see no living goblins. after a while 
as his head cleared a little, he thought he could see elves moving in the rocks below. he 
rubbed his eyes. surely there was a camp still in the plain some distance off; and there 

was a coming and going about the gate? dwarves seemed to be busy removing the 
wall. but all was deadly still. there was no call and no echo of a song. sorrow seemed 
to be in the air. "victory after all, i suppose!" he said, feeling his aching head. "well, 
it seems a very gloomy business." 
suddenly he was aware of a man climbing up and coming towards him. 
"hullo there!" he called with a shaky voice. "hullo there! what news?" 
"what voice is it that speaks among the stones?" said the man halting and peering about

but even with the eagles they were still outnumbered. 
in that last hour beorn himself had appeared - no one knew how or from where. he 
came alone, and in bear's shape; and he seemed to have grown almost to giant-size in 
his wrath. the roar of his voice was like drums and guns; and he tossed wolves and 
goblins from his path like straws and feathers. he fell upon their rear, and broke like a 
clap of thunder through the ring. the dwarves were making a stand still about their lords 
upon a low rounded hill. 
then beorn stooped and lifted thorin, who had fallen pierced with spears, and bore him 
out of the fray. swiftly he returned and his wrath was redoubled, so that nothing could 
withstand him, and no weapon seemed to bite upon him. he scattered the bodyguard, 
and pulled down bolg himself and crushed him. then dismay fell on the goblins and 
they fled in all directions. but weariness left their enemies with the coming of new

they buried thorin deep beneath the mountain, and bard laid the 
arkenstone upon his breast. 
"there let it lie till the mountain falls!" he said. "may it bring good fortune to all his folk 
that dwell here after!" upon his tomb the elvenking then laid orcrist, the elvish sword 
that had been taken from thorin in captivity. it is said in songs that it gleamed ever in the 
dark if foes approached, and the fortress of the dwarves could not be taken by surprise. 
there now dain son of nain took up his abode, and he became king under the 
mountain, and in time many other dwarves gathered to his throne in the ancient halls. of 
the twelve companions of thorin, ten remained. fili and kili had fallen defending him

then the dwarves bowed low before their gate, but words stuck in their throats. "good-

when our halls are made fair once more, then the feast shall indeed be splendid!"

n the lands of the mountain. it seemed they were going very well. bard had rebuilt 
the town in dale and men had gathered to him from the lake and from south and west, 
and all the valley had become tilled again and rich, and the desolation was now filled 
with birds and blossoms in spring and fruit and feasting in autumn. and lake-town was 
refounded and was more prosperous than ever, and much wealth went up and down the 
running river; and there was friendship in those parts between elves and dwarves and 
men. 
the old master had come to a bad end. bard had given him much gold for the help of 
the lake-people, but being of the kind that easily catches such disease he fell under the 
dragon-sickness, and took most of the gold and fled with it, and died of starvation in the 
waste, deserted by his companions. 
"the new master is of wiser kind," said balin, "and very popular, for, of course, he gets 
most of the credit for the present prosperity. they are making 
songs which say that in his da
