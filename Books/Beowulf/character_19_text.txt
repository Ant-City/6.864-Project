          on the wide sea-currents at swimming contended,
       10 where to humor your pride the ocean ye tried,

{'twas mere folly that actuated you both to risk your lives on the ocean.}

          from vainest vaunting adventured your bodies
          in care of the waters? and no one was able

          beloved of his liegemen, the land of the brondings,

          we made agreement as the merest of striplings
