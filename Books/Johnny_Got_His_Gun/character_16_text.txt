proof dugouts
when a man in one of them could be hit so hard that the whole complicated business of
his ears could be blown away leaving him deaf so deaf he couldn't hear his own heart
beat? he had been hit and he had been hit bad and now he was deaf. not just a little deaf.
not just halfway deaf. he was stone deaf.
he lay there for a while with the pain ebbing and thinking this will give me
something to chew on all right all right. what about the rest of the guys? maybe they
didn't come out so lucky. there were some good boys down in that hole. how'll it seem
being deaf and shouting at people? you write things on paper. no that's wrong they write
things on paper to you. it isn't anything to kick up your heels and dance about but it might
be worse. only when you're deaf you're lonesome. you're godforsaken.
so he'd never hear again. well there were a hell of a lot of things he didn't want to
hear again. he never wanted to hear the biting little castanet sound of a machine gun or
the high whi

istles and his eyes
were full of tears and he was sick at heart. it took him a long time to go to sleep.
it all seemed so real at the time and now it wasn't real at all. that was a long time
ago. that was in shale city. that was before he came to los angeles. that was when he
was a kid in high school. it seemed so long ago. somewhere probably in colorado glen
hogan and howie were still kicking around. he had got a letter once saying bill harper
had been killed at belleau wood. bill harper was a lucky guy. bill harper had got diane
and then he had been killed.
oh christ he was all mixed up again. he didn't know where he was or what he was
doing. but he was cooling off. he wasn't burning up any more. he was just light headed
and confused and he couldn't figure things out. everything was a mess but at least he was
cool.
chapter 5
he couldn't get used to the way things were melting into each other. sometimes he was
drifting on top of white clouds frightened at his smallness in the midst of a th

hts before his eyes snapped out as quickly as if somebody had shut them off with a
switch. the pain went away too. the only feeling he had was the strong throb of blood in
his brain swelling and contracting his head. but it was peaceful. it was painless. it was
such a relief that he came out of his drowning. he could think.
he thought well kid you're deaf as a post but there isn't the pain. you've got no arms
but you don't hurt. you'll never burn your hand or cut your finger or smash a nail you
lucky stiff. you're alive and you don't hurt and that's much better than being alive and
hurting. there are lots of things a deaf guy without arms can do if he doesn't hurt so
much he goes crazy from pain. he can get hooks or something for arms and he can learn
to read lips and while that doesn't exactly put him on top of the world still he's not
drowned in the bottom of a river with pain tearing his brain to pieces. he's still got air
and he's not struggling and he's got willow trees and he can thin

 while hundreds maybe thousands were left crazy or blind or crippled
and couldn't die no matter how hard they tried.
but there weren't many like him. there weren't many guys the doctors could point to
and say here is the last word here is our triumph here is the greatest thing we ever did and
we did plenty. here is a man without legs or arms or ears or eyes or nose or mouth who
breathes and eats and is just as alive as you or me. the war had been a wonderful thing
for the doctors and he was the lucky guy who had profited by everything they learned.
but there was one thing they couldn't do. they might be perfectly able to put a guy back
into the womb but they couldn't get him out again. he was there for good. all the parts
that were gone from him were gone forever. that was the thing he must remember. that
was the thing he must try to believe. when that sank in he could calm down and think.
it was like reading hi the paper that someone has won a lottery and saying to yourself
there's a guy w

e remembered the time he visited jim tift at the military hospital in lille. jim had
been put in a ward where there were a lot of guys who had holes here and there that
wouldn't heal. some of them had been lying there draining and stinking for months. the
smell of that ward when you hit it was like the smell of a corpse you stumble over on
patrol duty like the smell of a rich ripe corpse that falls open at the touch of a boot and
sends up a stench of dead flesh like a cloud of gas.
maybe he was lucky his nose was shot off. it would be pretty bad to have to lie and
smell the perfume of your own body as it rotted away. maybe he was a lucky guy after all
because with a smell like that constantly in your nose you wouldn't have much of an
appetite. but then that wouldn't bother him anyhow. he ate regular. he could feel them
sliding stuff into his belly and he knew he was eating all right. flavor didn't matter to
him.
things were getting dimmer and dimmer now. he knew he wasn't fainting again. he

chapter 12
new year's eve. snow flying in the air wet snow clouds sifting close over shale city.
everything still with lights glowing inside warm houses. no confetti no champagne bottles
no yelling no noise at all. the quietude of new year for ordinary people who worked
and were kind and wanted only peace. happy new year. his father kissing his mother and
saying happy new year my dear we've been lucky the kids are healthy i love you happy
new year i hope the new one turns out as well as the old.
new year's eve at the bakery with guys saying goddam i'm glad it's over the next one
can't be any worse happy new year hell let's go out into the fog and get drunk. walking
out of the bakery on new year's eve with the bins every which-way and the ovens empty
and the conveyors stopped and the wrapping machines paralyzed and the dividers still
and nobody but the crew going out of a strange silent place

ss pretty well.
about the middle of the service a couple flares went up from the other side and just
as the corporal was throwing the third handful of dirt into lazarus' face somebody got a
bead on him and shot him right smack through the bottom. corporal timlon hollered out
god 'ave mercy on your soul amen those bloody barstards 'ave shot me in the arse that's
wot they've done mike for cover men. and they all scrambled back to the lines.
corporal timlon got eight weeks hospital leave which was lucky for him because the
whole limey regiment was almost wiped out three weeks later. a couple days after
corporal timlon was shot lazarus stopped another one and hit the fence again with his
sheets flapping in the wind and parts of him dripping toward the ground. one of the
limeys said that was to be expected because bavarians never held up very well after the
first week. the whole regiment opened fire on poor lazarus and managed to shoot him
off the wire. you could still smell him but you couldn't

there was a girl named lucky. she was the statue of liberty and aunt jemima and
the girl-you-left-behind to about a half a million doughboys in paris. they had a regular
american house in paris and when they were on leave there when they were away from
the trenches and the killing all the guys went to the american house and talked to
american girls and drank american whiskey and were happy.
lucky was the best one of the bunch the nicest and about the smartest. she would
receive him in her room and she would be stark naked

with a great red scar where somebody
had yanked her appendix. he would come into her room pretty tired at the end of a
night and maybe a little drunk and he would lie down on her bed and put his hands
behind his head and watch lucky. the minute she saw him she would smile and go over
to her dresser and out of the top drawer she would bring a doily. she was always
crocheting on that doily. she would sit at the foot of the bed all brightness and gossip and
friendliness and crochet the doily and talk to him.
lucky had a son. he was six maybe seven years old and lucky was keeping him in a
school on long island. she was going to raise him to be a polo player because polo
players got around and they met all the best people and n

othing was too good for lucky's
son he was such a cute little bastard. figuring out the house percentage and towel
expenses and medical care lucky still made herself from a hundred fifty to two hundred
dollars a week at two dollars apiece. but of course we live it up we got to dress up to our
positions it costs lots in clothes i can tell you but a girl's got to look smart.
lucky had been in the san francisco earthquake. she must have been sixteen or
seventeen then and that would make her almost thirty now. when the earthquake hit san
francisco lucky was on the fourth floor of a hotel on market street. i was entertaining a
gentleman friend and when i first felt that thing hit i said to myself lucky i said that's an
earthquake and you ain't going to be caught dead with no son-of-a-bitch on top of you. so
i pushed him off and i run right down into the street stark naked a

to talk with lucky to be with lucky to lie with lucky was like finding peace in a
heathen country it was like breathing the air of a place you love when you're sick and
dying for a breath of it. to see her smile to hear her bright chatter to watch her bony little
fingers fly as they worked the crochet needle with the night noises of paris a foreign city
just outside the window was enough to make anybody feel better and less lonely.
paris was a strange city a foreign city a dying city a lively city. it had too much life
and too much death and too m

 took him and thus learn the location of their treasures. then they would take
him poor blinded young guy down into the passages under the level of the streets to the
door of the treasure house. there they chained one arm and one leg to the door and one
arm and one leg to the wall so that for anyone to enter the seal would have to be broken
and the seal was the living breathing body of a man. he thought of the carthaginian
slaves down in the darkness blinded and chained and he thought they were lucky guys.
they died soon there was no one there to take care of them to make sure the breath of life
stayed in their bodies as long as possible. they were in agony but they died soon and
even in their agony they could stand on two legs they could pull against their chains.
they could hear and when someone spoke some great noble coming down into the
treasure house they could hear the blessed sound of a human voice.
he thought of the slaves who built the pyramids thousands of them tens of thousands

here'll be
one along pretty soon boys so don't get impatient. it'll come and then you'll have your
chance.
either way you win. if you don't have to fight why you stay at home and make
sixteen bucks a day working in the shipyards. and if they draft you why you've got a
good chance of coming back without so many needs. maybe you'll need only one shoe
instead of two that's saving money. maybe you'll be blind and if you are why then you
never need worry about the expense of glasses. maybe you'll be lucky like me. look at
me close boys i don't need anything. a little broth or something three times a day and
that's all. no shoes no socks no underwear no shirt no gloves no hat no necktie no collarbuttons
no vest no coat no movies no vaudeville no football not even a shave. look at me
boys i have no expenses at all. you're suckers boys. get on the gravy train. i know what
i'm talking about, i used to need all the things that you need right now. i used to be a consumer.
i've consumed a lot in my tim

take me into the schoolhouses all the schoolhouses in the world. suffer little
children to come unto me isn't that right? they may scream at first and have nightmares
at night but they'll get used to it because they've got to get used to it and it's best to start
them young. gather them around my case and say here little girl here little boy come and

to the fields
where no clean animal will touch them and let their chunks rot there and may no green
thing ever grow where they rot. take me into your churches your great towering cathedrals
that have to be rebuilt every fifty years because they are destroyed by war. carry me
in my glass box down the aisles where kings and priests and brides and children at their
confirmation have gone so many times before to kiss a splinter of wood from a true cross
on which was nailed the body of a man who was lucky enough to die. set me high on
your altars and call on god to look down upon his murderous little children his dearly
beloved little children. wave over me the incense i can't smell. swill down the sacramental
wine i can't taste. drone out the prayers i can't hear. go through the old holy
gestures for which i have no legs and no arms. chorus out the hallelujas i can't sing.
bring them out loud and strong for me your hallelujas all of them for me because i know
the truth and you don't you fools.
