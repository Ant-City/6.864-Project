Ilya Ilich Telegin (ilya ilich telegin) - 
      Nicknamed "Waffles" for his pockmarked face, Telegin is an impoverished landowner who works on the estate. He is largely a comic figure, pathetic in his love life, cowed by conflict in the household, and prone to make the occasional inappropriate interjections. He is also the play's on-stage musician, playing the guitar in a number of scenes.
