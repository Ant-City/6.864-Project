privilege of rubbing my head against the head of miss rachelâ€™s cookâ€™s son, who
was afflicted with a tremendous ringworm. it didnâ€™t take.
but i was worrying another bone. â€œdo all lawyers defend n-negroes, atticus?â€
â€œof course they do, scout.â€
â€œthen why did cecil say you defended niggers? he made it sound like you were
runninâ€˜ a still.â€
atticus sighed. â€œiâ€™m simply defending a negroâ€”his nameâ€™s tom robinson. he
lives in that little settlement beyond the town dump. heâ€™s a member of
calpurniaâ€™s church, and cal knows his family well. she says theyâ€™re clean-living
folks. scout, you arenâ€™t old enough to understand some things yet, but thereâ€™s
been some high talk around town to the effect that i shouldnâ€™t do much about
defending this man. itâ€™s a peculiar caseâ€”it wonâ€™t come to trial until summer
session. john taylor was kind enough to give us a postponementâ€¦â€

â€œatticus, how bad is this going to be? you havenâ€™t had too much chance to
discuss it.â€
â€œit couldnâ€™t be worse, jack. the only thing weâ€™ve got is a black manâ€™s word
against the ewellsâ€˜. the evidence boils down to you-didâ€”i-didnâ€™t. the jury
couldnâ€™t possibly be expected to take tom robinsonâ€™s word against the ewellsâ€™â€”
are you acquainted with the ewells?â€
uncle jack said yes, he remembered them. he described them to atticus, but
atticus said, â€œyouâ€™re a generation off. the present ones are the same, though.â€
â€œwhat are you going to do, then?â€
â€œbefore iâ€™m through, i intend to jar the jury a bitâ€”i think weâ€™ll have a reasonable
chance on appeal, though. i really canâ€™t tell at this stage, jack. you know, iâ€™d

school had to keep his head about anything.
â€œscout,â€ said atticus, â€œwhen summer comes youâ€™ll have to keep your head about
far worse thingsâ€¦ itâ€™s not fair for you and jem, i know that, but sometimes we
have to make the best of things, and the way we conduct ourselves when the chips
are downâ€”well, all i can say is, when you and jem are grown, maybe youâ€™ll look
back on this with some compassion and some feeling that i didnâ€™t let you down.
this case, tom robinsonâ€™s case, is something that goes to the essence of a manâ€™s
conscienceâ€”scout, i couldnâ€™t go to church and worship god if i didnâ€™t try to help
that man.â€
â€œatticus, you must be wrongâ€¦â€
â€œhowâ€™s that?â€
â€œwell, most folks seem to think theyâ€™re right and youâ€™re wrongâ€¦â€
â€œtheyâ€™re certainly entitled to think that, and theyâ€™re entitled to full respect for
their opinions,â€ said atticus, â€œbut before i can live with other folks iâ€™ve got to live

i wanted to stay and explore, but calpurnia propelled me up the aisle ahead of
her. at the church door, while she paused to talk with zeebo and his family, jem
and i chatted with reverend sykes. i was bursting with questions, but decided i
would wait and let calpurnia answer them.
â€œwe were â€˜specially glad to have you all here,â€ said reverend sykes. â€œthis
church has no better friend than your daddy.â€
my curiosity burst: â€œwhy were you all takinâ€˜ up collection for tom robinsonâ€™s
wife?â€
â€œdidnâ€™t you hear why?â€ asked reverend sykes. â€œhelenâ€™s got three littleâ€™uns and
she canâ€™t go out to workâ€”â€
â€œwhy canâ€™t she take â€˜em with her, reverend?â€ i asked. it was customary for field
negroes with tiny children to deposit them in whatever shade there was while
their parents workedâ€”usually the babies sat in the shade between two rows of
cotton. those unable to sit were strapped papoose-style on their mothersâ€™ backs,
or resided in extra cotton bags.

before he could answer, i felt calpurniaâ€™s hand on my shoulder. at its pressure i
said, â€œwe thank you for lettinâ€˜ us come.â€ jem echoed me, and we made our way
homeward.
â€œcal, i know tom robinsonâ€™s in jail anâ€˜ heâ€™s done somethinâ€™ awful, but why

calpurnia, in her navy voile dress and tub of a hat, walked between jem and me.
â€œitâ€™s because of what folks say tomâ€™s done,â€ she said. â€œfolks arenâ€™t anxious toâ€”

question. my feathers rose again. â€œyou tryinâ€˜ to tell me what to do?â€
â€œnaw, itâ€™sâ€”heâ€™s got a lot on his mind now, without us worrying him.â€
â€œlike what?â€ atticus didnâ€™t appear to have anything especially on his mind.
â€œitâ€™s this tom robinson case thatâ€™s worryinâ€˜ him to deathâ€”â€
i said atticus didnâ€™t worry about anything. besides, the case never bothered us

polite fiction at the expense of human life,â€ a pronouncement that made me
suspect they had been fussing again.
i sought jem and found him in his room, on the bed deep in thought. â€œhave they
been at it?â€ i asked.
â€œsort of. she wonâ€™t let him alone about tom robinson. she almost said atticus
was disgracinâ€˜ the family. scoutâ€¦ iâ€™m scared.â€
â€œscaredâ€™a what?â€
â€œscared about atticus. somebody might hurt him.â€ jem preferred to remain
mysterious; all he would say to my questions was go on and leave him alone.
next day was sunday. in the interval between sunday school and church when
the congregation stretched its legs, i saw atticus standing in the yard with another
knot of men. mr. heck tate was present, and i wondered if he had seen the light.

himself occasionally from an ever-present gallon jug of cherry wine. he rarely
gathered news; people brought it to him. it was said that he made up every edition
of the maycomb tribune out of his own head and wrote it down on the linotype.
this was believable. something must have been up to haul mr. underwood out.
i caught atticus coming in the door, and he said that theyâ€™d moved tom robinson
to the maycomb jail. he also said, more to himself than to me, that if theyâ€™d kept
him there in the first place there wouldnâ€™t have been any fuss. i watched him take
his seat on the third row from the front, and i heard him rumble, â€œnearer my god

he liked to be by himself in church.

the colored balcony ran along three walls of the courtroom like a second-story
veranda, and from it we could see everything.
the jury sat to the left, under long windows. sunburned, lanky, they seemed to be
all farmers, but this was natural: townfolk rarely sat on juries, they were either
struck or excused. one or two of the jury looked vaguely like dressed-up
cunninghams. at this stage they sat straight and alert.
the circuit solicitor and another man, atticus and tom robinson sat at tables
with their backs to us. there was a brown book and some yellow tablets on the
solicitorâ€™s table; atticusâ€™s was bare. just inside the railing that divided the
spectators from the court, the witnesses sat on cowhide-bottomed chairs. their
backs were to us.

washed her face in a bucket in the corner and said she was all right. i asked her
who hurt her and she said it was tom robinsonâ€”â€
judge taylor, who had been concentrating on his fingernails, looked up as if he
were expecting an objection, but atticus was quiet.
â€œâ€”asked her if he beat her like that, she said yes he had. asked her if he took
advantage of her and she said yes he did. so i went down to robinsonâ€™s house
and brought him back. she identified him as the one, so i took him in. thatâ€™s all
there was to it.â€

â€œwait a minute, sheriff,â€ said atticus. â€œwas it her left facing you or her left
looking the same way you were?â€
mr. tate said, â€œoh yes, thatâ€™d make it her right. it was her right eye, mr. finch. i
remember now, she was bunged up on that side of her faceâ€¦â€
mr. tate blinked again, as if something had suddenly been made plain to him.
then he turned his head and looked around at tom robinson. as if by instinct,
tom robinson raised his head.
something had been made plain to atticus also, and it brought him to his feet.
â€œsheriff, please repeat what you said.â€

â€œit was her right eye, i said.â€
â€œnoâ€¦â€ atticus walked to the court reporterâ€™s desk and bent down to the furiously

atticus seemed to be bordering on another question, but he thought better of it
and said, â€œyes, what were her other injuries?â€ as mr. tate answered, atticus
turned and looked at tom robinson as if to say this was something they hadnâ€™t
bargained for.
â€œâ€¦her arms were bruised, and she showed me her neck. there were definite
finger marks on her gulletâ€”â€
â€œall around her throat? at the back of her neck?â€
â€œiâ€™d say they were all around, mr. finch.â€
â€œyou would?â€

mr. ewell looked confusedly at the judge. â€œwell, mayella was raisinâ€˜ this holy

when i got distangled i run up to thâ€˜ window and i seenâ€”â€ mr. ewellâ€™s face grew

so serene was judge taylorâ€™s court, that he had few occasions to use his gavel,
but he hammered fully five minutes. atticus was on his feet at the bench saying
something to him, mr. heck tate as first officer of the county stood in the middle
aisle quelling the packed courtroom. behind us, there was an angry muffled groan
from the colored people.
reverend sykes leaned across dill and me, pulling at jemâ€™s elbow. â€œmr. jem,â€

mr. gilmer and atticus exchanged glances. atticus was sitting down again, his
fist rested on his cheek and we could not see his face. mr. gilmer looked rather
desperate. a question from judge taylor made him relax: â€œmr. ewell, did you see
the defendant having sexual intercourse with your daughter?â€
â€œyes, i did.â€
the spectators were quiet, but the defendant said something. atticus whispered to
him, and tom robinson was silent.
â€œyou say you were at the window?â€ asked mr. gilmer.
â€œyes sir.â€
â€œhow far is it from the ground?â€
â€œâ€˜bout three foot.â€

â€œyes sir.â€

jem seemed to be having a quiet fit. he was pounding the balcony rail softly, and
once he whispered, â€œweâ€™ve got him.â€
i didnâ€™t think so: atticus was trying to show, it seemed to me, that mr. ewell
could have beaten up mayella. that much i could follow. if her right eye was
blacked and she was beaten mostly on the right side of the face, it would tend to
show that a left-handed person did it. sherlock holmes and jem finch would
agree. but tom robinson could easily be left-handed, too. like mr. heck tate, i
imagined a person facing me, went through a swift mental pantomime, and
concluded that he might have held her with his right hand and pounded her with
his left. i looked down at him. his back was to us, but i could see his broad
shoulders and bull-thick neck. he could easily have done it. i thought jem was
counting his chickens.

â€œmy pawâ€™s never touched a hair oâ€™my head in my life,â€ she declared firmly. â€œhe
never touched me.â€
atticusâ€™s glasses had slipped a little, and he pushed them up on his nose. â€œweâ€™ve
had a good visit, miss mayella, and now i guess weâ€™d better get to the case. you
say you asked tom robinson to come chop up aâ€”what was it?â€

â€œwhaddya mean?â€

mayella nodded. â€œi knowed who he was, he passed the house every day.â€
â€œwas this the first time you asked him to come inside the fence?â€
mayella jumped slightly at the question. atticus was making his slow pilgrimage
to the windows, as he had been doing: he would ask a quest

â€œyes it was.â€
â€œdidnâ€™t you ever ask him to come inside the fence before?â€
she was prepared now. â€œi did not, i certainly did not.â€
â€œone did notâ€™s enough,â€ said atticus serenely. â€œyou never asked him to do odd
jobs for you before?â€
â€œi mighta,â€ conceded mayella. â€œthere was several niggers around.â€
â€œcan you remember any other occasions?â€
â€œno.â€
â€œall right, now to what happened. you said tom robinson was behind you in the

â€œyes.â€
â€œyou said he â€˜got you around the neck cussing and saying dirtâ€™â€”is that right?â€
â€œâ€˜tâ€™s right.â€
atticusâ€™s memory had suddenly become accurate. â€œyou say â€˜he caught me and
choked me and took advantage of meâ€™â€”is that right?â€
â€œthatâ€™s what i said.â€
â€œdo you remember him beating you about the face?â€

â€œthatâ€™s fine,â€ said atticus. â€œthereâ€™re only a few more. miss mayella, not to be
tedious, youâ€™ve testified that the defendant hit you, grabbed you around the neck,
choked you, and took advantage of you. i want you to be sure you have the right
man. will you identify the man who raped you?â€
â€œi will, thatâ€™s him right yonder.â€
atticus turned to the defendant. â€œtom, stand up. let miss mayella have a good
long look at you. is this the man, miss mayella?â€
tom robinsonâ€™s powerful shoulders rippled under his thin shirt. he rose to his
feet and stood with his right hand on the back of his chair. he looked oddly off
balance, but it was not from the way he was standing. his left arm was fully
twelve inches shorter than his right, and hung dead at his side. it ended in a small
shriveled hand, and from as far away as the balcony i could see that it was no use
to him.

mayellaâ€™s face was a mixture of terror and fury. atticus sat down wearily and

judge taylor instinctively reached for his gavel, but let his hand fall. the murmur
below us died without his help.
â€œunder what circumstances?â€

â€œwhy did you go inside the fence lots of times?â€

as tom robinson gave his testimony, it came to me that mayella ewell must
have been the loneliest person in the world. she was even lonelier than boo
radley, who had not been out of the house in twenty-five years. when atticus
asked had she any friends, she seemed not to know what he meant, then she
thought he was making fun of her. she was as sad, i thought, as what jem called a

tom robinson had come to a dead stop. he glanced at atticus, then at the jury,
then at mr. underwood sitting across the room.
â€œtom, youâ€™re sworn to tell the whole truth. will you tell it?â€
tom ran his hand nervously over his mouth.
â€œwhat happened after that?â€

â€œmr. finch, i tried. i tried to â€˜thout beinâ€™ ugly to her. i didnâ€™t wanta be ugly, i
didnâ€™t wanta push her or nothinâ€˜.â€
it occurred to me that in their own way, tom robinsonâ€™s manners were as good
as atticusâ€™s. until my father explained it to me later, i did not understand the
subtlety of tomâ€™s predicament: he would not have dared strike a white woman
under any circumstances and expect to live long, so he took the first opportunity
to runâ€”a sure sign of guilt.
â€œtom, go back once more to mr. ewell,â€ said atticus. â€œdid he say anything to
you?â€
â€œnot anything, suh. he mighta said somethinâ€˜, but i werenâ€™t thereâ€”â€

â€œyes suh.â€
â€œwhy didnâ€™t you do them instead of miss ewellâ€™s?â€
â€œi done â€˜em both, suh.â€
â€œyou must have been pretty busy. why?â€
â€œwhy what, suh?â€
â€œwhy were you so anxious to do that womanâ€™s chores?â€
tom robinson hesitated, searching for an answer. â€œlooked like she didnâ€™t have
nobody to help her, like i saysâ€”â€
â€œwith mr. ewell and seven children on the place, boy?â€

â€œwell, i says it looked like they never help her noneâ€”â€
â€œyou did all this chopping and work from sheer goodness, boy?â€
â€œtried to help her, i says.â€
mr. gilmer smiled grimly at the jury. â€œyouâ€™re a mighty good fellow, it seemsâ€”

the ceiling.
the witness realized his mistake and shifted uncomfortably in the chair. but the
damage was done. below us, nobody liked tom robinsonâ€™s answer. mr. gilmer
paused a long time to let it sink in.
â€œnow you went by the house as usual, last november twenty-first,â€ he said, â€œand
she asked you to come in and bust up a chiffarobe?â€
â€œno suh.â€
â€œdo you deny that you went by the house?â€
â€œno suhâ€”she said she had somethinâ€˜ for me to do inside the houseâ€”â€

to the next ten questions, as mr. gilmer reviewed mayellaâ€™s version of events,
the witnessâ€™s steady answer was that she was mistaken in her mind.

â€œno suh, i donâ€™t think he did.â€

the courtroom was still, and again i wondered where the babies were. judge
taylorâ€™s cigar was a brown speck in the center of his mouth; mr. gilmer was

writing on one of the yellow pads on his table, trying to outdo the court reporter,
whose hand was jerking rapidly. â€œshoot,â€ i muttered, â€œwe missed it.â€
atticus was halfway through his speech to the jury. he had evidently pulled some
papers from his briefcase that rested beside his chair, because they were on his
table. tom robinson was toying with them.
â€œâ€¦absence of any corroborative evidence, this man was indicted on a capital
charge and is now on trial for his lifeâ€¦â€
i punched jem. â€œhow longâ€™s he been at it?â€
â€œheâ€™s just gone over the evidence,â€ jem whispered, â€œand weâ€™re gonna win, scout.
i donâ€™t see how we canâ€™t. heâ€™s been at it â€˜bout five minutes. he made it as plain
and easy asâ€”well, as iâ€™da explained it to you. you couldâ€™ve understood it, even.â€

â€œgentlemen,â€ he was saying, â€œi shall be brief, but i would like to use my
remaining time with you to remind you that this case is not a difficult one, it
requires no minute sifting of complicated facts, but it does require you to be sure
beyond all reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the defendant. to begin with, this
case should never have come to trial. this case is as simple as black and white.
â€œthe state has not produced one iota of medical evidence to the effect that the
crime tom robinson is charged with ever took place. it has relied instead upon
the testimony of two witnesses whose evidence has not only been called into
serious question on cross-examination, but has been flatly contradicted by the
defendant. the defendant is not guilty, but somebody in this courtroom is.
â€œi have nothing but pity in my heart for the chief witness for the state, but my pity
does not extend so far as to her putting a manâ€™s life at stake, which she has done
in an effort to get rid of her own g

breaking it. she persisted, and her subsequent reaction is something that all of us
have known at one time or another. she did something every child has doneâ€”she
tried to put the evidence of her offense away from her. but in this case she was no
child hiding stolen contraband: she struck out at her victimâ€”of necessity she
must put him away from herâ€”he must be removed from her presence, from this
world. she must destroy the evidence of her offense.
â€œwhat was the evidence of her offense? tom robinson, a human being. she must
put tom robinson away from her. tom robinson was her daily reminder of what
she did. what did she do? she tempted a negro.
â€œshe was white, and she tempted a negro. she did something that in our society is
unspeakable: she kissed a black man. not an old uncle, but a strong young negro
man. no code mattered to her before she broke it, but it came crashing down on
her afterwards.

er do? we donâ€™t know, but there is circumstantial evidence to indicate that
mayella ewell was beaten savagely by someone who led almost exclusively with
his left. we do know in part what mr. ewell did: he did what any god-fearing,
persevering, respectable white man would do under the circumstancesâ€”he swore
out a warrant, no doubt signing it with his left hand, and tom robinson now sits
before you, having taken the oath with the only good hand he possessesâ€”his right
hand.
â€œand so a quiet, respectable, humble negro who had the unmitigated temerity to
â€˜feel sorryâ€™ for a white woman has had to put his word against two white
peopleâ€™s. i need not remind you of their appearance and conduct on the standâ€”

the sheriff of maycomb county, have presented themselves to you gentlemen, to

s court, in the cynical confidence that their testimony would not be doubted,
confident that you gentlemen would go along with them on the assumptionâ€”the
evil assumptionâ€”that all negroes lie, that all negroes are basically immoral
beings, that all negro men are not to be trusted around our women, an assumption
one associates with minds of their caliber.
â€œwhich, gentlemen, we know is in itself a lie as black as tom robinsonâ€™s skin, a
lie i do not have to point out to you. you know the truth, and the truth is this:
some negroes lie, some negroes are immoral, some negro men are not to be
trusted around womenâ€”black or white. but this is a truth that applies to the
human race and to no particular race of men. there is not a person in this
courtroom who has never told a lie, who has never done an immoral thing, and
there is no man living who has never looked upon a woman without desire.â€

i remembered something jem had once explained to me when he went through a
brief period of psychical research: he said if enough peopleâ€”a stadium full,
maybeâ€”were to concentrate on one thing, such as setting a tree afire in the
woods, that the tree would ignite of its own accord. i toyed with the idea of asking
everyone below to concentrate on setting tom robinson free, but thought if they
were as tired as i, it wouldnâ€™t work.
dill was sound asleep, his head on jemâ€™s shoulder, and jem was quiet.
â€œainâ€™t it a long time?â€ i asked him.

â€œsure is, scout,â€ he said happily.
â€œwell, from the way you put it, itâ€™d just take five minutes.â€
jem raised his eyebrows. â€œthere are things you donâ€™t understand,â€ he said, and i
was too weary to argue.

talking to atticus, might have been wearing his high boots and lumber jacket.
atticus had stopped his tranquil journey and had put his foot onto the bottom rung
of a chair; as he listened to what mr. tate was saying, he ran his hand slowly up
and down his thigh. i expected mr. tate to say any minute, â€œtake him, mr.
finchâ€¦â€
but mr. tate said, â€œthis court will come to order,â€ in a voice that rang with
authority, and the heads below us jerked up. mr. tate left the room and returned
with tom robinson. he steered tom to his place beside atticus, and stood there.
judge taylor had roused himself to sudden alertness and was sitting up straight,
looking at the empty jury box.
what happened after that had a dreamlike quality: in a dream i saw the jury
return, moving like underwater swimmers, and judge taylorâ€™s voice came from
far away and was tiny. i saw something only a lawyerâ€™s child could be expected
to see, could be expected to watch for, and it was like watching atticus walk into

a jury never looks at a defendant it has convicted, and when this jury came in, not
one of them looked at tom robinson. the foreman handed a piece of paper to
mr. tate who handed it to the clerk who handed it to the judgeâ€¦

i shut my eyes. judge taylor was polling the jury: â€œguiltyâ€¦ guiltyâ€¦ guiltyâ€¦
guiltyâ€¦â€ i peeked at jem: his hands were white from gripping the balcony rail,
and his shoulders jerked as if each â€œguiltyâ€ was a separate stab between them.
judge taylor was saying something. his gavel was in his fist, but he wasnâ€™t using
it. dimly, i saw atticus pushing papers from the table in

to his briefcase. he
snapped it shut, went to the court reporter and said something, nodded to mr.
gilmer, and then went to tom robinson and whispered something to him. atticus
put his hand on tomâ€™s shoulder as he whispered. atticus took his coat off the
back of his chair and pulled it over his shoulder. then he left the courtroom, but
not by his usual exit. he must have wanted to go home the short way, because he
walked quickly down the middle aisle toward the south exit. i followed the top of
his head as he made his way to the door. he did not look up.

we walked home.
aunt alexandra was waiting up. she was in her dressing gown, and i could have
sworn she had on her corset underneath it. â€œiâ€™m sorry, brother,â€ she murmured.
having never heard her call atticus â€œbrotherâ€ before, i stole a glance at jem, but
he was not listening. he would look up at atticus, then down at the floor, and i
wondered if he thought atticus somehow responsible for tom robinsonâ€™s
conviction.
â€œis he all right?â€ aunty asked, indicating jem.
â€œheâ€™ll be so presently,â€ said atticus. â€œit was a little too strong for him.â€ our
father sighed. â€œiâ€™m going to bed,â€ he said. â€œif i donâ€™t wake up in the morning,
donâ€™t call me.â€
â€œi didnâ€™t think it wise in the first place to let themâ€”â€

might as well learn to cope with it.â€

but things are always better in the morning. atticus rose at his usual ungodly hour
and was in the livingroom behind the mobile register when we stumbled in.

jemâ€™s morning face posed the question his sleepy lips struggled to ask.
â€œitâ€™s not time to worry yet,â€ atticus reassured him, as we went to the diningroom.
â€œweâ€™re not through yet. thereâ€™ll be an appeal, you can count on that. gracious

calpurnia said, â€œtom robinsonâ€™s daddy sent you along this chicken this morning.
i fixed it.â€
â€œyou tell him iâ€™m proud to get itâ€”bet they donâ€™t have chicken for breakfast at the
white house. what are these?â€
â€œrolls,â€ said calpurnia. â€œestelle down at the hotel sent â€˜em.â€
atticus looked up at her, puzzled, and she said, â€œyou better step out here and see
whatâ€™s in the kitchen, mr. finch.â€
we followed him. the kitchen table was loaded with enough food to bury the
family: hunks of salt pork, tomatoes,

â€œhis colored friends for one thing, and people like us. people like judge taylor.
people like mr. heck tate. stop eating and start thinking, jem. did it ever strike
you that judge taylor naming atticus to defend that boy was no accident? that
judge taylor might have had his reasons for naming him?â€
this was a thought. court-appointed defenses were usually given to maxwell
green, maycombâ€™s latest addition to the bar, who needed the experience.
maxwell green should have had tom robinsonâ€™s case.
â€œyou think about that,â€ miss maudie was saying. â€œit was no accident. i was sittinâ€˜
there on the porch last night, waiting. i waited and waited to see you all come

down the sidewalk, and as i waited i thought, atticus finch wonâ€™t win, he canâ€™t
win, but heâ€™s the only man in these parts who can keep a jury out so long in a case
like that. and i thought to myself, well, weâ€™re making a stepâ€”itâ€™s just a baby-
step, but itâ€™s a step.â€

â€œi wouldnâ€™t be so sure of that, atticus,â€ she said. â€œhis kindâ€™d do anything to pay
off a grudge. you know how those people are.â€
â€œwhat on earth could ewell do to me, sister?â€
â€œsomething furtive,â€ aunt alexandra said. â€œyou may count on that.â€
â€œnobody has much chance to be furtive in maycomb,â€ atticus answered.
after that, we were not afraid. summer was melting away, and we made the most
of it. atticus assured us that nothing would happen to tom robinson until the

higher court reviewed his case, and that tom had a good chance of going free, or
at least of having a new trial. he was at enfield prison farm, seventy miles away
in chester county. i asked atticus if tomâ€™s wife and children were allowed to
visit him, but atticus said no.
â€œif he loses his appeal,â€ i asked one evening, â€œwhatâ€™ll happen to him?â€
â€œheâ€™ll go to the chair,â€ said atticus, â€œunless the governor commutes his sentence.

jem was sprawled on the sofa reading popular mechanics. he looked up. â€œit ainâ€™t
right. he didnâ€™t kill anybody even if he was guilty. he didnâ€™t take anybodyâ€™s life.â€
â€œyou know rapeâ€™s a capital offense in alabama,â€ said atticus.
â€œyessir, but the jury didnâ€™t have to give him deathâ€”if they wanted to they
couldâ€™ve gave him twenty years.â€
â€œgiven,â€ said atticus. â€œtom robinsonâ€™s a colored man, jem. no jury in this part
of the worldâ€™s going to say, â€˜we think youâ€™re guilty, but not very,â€™ on a charge
like that. it was either a straight acquittal or nothing.â€
jem was shaking his head. â€œi know itâ€™s not right, but i canâ€™t figure out whatâ€™s
wrongâ€”maybe rape shouldnâ€™t be a capital offenseâ€¦â€
atticus dropped his newspaper beside his chair. he said he didnâ€™t have any
quarrel with the rape statute, none what ever, but he did have deep misgivings

well, neither of us was the mayor of birmingham, but i wished i was the

missionary society wouldnâ€™t have time to catch its breath. calpurnia was telling
miss rachelâ€™s cook the other day how bad tom was taking things and she didnâ€™t
stop talking when i came into the kitchen. she said there wasnâ€™t a thing atticus
could do to make being shut up easier for him, that the last thing he said to
atticus before they took him down to the prison camp was, â€œgood-bye, mr.

according to dill, he and jem had just come to the highway when they saw
atticus driving toward them. he looked like he had not seen them, so they both
waved. atticus finally slowed down; when they caught up with him he said,
â€œyouâ€™d better catch a ride back. i wonâ€™t be going home for a while.â€ calpurnia
was in the back seat. jem protested, then pleaded, and atticus said, â€œall right, you
can come with us if you stay in the car.â€
on the way to tom robinsonâ€™s, atticus told them what had happened.
they turned off the highway, rode slowly by the dump and past the ewell
residence, down the narrow lane to the negro cabins. dill said a crowd of black
children were playing marbles in tomâ€™s front yard. atticus parked the car and got
out. calpurnia followed him through the front gate.
dill heard him ask one of the children, â€œwhereâ€™s your mother, sam?â€ and heard
sam say, â€œshe down at sis stevensâ€™s, mr. finch. want me run fetch her?â€

enough to be reprinted in the montgomery advertiser.

how could this be so, i wondered, as i read mr. underwoodâ€™s editorial. senseless

been tried openly and convicted by twelve good men and true; my father had
fought for him all the way. then mr. underwoodâ€™s meaning became clear:
atticus had used every tool available to free men to save tom robinson, but in
the secret courts of menâ€™s hearts atticus had no case. tom was a dead man the
minute mayella ewell opened her mouth and screamed.
the name ewell gave me a queasy feeling. maycomb had lost no time in getting
mr. ewellâ€™s views on tomâ€™s demise and passing them along through that english
channel of gossip, miss stephanie crawford. miss stephanie told aunt
alexandra in jemâ€™s presence (â€œoh foot, heâ€™s old enough to listen.â€) that mr.

judge taylor clumped to the back porch to let ann out and found the screen door
swinging open. a shadow on the corner of the house caught his eye, and that was
all he saw of his visitor. mrs. taylor came home from church to find her husband
in his chair, lost in the writings of bob taylor, with a shotgun across his lap.
the third thing happened to helen robinson, tomâ€™s widow. if mr. ewell was as
forgotten as tom robinson, tom robinson was as forgotten as boo radley. but
tom was not forgotten by his employer, mr. link deas. mr. link deas made a
job for helen. he didnâ€™t really need her, but he said he felt right bad about the
way things turned out. i never knew who took care of her children while helen
was away. calpurnia said it was hard on helen, because she had to walk nearly a
mile out of her way to avoid the ewells, who, according to helen, â€œchunked at
herâ€ the first time she tried to use the public ro
