[CHARACTER] - 
one of the narrators. [CHARACTER] is a beautiful, upper-class woman who
leads the life of a glamorous socialite. she is grounded in the here-and-now,
rarely wondering about the deeper significance of events or the symbolic value
of things--a marked contrast to her friends. she is intensely physical, seeing
her body and her sexuality as her primary means of interacting with the world.
[CHARACTER] is perhaps the most static of the main characters, though she does come to
terms with her own aging.
