 church;
he was undignified, and you must have some dignity about a minister,
mustnâ€™t you, matthew? i thought mr. marshall was decidedly attractive;
but mrs. lynde says he isnâ€™t married, or even engaged, because she made
special inquiries about him, and she says it would never do to have
a young unmarried minister in avonlea, because he might marry in the
congregation and that would make trouble. mrs. lynde is a very farseeing
woman, isnâ€™t she, matthew? iâ€™m very glad theyâ€™ve called mr. allan. i
liked him because his sermon was interesting and he prayed as if he
meant it and not just as if he did it because he was in the habit of it.
mrs. lynde says he isnâ€™t perfect, but she says she supposes we couldnâ€™t
expect a perfect minister for seven hundred and fifty dollars a year,
and anyhow his theology is sound because she questioned him thoroughly
on all the points of doctrine. and she knows his wifeâ€™s people and they
are most respectable and the women are all good housekeepers. mr

the new minister and his wife were a young, pleasant-faced couple, still
on their honeymoon, and full of all good and beautiful enthusiasms for
their chosen lifework. avonlea opened its heart to them from the start.
old and young liked the frank, cheerful young man with his high ideals,
and the bright, gentle little lady who assumed the mistress-ship of the
manse. with mrs. allan anne fell promptly and wholeheartedly in love.
she had discovered another kindred spirit.

â€œmrs. allan is perfectly lovely,â€ she announced one sunday afternoon.
â€œsheâ€™s taken our class and sheâ€™s a splendid teacher. she said right away
she didnâ€™t think it was fair for the teacher to ask all the questions,
and you know, marilla, that is exactly what iâ€™ve always thought. she
said we could ask her any question we liked and i asked ever so many.
iâ€™m good at asking questions, marilla.â

â€œi believe youâ€ was marillaâ€™s emphatic comment.

â€œnobody else asked any except ruby gillis, and she asked if there was
to be a sunday-school picnic this summer. i didnâ€™t think that was a
very proper question to ask because it hadnâ€™t any connection with the
lesson--the lesson was about daniel in the lionsâ€™ den--but mrs. allan
just smiled and said she thought there would be. mrs. allan has a
lovely smile; she has such _exquisite_ dimples in her cheeks. i wish i had
dimples in my cheeks, marilla. iâ€™m not half so skinny as i was when i
came here, but i have no dimples yet. if i had perhaps i could influence
people for good. mrs. allan said we ought always to try to influence
other people for good. she talked so nice about everything. i never knew
before that religion was such a cheerful thing. i always thought it
was kind of melancholy, but mrs. allanâ€™s isnâ€™t, and iâ€™d l

ike to be a
christian if i could be one like her. i wouldnâ€™t want to be one like mr.
superintendent bell.â€

â€œitâ€™s very naughty of you to speak so about mr. bell,â€ said marilla
severely. â€œmr. bell is a real good man.â€

â€œoh, of course heâ€™s good,â€ agreed anne, â€œbut he doesnâ€™t seem to get any
comfort out of it. if i could be good iâ€™d dance and sing all day because
i was glad of it. i suppose mrs. allan is too old to dance and sing and
of course it wouldnâ€™t be dignified in a ministerâ€™s wife. but i can just
feel sheâ€™s glad sheâ€™s a christian and that sheâ€™d be one even if she
could get to heaven without it.â€

â€œi suppose we must have mr. and mrs. allan up to tea someday soon,â€ said
marilla reflectively. â€œtheyâ€™ve been most everywhere but here. let me
see. next wednesday would be a good time to have them. but donâ€™t say a
word to matthew about it, for if he knew they were coming

 heâ€™d find some
excuse to be away that day. heâ€™d got so used to mr. bentley he didnâ€™t
mind him, but heâ€™s going to find it hard to get acquainted with a new
minister, and a new ministerâ€™s wife will frighten him to death.â€

â€œiâ€™ll be as secret as the dead,â€ assured anne. â€œbut oh, marilla, will
you let me make a cake for the occasion? iâ€™d love to do something for
mrs. allan, and you know i can make a pretty good cake by this time.â€

â€œyou can make a layer cake,â€ promised marilla.

monday and tuesday great preparations went on at green gables.
having the minister and his wife to tea was a serious and important
undertaking, and marilla was determined not to be eclipsed by any of
the avonlea housekeepers. anne was wild with excitement and delight. she
talked it all over with diana tuesday night in the twilight, as they
sat on the big red stones by the dryadâ€™s

and cold tongue. weâ€™re to have two kinds of jelly, red and yellow, and
whipped cream and lemon pie, and cherry pie, and three kinds of cookies,
and fruit cake, and marillaâ€™s famous yellow plum preserves that she
keeps especially for ministers, and pound cake and layer cake, and
biscuits as aforesaid; and new bread and old both, in case the minister
is dyspeptic and canâ€™t eat new. mrs. lynde says ministers are dyspeptic,
but i donâ€™t think mr. allan has been a minister long enough for it to
have had a bad effect on him. i just grow cold when i think of my layer
cake. oh, diana, what if it shouldnâ€™t be good! i dreamed last night that
i was chased all around by a fearful goblin with a big layer cake for a
head.â€

â€œitâ€™ll be good, all right,â€ assured diana, who was a very comfortable
sort of friend. â€œiâ€™m sure that piece of the one you made that we had for
lunch in idlewild two weeks ago was perfectly elegant.â€

â€œyes; but cake

mrs. lynde says the government ought to take the matter up, but she says
weâ€™ll never see the day when a tory government will do it. marilla, what
if that cake doesnâ€™t rise?â€

â€œweâ€™ll have plenty without itâ€ was marillaâ€™s unimpassioned way of
looking at the subject.

the cake did rise, however, and came out of the oven as light and
feathery as golden foam. anne, flushed with delight, clapped it together
with layers of ruby jelly and, in imagination, saw mrs. allan eating it
and possibly asking for another piece!

â€œyouâ€™ll be using the best tea set, of course, marilla,â€ she said. â€œcan i
fix the table with ferns and wild roses?â€

â€œi think thatâ€™s all nonsense,â€ sniffed marilla. â€œin my opinion itâ€™s the
eatables that matter and not flummery decorations.â€

â€œmrs. barry had _her_ table decorated,â€ said anne, who was not entirely
guiltless of the wisdom of the serpent, â€œand the minister paid her an
elegant compliment. he said it was a f

allanâ€™s approving smile was almost too much happiness for this world.

matthew was there, having been inveigled into the party only goodness
and anne knew how. he had been in such a state of shyness and
nervousness that marilla had given him up in despair, but anne took him
in hand so successfully that he now sat at the table in his best clothes
and white collar and talked to the minister not uninterestingly.
he never said a word to mrs. allan, but that perhaps was not to be
expected.

all went merry as a marriage bell until anneâ€™s layer cake was passed.
mrs. allan, having already been helped to a bewildering variety,
declined it. but marilla, seeing the disappointment on anneâ€™s face, said
smilingly:

â€œoh, you must take a piece of this, mrs. allan. anne made it on purpose
for you.â€

â€œin that case i must sample it,â€ laughed mrs. allan, helping herself to
a plump triangle, as did also the minister and marilla.

ook a mouthful of hers and a most peculiar expression
crossed her face; not a word did she say, however, but steadily ate away
at it. marilla saw the expression and hastened to taste the cake.

â€œanne shirley!â€ she exclaimed, â€œwhat on earth did you put into that
cake?â€

â€œnothing but what the recipe said, marilla,â€ cried anne with a look of
anguish. â€œoh, isnâ€™t it all right?â€

â€œall right! itâ€™s simply horrible. mr. allan, donâ€™t try to eat it. anne,
taste it yourself. what flavoring did you use?â€

â€œvanilla,â€ said anne, her face scarlet with mortification after tasting
the cake. â€œonly vanilla. oh, marilla, it must have been the baking
powder. i had my suspicions of that bak--â€

â€œbaking powder fiddlesticks! go and bring me the bottle of vanilla you
used.â€

anne fled to the pantry and returned with a small bottle partially
filled with a brown liquid and labeled yellowly, â€œbest vanilla.â€

will never get over laughing at it. oh, marilla, if you have a spark
of christian pity donâ€™t tell me that i must go down and wash the dishes
after this. iâ€™ll wash them when the minister and his wife are gone, but
i cannot ever look mrs. allan in the face again. perhaps sheâ€™ll think i
tried to poison her. mrs. lynde says she knows an orphan girl who tried
to poison her benefactor. but the liniment isnâ€™t poisonous. itâ€™s meant
to be taken internally--although not in cakes. wonâ€™t you tell mrs. allan
so, marilla?â€

â€œsuppose you jump up and tell her so yourself,â€ said a merry voice.

anne flew up, to find mrs. allan standing by her bed, surveying her with
laughing eyes.

â€œmy dear little girl, you mustnâ€™t cry like this,â€

disturbed by anneâ€™s tragic face. â€œwhy, itâ€™s all just a funny mistake
that anybody might make.â€

â€œoh, no, it takes me to make such a mistake,â€ said anne forlornly. â€œand
i wanted to have that cake so nice for you, mrs. allan.â€

â€œyes, i know, dear. and i assure you i appreciate your kindness and
thoughtfulness just as much as if it had turned out all right. now,
you mustnâ€™t cry any more, but come down with me and show me your flower

want to see it, for iâ€™m very much interested in flowers.â€

anne permitted herself to be led down and comforted, reflecting that it
was really providential that mrs. allan was a kindred spirit. nothing

marilla, when anne had just come in from a run to the post office. â€œhave
you discovered another kindred spirit?â€ excitement hung around anne like
a garment, shone in her eyes, kindled in every feature. she had come
dancing up the lane, like a wind-blown sprite, through the mellow
sunshine and lazy shadows of the august evening.

â€œno, marilla, but oh, what do you think? i am invited to tea at the
manse tomorrow afternoon! mrs. allan left the letter for me at the post
office. just look at it, marilla. â€˜miss anne shirley, green gables.â€™
that is the first time i was ever called â€˜miss.â€™ such a thrill as it
gave me! i shall cherish it forever among my choicest treasures.â€

â€œmrs. allan told me she meant to have all the members of her
sunday-school class to tea in turn,â€ said marilla, regarding the
wonderful event very coolly. â€œyou neednâ€™t get in such a fever over it.
do learn to take things calmly, child.â€

 never had tea at a

although iâ€™ve been studying the rules given in the etiquette department
of the family herald ever since i came here. iâ€™m so afraid iâ€™ll do
something silly or forget to do something i should do. would it be
good manners to take a second helping of anything if you wanted to _very_
much?â€

â€œthe trouble with you, anne, is that youâ€™re thinking too much about
yourself. you should just think of mrs. allan and what would be nicest
and most agreeable to her,â€ said marilla, hitting for once in her life
on a very sound and pithy piece of advice. anne instantly realized this.

â€œyou are right, marilla. iâ€™ll try not to think about myself at all.â€

anne evidently got through her visit without any serious breach of
â€œetiquette,â€ for she came home through the twilight, under a great,
high-sprung sky gloried over with trails of saffron and rosy cloud, in
a beatified state of mind and told marill

lane, in and out among the ferns and rustling boughs. anne watched them
as she talked and somehow felt that wind and stars and fireflies were
all tangled up together into something unutterably sweet and enchanting.

â€œoh, marilla, iâ€™ve had a most _fascinating_ time. i feel that i have not
lived in vain and i shall always feel like that even if i should never
be invited to tea at a manse again. when i got there mrs. allan met me
at the door. she was dressed in the sweetest dress of pale-pink organdy,
with dozens of frills and elbow sleeves, and she looked just like a
seraph. i really think iâ€™d like to be a ministerâ€™s wife when i grow up,
marilla. a minister mightnâ€™t mind my red hair because he wouldnâ€™t be
thinking of such worldly things. but then of course one would have to
be naturally good and iâ€™ll never be that, so i suppose thereâ€™s no use in
thinking about it. some people are naturally good, you

are not. iâ€™m one of the others. mrs. lynde says iâ€™m full of original
sin. no matter how hard i try to be good i can never make such a success
of it as those who are naturally good. itâ€™s a good deal like geometry,
i expect. but donâ€™t you think the trying so hard ought to count for
something? mrs. allan is one of the naturally good people. i love her
passionately. you know there are some people, like matthew and mrs.
allan that you can love right off without any trouble. and there are
others, like mrs. lynde, that you have to try very hard to love. you
know you _ought_ to love them because they know so much and are such
active workers in the church, but you have to keep reminding yourself of
it all the time or else you forget. there was another little girl at the
manse to tea, from the white s

ands sunday school. her name was laurette
bradley, and she was a very nice little girl. not exactly a kindred
spirit, you know, but still very nice. we had an elegant tea, and i
think i kept all the rules of etiquette pretty well. after tea mrs.
allan played and sang and she got lauretta and me to sing too.
mrs. allan says i have a good voice and she says i must sing in the
sunday-school choir after this. you canâ€™t think how i was thrilled at
the mere thought. iâ€™ve longed so to sing in the sunday-school choir,
as diana does, but i feared it was an honor i could never aspire to.
lauretta had to go home early because there is a big concert in the
white sands hotel tonight and her sister is to recite at it. lauretta
says that the americans at the hotel give a concert every fortnight in

someday. i just gazed at her in awe. after she had gone mrs. allan and i
had a heart-to-heart talk. i told her everything--about mrs. thomas and
the twins and katie maurice and violetta and coming to green gables and
my troubles over geometry. and would you believe it, marilla? mrs.
allan told me she was a dunce at geometry too. you donâ€™t know how that
encouraged me. mrs. lynde came to the manse just before i left, and what

i tried to make my own little private prayers interesting. he told me
all about the time he broke his ankle when he was a boy. it does seem
so strange to think of superintendent bell ever being a boy. even my
imagination has its limits, for i canâ€™t imagine _that_. when i try to
imagine him as a boy i see him with gray whiskers and spectacles, just
as he looks in sunday school, only small. now, itâ€™s so easy to imagine
mrs. allan as a little girl. mrs. allan has been to see me fourteen
times. isnâ€™t that something to be proud of, marilla? when a ministerâ€™s
wife has so many claims on her time! she is such a cheerful person to
have visit you, too. she never tells you itâ€™s your own fault and she
hopes youâ€™ll be a better girl on account of it. mrs. lynde always told
me that when she came to see me; and she said it in a kind of way that
made me feel she might hope iâ€™d be a better girl but didnâ€™t really

little hall was crowded; all the performers did excellently well, but
anne was the bright particular star of the occasion, as even envy, in
the shape of josie pye, dared not deny.

â€œoh, hasnâ€™t it been a brilliant evening?â€ sighed anne, when it was all
over and she and diana were walking home together under a dark, starry
sky.

â€œeverything went off very well,â€ said diana practically. â€œi guess we
must have made as much as ten dollars. mind you, mr. allan is going to
send an account of it to the charlottetown papers.â€

â€œoh, diana, will we really see our names in print? it makes me thrill to
think of it. your solo was perfectly elegant, diana. i felt prouder than
you did when it was encored. i just said to myself, â€˜it is my dear bosom
friend who is so honored.â€™â€

â€œsheâ€™s actually delighted when anyone writes her name up in a
take-notice for all she pretends to be so mad. but iâ€™m afraid that is an

speeches; but they do slip out so often before you think, donâ€™t they? i
simply canâ€™t talk about josie pye without making an uncharitable speech,
so i never mention her at all. you may have noticed that. iâ€™m trying to
be as much like mrs. allan as i possibly can, for i think sheâ€™s perfect.

ministers are human and have their besetting sins just like everybody
else. i had such an interesting talk with mrs. allan about besetting
sins last sunday afternoon. there are just a few things itâ€™s proper
to talk about on sundays and that is one of them. my besetting sin is
imagining too much and forgetting my duties. iâ€™m striving very hard
to overcome it and now that iâ€™m really thirteen perhaps iâ€™ll get on
better.â€

marilla. â€œyouâ€™ll get a pack of nonsense into your heads and waste time
that should be put on your lessons. reading stories is bad enough but
writing them is worse.â€

â€œbut weâ€™re so careful to put a moral into them all, marilla,â€ explained
anne. â€œi insist upon that. all the good people are rewarded and all
the bad ones are suitably punished. iâ€™m sure that must have a wholesome
effect. the moral is the great thing. mr. allan says so. i read one of
my stories to him and mrs. allan and they both agreed that the moral was
excellent. only they laughed in the wrong places. i like it better when
people cry. jane and ruby almost always cry when i come to the pathetic
parts. diana wrote her aunt josephine about our club and her aunt
josephine wrote back that we were to send her some of our stories. so
we copied out four of our very best and sent them. miss josephine barry

kind of puzzled us because the stories were all very pathetic and almost
everybody died. but iâ€™m glad miss barry liked them. it shows our club
is doing some good in the world. mrs. allan says that ought to be our
object in everything. i do really try to make it my object but i forget
so often when iâ€™m having fun. i hope i shall be a little like mrs. allan
when i grow up. do you think there is any prospect of it, marilla?â€

â€œi shouldnâ€™t say there was a great dealâ€ was marillaâ€™s encouraging
answer. â€œiâ€™m sure mrs. allan was never such a silly, forgetful little
girl as you are.â€

â€œno; but she wasnâ€™t always so good as she is now either,â€ said anne
seriously. â€œshe told me so herself--that is, she said she was a dreadful
mischief when she was a girl and was always getting into scrapes. i felt
so encouraged when i heard that. is

â€œiâ€™ll settle miss anne when she comes home,â€ said marilla grimly, as
she shaved up kindlings with a carving knife and with more vim than was
strictly necessary. matthew had come in and was waiting patiently for
his tea in his corner. â€œsheâ€™s gadding off somewhere with diana, writing
stories or practicing dialogues or some such tomfoolery, and never
thinking once about the time or her duties. sheâ€™s just got to be pulled
up short and sudden on this sort of thing. i donâ€™t care if mrs. allan
does say sheâ€™s the brightest and sweetest child she ever knew. she may
be bright and sweet enough, but her head is full of nonsense and thereâ€™s
never any knowing what shape itâ€™ll break out in next. just as soon as
she grows out of one freak she takes up with another. but there! here i

â€œif i was wicked i meant to be wicked to some purpose. he said it would
turn my hair a beautiful raven black--he positively assured me that it
would. how could i doubt his word, marilla? i know what it feels like
to have your word doubted. and mrs. allan says we should never suspect
anyone of not telling us the truth unless we have proof that theyâ€™re
not. i have proof now--green hair is proof enough for anybody. but i
hadnâ€™t then and i believed every word he said _implicitly_.â€

in a dangerous plight. at this rate the flat would fill and sink long
before it could drift to the lower headland. where were the oars? left
behind at the landing!

anne gave one gasping little scream which nobody ever heard; she was
white to the lips, but she did not lose her self-possession. there was
one chance--just one.

â€œi was horribly frightened,â€ she told mrs. allan the next day, â€œand it
seemed like years while the flat was drifting down to the bridge and the
water rising in it every moment. i prayed, mrs. allan, most earnestly,
but i didnâ€™t shut my eyes to pray, for i knew the only way god could
save me was to let the flat float close enough to one of the bridge
piles for me to climb up on it. you know the piles are just old tree
trunks and there are lots of knots and old branch stubs on them. it was
proper to pray, but i had to do my part by watching

donâ€™t think much about making a flowery prayer. but mine was answered,
for the flat bumped right into a pile for a minute and i flung the scarf
and the shawl over my shoulder and scrambled up on a big providential
stub. and there i was, mrs. allan, clinging to that slippery old pile
with no way of getting up or down. it was a very unromantic position,
but i didnâ€™t think about that at the time. you donâ€™t think much about
romance when you have just escaped from a watery grave. i said a
grateful prayer at once and then i gave all my attention to holding on
tight, for i knew i should probably have to depend on human aid to get
back to dry land.â€

when evening comes i think itâ€™s lovelier still.â€

â€œcharlotte gillis is going to be married in the church after all and
mrs. allan wants us to decorate it,â€ cried anne.

â€œno. charlotteâ€™s beau wonâ€™t agree to that, because nobody ever has been
married in the church yet, and he thinks it would seem too much like a
funeral. itâ€™s too mean, because it would be such fun. guess again.â€

everything, and i felt sure it wouldnâ€™t do to tell her that. itâ€™s always
wrong to do anything you canâ€™t tell the ministerâ€™s wife. itâ€™s as good as
an extra conscience to have a ministerâ€™s wife for your friend. and i was
very glad i didnâ€™t bet, because the red horse _did_ win, and i would have
lost ten cents. so you see that virtue was its own reward. we saw a man
go up in a balloon. iâ€™d love to go up in a balloon, marilla; it would
be simply thrilling; and we saw a man

 and its only your
guilty conscience thatâ€™s the matter with you. you have no business to be
taking storybooks to school. you read too many novels anyhow. when i was
a girl i wasnâ€™t so much as allowed to look at a novel.â€

â€œoh, how can you call ben hur a novel when itâ€™s really such a religious
book?â€ protested anne. â€œof course itâ€™s a little too exciting to be
proper reading for sunday, and i only read it on weekdays. and i never
read _any_ book now unless either miss stacy or mrs. allan thinks it is a
proper book for a girl thirteen and three-quarters to read. miss stacy
made me promise that. she found me reading a book one day called, the
lurid mystery of the haunted hall. it was one ruby gillis had lent me,
and, oh, marilla, it was so fascinating and creepy. it just curdled the
blood in my veins. but miss stacy said it was a very silly, unwholesome
book, and she asked me not to read any more of it or any like it. i
didnâ€™t mind promising not to read any more like it, but it

gent.â€ not for worlds would marilla have told anne just what
miss stacy had said about her; that would have been to pamper vanity.
â€œyou neednâ€™t rush to any extreme of killing yourself over your books.
there is no hurry. you wonâ€™t be ready to try the entrance for a year and
a half yet. but itâ€™s well to begin in time and be thoroughly grounded,
miss stacy says.â€

â€œi shall take more interest than ever in my studies now,â€ said anne
blissfully, â€œbecause i have a purpose in life. mr. allan says everybody
should have a purpose in life and pursue it faithfully. only he says
we must first make sure that it is a worthy purpose. i would call it a
worthy purpose to want to be a teacher like miss stacy, wouldnâ€™t you,
marilla? i think itâ€™s a very noble profession.â€

the queenâ€™s class was organized in due time. gilbert blythe, anne
shirley, ruby gillis, jane andrews, josie pye, charlie sloane, and moody
spurgeon macpherson joined it. diana barry did not, as her parents
did not int

ne saw diana go slowly out with the others, to walk home alone through
the birch path and violet vale, it was all the former could do to keep
her seat and refrain from rushing impulsively after her chum. a lump
came into her throat, and she hastily retired behind the pages of her
uplifted latin grammar to hide the tears in her eyes. not for worlds
would anne have had gilbert blythe or josie pye see those tears.

â€œbut, oh, marilla, i really felt that i had tasted the bitterness of
death, as mr. allan said in his sermon last sunday, when i saw diana go
out alone,â€ she said mournfully that night. â€œi thought how splendid it
would have been if diana had only been going to study for the entrance,
too. but we canâ€™t have things perfect in this imperfect world, as mrs.
lynde says. mrs. lynde isnâ€™t exactly a comforting person sometimes, but
thereâ€™s no doubt she says a great many very true things. and i think the
queenâ€™s class is going to be extremely interesting. jane and ruby

liatory scorn. the only poor comfort he had was that she snubbed
charlie sloane, unmercifully, continually, and undeservedly.

otherwise the winter passed away in a round of pleasant duties and
studies. for anne the days slipped by like golden beads on the necklace
of the year. she was happy, eager, interested; there were lessons to be
learned and honor to be won; delightful books to read; new pieces to be
practiced for the sunday-school choir; pleasant saturday afternoons at
the manse with mrs. allan; and then, almost before anne realized it,
spring had come again to green gables and all the world was abloom once
more.

studies palled just a wee bit then; the queenâ€™s class, left behind in
school while the others scattered to green lanes and leafy wood cuts and
meadow byways, looked wistfully out of the windows and discovered that
latin verbs and french exercises had somehow lost the tang and zest they
had possessed in the crisp winter months. even anne and gilbert lagged
and grew indiffer

content; and when september came she was bright-eyed and alert, with a
step that would have satisfied the spencervale doctor and a heart full
of ambition and zest once more.

â€œi feel just like studying with might and main,â€ she declared as she
brought her books down from the attic. â€œoh, you good old friends, iâ€™m
glad to see your honest faces once more--yes, even you, geometry. iâ€™ve
had a perfectly beautiful summer, marilla, and now iâ€™m rejoicing as a
strong man to run a race, as mr. allan said last sunday. doesnâ€™t mr.
allan preach magnificent sermons? mrs. lynde says he is improving every
day and the first thing we know some city church will gobble him up
and then weâ€™ll be left and have to turn to and break in another green
preacher. but i donâ€™t see the use of meeting trouble halfway, do you,
marilla? i think it would be better just to enjoy mr. allan while we
have him. if i were a man i think iâ€™d be a minister. they can have
such an influence for good, if their theology

o much over that after this. but i dare say
thereâ€™ll be other things to worry me. they keep coming up new all the
time--things to perplex you, you know. you settle one question and
thereâ€™s another right after. there are so many things to be thought over
and decided when youâ€™re beginning to grow up. it keeps me busy all the
time thinking them over and deciding what is right. itâ€™s a serious thing
to grow up, isnâ€™t it, marilla? but when i have such good friends as
you and matthew and mrs. allan and miss stacy i ought to grow up
successfully, and iâ€™m sure it will be my own fault if i donâ€™t. i feel
itâ€™s a great responsibility because i have only the one chance. if i
donâ€™t grow up right i canâ€™t go back and begin over again. iâ€™ve grown two
inches this summer, marilla. mr. gillis measured me at rubyâ€™s party. iâ€™m
so glad you made my new dresses longer. that dark-green one is so pretty
and it was sweet of you to put on the flounce. of course i know it

lightedly. â€œi knew you could beat them all easy.â€

â€œyouâ€™ve done pretty well, i must say, anne,â€ said marilla, trying to
hide her extreme pride in anne from mrs. rachelâ€™s critical eye. but that
good soul said heartily:

â€œi just guess she has done well, and far be it from me to be backward in
saying it. youâ€™re a credit to your friends, anne, thatâ€™s what, and weâ€™re
all proud of you.â€

that night anne, who had wound up the delightful evening with a serious
little talk with mrs. allan at the manse, knelt sweetly by her open
window in a great sheen of moonshine and murmured a prayer of gratitude
and aspiration that came straight from her heart. there was in it
thankfulness for the past and reverent petition for the future; and when
she slept on her white pillow her dreams were as fair and bright and
beautiful as maidenhood might desire.

pink roses and the pink silk curtains of
anneâ€™s early visions had certainly never materialized; but her dreams
had kept pace with her growth, and it is not probable she lamented
them. the floor was covered with a pretty matting, and the curtains that
softened the high window and fluttered in the vagrant breezes were of
pale-green art muslin. the walls, hung not with gold and silver brocade
tapestry, but with a dainty apple-blossom paper, were adorned with a few
good pictures given anne by mrs. allan. miss stacyâ€™s photograph occupied
the place of honor, and anne made a sentimental point of keeping fresh
flowers on the bracket under it. tonight a spike of white lilies faintly
perfumed the room like the dream of a fragrance. there was no â€œmahogany
furniture,â€ but there was a white-painted bookcase filled with books, a
cushioned wicker rocker, a toilet table befrilled with white muslin,
a quaint, gilt-framed mirror with chubby pink cupids and purple grapes
painted over its arched top, th

anne, who, she vowed, must, for the credit of avonlea, be dressed and
combed and adorned to the queenâ€™s taste.

â€œpull out that frill a little more--so; here, let me tie your sash; now
for your slippers. iâ€™m going to braid your hair in two thick braids,
and tie them halfway up with big white bows--no, donâ€™t pull out a single
curl over your forehead--just have the soft part. there is no way you do
your hair suits you so well, anne, and mrs. allan says you look like a
madonna when you part it so. i shall fasten this little white house rose
just behind your ear. there was just one on my bush, and i saved it for
you.â€

â€œshall i put my pearl beads on?â€ asked anne. â€œmatthew brought me a
string from town last week, and i know heâ€™d like to see them on me.â€

diana pursed up her lips, put her black head on one side critically,
and finally pronounced in favor of the beads, which were thereupon tied
around anneâ€™s slim milk-white thro

pale green material.

â€œanne, hereâ€™s something for a nice light dress for you. i donâ€™t suppose
you really need it; youâ€™ve plenty of pretty waists; but i thought maybe
youâ€™d like something real dressy to wear if you were asked out anywhere
of an evening in town, to a party or anything like that. i hear that
jane and ruby and josie have got â€˜evening dresses,â€™ as they call them,
and i donâ€™t mean you shall be behind them. i got mrs. allan to help me
pick it in town last week, and weâ€™ll get emily gillis to make it for
you. emily has got taste, and her fits arenâ€™t to be equaled.â€

â€œoh, marilla, itâ€™s just lovely,â€ said anne. â€œthank you so much. i donâ€™t
believe you ought to be so kind to me--itâ€™s making it harder every day
for me to go away.â€

the green dress was made up with as many tucks and frills and shirrings
as emilyâ€™s taste permitted. anne put it on one evening for matthewâ€™s
and marillaâ€™s benefit, an

right out and he said heâ€™d think of it. but mr. russell told him
yesterday that the bank was all right.â€

anne had her good day in the companionship of the outdoor world. she
never forgot that day; it was so bright and golden and fair, so free
from shadow and so lavish of blossom. anne spent some of its rich hours
in the orchard; she went to the dryadâ€™s bubble and willowmere and violet
vale; she called at the manse and had a satisfying talk with mrs. allan;
and finally in the evening she went with matthew for the cows, through
loversâ€™ lane to the back pasture. the woods were all gloried through
with sunset and the warm splendor of it streamed down through the hill
gaps in the west. matthew walked slowly with bent head; anne, tall and
erect, suited her springing step to his.

â€œyouâ€™ve been working too hard today, matthew,â€ she said reproachfully.
â€œwhy wonâ€™t you take things easier?â€

â€œwell now, i canâ€™t seem to,â€ said matthew, as

 her the old inrush of
gladness when she saw them--that dianaâ€™s visits were pleasant to her
and that dianaâ€™s merry words and ways moved her to laughter and
smiles--that, in brief, the beautiful world of blossom and love and
friendship had lost none of its power to please her fancy and thrill her
heart, that life still called to her with many insistent voices.

â€œit seems like disloyalty to matthew, somehow, to find pleasure in
these things now that he has gone,â€ she said wistfully to mrs. allan
one evening when they were together in the manse garden. â€œi miss him so
much--all the time--and yet, mrs. allan, the world and life seem very
beautiful and interesting to me for all. today diana said something
funny and i found myself laughing. i thought when it happened i could
never laugh again. and it somehow seems as if i oughtnâ€™t to.â€

â€œwhen matthew was here he liked to hear you laugh and he liked to know
that you found pleasure in the pleasant things around you,â€ said mrs.

their thorny stems. it made me feel glad that i could plant it by his
grave--as if i were doing something that must please him in taking it
there to be near him. i hope he has roses like them in heaven. perhaps
the souls of all those little white roses that he has loved so many
summers were all there to meet him. i must go home now. marilla is all
alone and she gets lonely at twilight.â€

â€œshe will be lonelier still, i fear, when you go away again to college,â€
 said mrs. allan.

anne did not reply; she said good night and went slowly back to green
gables. marilla was sitting on the front door-steps and anne sat down
beside her. the door was open behind them, held back by a big pink conch
shell with hints of sea sunsets in its smooth inner convolutions.

anne gathered some sprays of pale-yellow honeysuckle and put them in
her hair. she liked the delicious hint of fragrance, as some aerial
benediction, above her every time she moved.

â€œdoctor spencer was here while y

ssed girl!â€ said marilla, yielding. â€œi feel as if youâ€™d given me
new life. i guess i ought to stick out and make you go to college--but
i know i canâ€™t, so i ainâ€™t going to try. iâ€™ll make it up to you though,
anne.â€

when it became noised abroad in avonlea that anne shirley had given up
the idea of going to college and intended to stay home and teach there
was a good deal of discussion over it. most of the good folks, not
knowing about marillaâ€™s eyes, thought she was foolish. mrs. allan did
not. she told anne so in approving words that brought tears of pleasure
to the girlâ€™s eyes. neither did good mrs. lynde. she came up one evening
and found anne and marilla sitting at the front door in the warm,
scented summer dusk. they liked to sit there when the twilight came down
and the white moths flew about in the garden and the odor of mint filled
the dewy air.

mrs. rachel deposited her substantial person upon the stone bench by the
door, behind which grew a row of tall pink and y
