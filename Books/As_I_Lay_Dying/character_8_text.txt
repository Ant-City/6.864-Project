anse. it was not that i could think of myself as no longer unvirgin, because i 
was three now. and when i would think cash and darl that way until their names 
would die and solidify into a shape and then fade away, i would say, all right.

sin and love and fear are-just sounds that people who never sinned nor loved nor 
feared have for what they never had and cannot have until they forget the words. 
like cora, who could never even cook.
