[CHARACTER] - 
                the
novel's tragicomic hero. [CHARACTER]'s main quest in life is to
revive knight-errantry in a world devoid of chivalric virtues and
values. he believes only what he chooses to believe and sees the
world very differently from most people. honest, dignified, proud, and
idealistic, he wants to save the world. as intelligent as he is
mad, [CHARACTER] starts out as an absurd and isolated figure and
ends up as a pitiable and lovable old man whose strength and wisdom
have failed him.
