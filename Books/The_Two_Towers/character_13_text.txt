`did you see them again, mr. frodo?' asked sam, as they sat, stiff and chilled, munching wafers of lembas, in the cold grey of early morning.
'no,' said frodo. `i've heard nothing, and seen nothing, for two nights now.'
`nor me,' said sam. `grrr! those eyes did give me a turn! but perhaps we've shaken him off at last, the miserable slinker. gollum! i'll give him gollum in his throat, if ever i get my hands on his neck.'
'i hope you'll never need to,' said frodo. `i don't know how he followed us; but it may be that he's lost us again, as you say. in this dry bleak land we can't leave many footprints, nor much scent, even for his snuffling nose.'
'i hope that's the way of it,' said sam. 'i wish we could be rid of him for good!'
'so do i,' said frodo; 'but he's not my chief trouble. i wish we could get away from these hills! i hate them. i feel all naked on the e

s where there was no hold even for his strong hobbit fingers and the ledges were far apart. but at last he too was down.
`well!' he cried. `we've done it! we've escaped from the emyn muil! and now what next, i wonder? maybe we shall soon be sighing for good hard rock under foot again.'
but sam did not answer: he was staring back up the cliff. `ninnyhammers! ' he said. `noodles! my beautiful rope! there it is tied to a stump, and we're at the bottom. just as nice a little stair for that slinking gollum as we could leave. better put up a signpost to say which way we've gone! i thought it seemed a bit too easy.'
`if you can think of any way we could have both used the rope and yet brought it down with us, then you can pass on to me ninnyhammer, or any other name your gaffer gave you,' said frodo. `climb up and untie it and let yourself down, if you want to!'
sam scratched his head. `no, i can't think how, begging your pardon,' he said. `but i don't like leaving it, and that's a fact.' he stroked

us - it hurts our eyes.'
he was getting lower now and the hisses became sharper and clearer. 'where iss it, where iss it: my precious, my precious? it's ours, it is, and we wants it. the thieves, the thieves, the filthy little thieves. where are they with my precious? curse them! we hates them.'
`it doesn't sound as if he knew we were here, does it? ' whispered sam. `and what's his precious? does he mean the'
`hsh! ' breathed frodo. 'he's getting near now, near enough to hear a whisper.'
indeed gollum had suddenly paused again, and his large head on its scrawny neck was lolling from side to side as if he was listening. his pale eyes were half unlidded. sam restrained himself, though his fingers were twitching. his eyes, filled with anger and disgust, were fixed on the wretched creature as he now began to move again, still whispering and hissing to himself.
at last he was no more than a dozen feet from the ground, right above their heads. from that point there was a sheer drop, for the cliff w

as slightly undercut, and even gollum could not find a hold of any kind. he seemed to be trying to twist round, so as to go legs first, when suddenly with a shrill whistling shriek he fell. as he did so, he curled his legs and arms up round him, like a spider whose descending thread is snapped.
sam was out of his hiding in a flash and crossed the space between him and the cliff foot in a couple of leaps. before gollum could get up, he was on top of him. but he found gollum more than he bargained for, even taken like that, suddenly, off his guard after a fall. before sam could get a hold, long legs and arms were wound round him pinning his arms, and a clinging grip, soft but horribly strong, was squeezing him like slowly tightening cords; clammy fingers were feeling for his throat. then sharp teeth bit into his shoulder. all he could do was to butt his hard round head sideways into the creature's face. gollum hissed and spat, but he did not let go.

e gone ill with sam, if he had been alone. but frodo sprang up, and drew sting from its sheath. with his left hand he drew back gollum's head by his thin lank hair, stretching his long neck, and forcing his pale venomous eyes to stare up at the sky.
`let go! gollum,' he said. `this is sting. you have seen it before once upon a time. let go, or you'll feel it this time! i'll cut your throat.'
gollum collapsed and went as loose as wet string. sam got up, fingering his shoulder. his eyes smouldered with anger, but he could not avenge himself: his miserable enemy lay grovelling on the stones whimpering.
`don't hurt us! don't let them hurt us, precious! they won't hurt us will they, nice little hobbitses? we didn't mean no harm, but they jumps on us like cats on poor mices, they did, precious. and we're so lonely, gollum. we'll be nice to them, very nice, if they'll be nice to us, won't we, yes

bitses. tie us up in the cold hard lands and leave us, gollum, gollum.' sobs welled up in his gobbling throat.
`no,' said frodo. `if we kill him, we must kill him outright. but we can't do that, not as things are. poor wretch! he has done us no harm.'
`oh hasn't he! ' said sam rubbing his shoulder. `anyway he meant to, and he means to, i'll warrant. throttle us in our sleep, that's his plan.'
'i daresay,' said frodo. `but what he means to do is another matter.' he paused for a while in thought. gollum lay still, but stopped whimpering. sam stood glowering over him.
it seemed to frodo then that he heard, quite plainly but far off, voices out of the past:
what a pity bilbo did not stub the vile creature, when he had a chance!
pity? it was pity that stayed his hand. pity, and mercy: not to strike without need.
i do not feel any pity for gollum. he deserves death.
deserves death! i daresay he does. many that live deserve death. and some die that deserve life. can you give that to them? then be no

`very well,' he answered aloud, lowering his sword. 'but still i am afraid. and yet, as you see, i will not touch the creature. for now that i see him, i do pity him.'
sam stared at his master, who seemed to be speaking to some one who was not there. gollum lifted his head.
'yess, wretched we are, precious,' he whined. 'misery misery! hobbits won't kill us, nice hobbits.'
'no, we won't,' said frodo. `but we won't let you go, either. you're full of wickedness and mischief, gollum. you will have to come with us, that's all, while we keep an eye on you. but you must help us, if you can. one good turn deserves another.'
'yess, yes indeed,' said gollum sitting up. 'nice hobbits! we will come with them. find them safe paths in the dark, yes we will. and

ong hand into a bony fleshless knot, shaking it towards the east. 'we won't! ' he cried. 'not for you.' then he collapsed again. 'gollum, gollum,' he whimpered with his face to the ground. 'don't look at us! go away! go to sleep!'
`he will not go away or go to sleep at your command, sméagol,' said frodo. `but if you really wish to be free of him again. then you must help me. and that i fear means finding us a path towards him. but you need not go all the way, not beyond the gates of his land.'
gollum sat up again and looked at him under his eyelids. 'he's over there,' he cackled. `always there. orcs will take you all the way. easy to find orcs east of the river. don't ask sméagol. poor, poor sméagol, he went away long ago. they took his precious, and he's lost now.'
`perhaps we'll find him again, if you come with us,' said frodo.
'no, no, never! he's lost his precious,' said gollum.
'get up! ' said frodo.
gollum stood up and backed away against the cliff.
`now! ' said frodo. 'can you find

a path easier by day or by night? we're tired; but if you choose the night, we'll start tonight.'
`the big lights hurt our eyes, they do,' gollum whined. `not under the white face, not yet. it will go behind the hills soon, yess. rest a bit first, nice hobbits!'
`then sit down,' said frodo, `and don't move!'
the hobbits seated themselves beside him, one on either side. with their backs to the stony wall, resting their legs. there was no need for any arrangement by word: they knew that they must not sleep for a moment. slowly the moon went by. shadows fell down from the hills, and all grew dark before them. the stars grew thick and bright

in the sky above. no one stirred. gollum sat with his legs drawn up, knees under chin, flat hands and feet splayed on the ground, his eyes closed; but he seemed tense, as if thinking or listening.
frodo looked across at sam. their eyes met and they understood. they relaxed, leaning their heads back, and shutting their eyes or seeming to. soon the sound of their soft breathing could be heard. gollum's hands twitched a little. hardly perceptibly his head moved to the left and the right, and first one eye and then the other opened a slit.

 the hobbits made no sign.
suddenly, with startling agility and speed, straight off the ground with a jump like a grasshopper or a frog. gollum bounded forward into the darkness. but that was just what frodo and sam had expected. sam was on him before he had gone two paces after his spring. frodo coming behind grabbed his leg and threw him.
'your rope might prove useful again, sam.' he said.
sam got out the rope. 'and where were you off to in the cold hard lands, mr. gollum?' he growled. 'we wonders. aye, we wonders. to find some of your orc-friends, i warrant. you nasty treacherous creature. it's round your neck this rope ought to go,

and a tight noose too.'
gollum lay quiet and tried no further tricks. he did not answer sam, but gave him a swift venomous look.
`all we need is something to keep a hold on him,' said frodo. 'we want him to walk, so it's no good tying his legs-or his arms. he seems to use them nearly as much. tie one end to his ankle, and keep a grip on the other end.'
he stood over gollum, while sam tied the knot. the result surprised them both. gollum began to scream, a thin, tearing sound, very horrible to hear. he writhed, and tried to get his mouth to his ankle and bite the rope. he kept on screaming.
at last frodo was convinced that he really was in pain; but it could not be from the knot. he examined it and found that it was not too tight, indeed hardly tight enough. sam was gentler than his words. 'what's the matter with you? ' he said. `if you will try to run away. you must be tied; but we don't wish to hurt you.'
'it hurts us, it hurt

l hobbits! that's why we tries to escape, of course it is, precious. we guessed they were cruel hobbits. they visits elves, fierce elves with bright eyes. take it off us! it hurts us.'
`no, i will not take it off you,' said frodo, `not unless' - he paused a moment in thought - `not unless there is any promise you can make that i can trust.'
'we will swear to do what he wants, yes, yess, said gollum, still twisting and grabbling at his ankle. `it hurts us.'
`swear? ' said frodo.
'sméagol,' said gollum suddenly and clearly, opening his eyes wide and staring at frodo with a strange light. 'sméagol will swear on the precious.'
frodo drew himself up, and again sam was startled by his words and his stern voice. 'on the precious? how dare you? ' he said. 'think!
one ring to rule them all and in the darkness bind them.
would you commit your promise to that, sméagol? it will hold you. but it is more treacherous than you are. it may twist your words. beware!'
gollum cowered. 'on the precious. on the

m, as if the words shook his very bones with fear. 'sméagol will swear never, never, to let him have it. never! sméagol will save it. but he must swear on the precious.'
'no! not on it,' said frodo, looking down at him with stern pity. 'all you wish is to see it and touch it, if you can, though you know it would drive you mad. not on it. swear by it, if you will. for you know where it is. yes, you know, sméagol. it is before you.'
for a moment it appeared to sam that his master had grown and gollum had shrunk: a tall stern shadow, a mighty lord who hid his brightness in grey cloud, and at his feet a little whining dog. yet the two were in some way akin and not alien: they could reach one another's minds. gollum raised himself and began pawing at frodo, fawning at his knees.
'down! down! ' said frodo. `now speak your promise!'
`we promises, yes i promise!' said gollum. 'i will serve the master of the precious. good master, good sméagol, gollum, gollum!' suddenly he began to weep and bite a

t his ankle again.
'take the rope off, sam!' said frodo.
reluctantly sam obeyed. at once gollum got up and began prancing about, like a whipped cur whose master has patted it. from that moment a change, which lasted for some time, came over him. he spoke with less hissing and whining, and he spoke to his companions direct, not to his precious self. he would cringe and flinch, if they stepped near him or made any sudden movement, and he avoided the touch of their elven-cloaks; but he was friendly, and indeed pitifully anxious to please. he would cackle with laughter and caper, if any jest w

 orcs don't use it, orcs don't know it. orcs don't cross the marshes, they go round for miles and miles. very lucky you came this way. very lucky you found sméagol, yes. follow sméagol!'
he took a few steps away and looked back inquiringly, like a dog inviting them for a walk. 'wait a bit, gollum!' cried sam. `not too far ahead now! i'm going to be at your tail, and i've got the rope handy.'
'no, no! ' said gollum. 'sméagol promised.'
in the deep of night under hard clear stars they set off. gollum led them back northward for a while along the way they had come; then he slanted to the right away from the steep edge of the emyn muil, down the broken stony slopes towards the vast fens below. they faded swiftly and softly into the darkness. over all the leagues of waste before the gates of mordor there was a black silence.

 up with him; but he seemed no longer to have any thought of escaping, and if they fell behind, he would turn and wait for them. after a time he brought them to the brink of the narrow gully that they had struck before; but they were now further from the hills.
`here it is!' he cried. 'there is a way down inside, yes. now we follows it - out, out away over there.' he pointed south and east towards the marshes. the reek of them came to their nostrils, heavy and foul even in the cool night air. .
gollum cast up and down along the brink, and at length he called to them. `here! we can get down here. sméagol went this way once: i went this way, hiding from orcs.'
he led the way, and following him the hobbits climbed down into the gloom. it was not difficult, for the rift was at this point only some fifteen feet deep and about a dozen across. there was running water at the bottom: it was in fact the bed of one of the many small rivers that trickled down from the hills to feed the stagnant pools an

they gnaws our feet.
the rocks and stones
are like old bones
all bare of meat.
but stream and pool

so nice for feet!

'ha! ha! what does we wish?' he said, looking sidelong at the hobbits. 'we'll tell

these words only made more pressing to sam's mind a problem that had been troubling him from the moment when he understood that hir master was going to adopt gollum as a guide: the problem of food. it did not occur to him that his master might also have thought of it. hut he supposed gollum had. indeed how had gollum kept himself in all his lonely wandering? 'not too well,' thought sam. 'he looks fair famished. not too dainty to try what hobbit tastes like if there ain't no fish, i'll wager - supposing as he could catch us napping. well, he won't: not sam gamgee for one.'
they stumbled along in the dark winding gully for a long time, or so it seemed to the

tired feet of frodo and sam. the gully turned eastward, and as they went on it broadened and got gradually shallower. at last the sky above grew faint with the first grey of morning. gollum had shown no signs of tiring, but now he looked up and halted.
`day is near,' he whispered, as if day was something that might overhear him and spring on him. `sméagol will stay here: i will stay here, and the yellow face won't see me.'
`we should be glad to see the sun;' said frodo, `but we will stay here: we are too tired to go any further at present.'
`you are not wise to be glad of the yellow face,' said gollum. `it shows you up. nice sensible hobbits stay with sméagol. orcs and nasty thin

gs are about. they can see a long way. stay and hide with me! '
the three of them settled down to rest at the foot of the rocky wall of the gully. it was not much more than a tall man's height now, and at its base there were wide flat shelves of dry stone; the water ran in a channel on the other side. frodo and sam sat on one of the flats, resting their backs. gollum paddled and scrabbled in the stream.
`we must take a little food,' said frodo. `are you hungry, sméagol? we have very little to share, but we will spare you what we can.'
at the word hungry a greenish light was kindled in gollum's pale eyes, and they seemed to protrude further than ever from his thin sickly face. for a moment he relapsed into his old gollum-manner. 'we are famisshed, yes famisshed we are. precious,' he said. `what is it they eats? have they nice fisshes? ' his tongue lolled out

 between his sharp yellow teeth. licking his colourless lips.
`no, we have got no fish,' said frodo. `we have only got this' - he held up a wafer of lembas - 'and water, if the water here is fit to drink.'
`yess, yess, nice water,' said gollum. `drink it, drink it, while we can! but what is it they've got, precious? is it crunchable? is it tasty? '
frodo broke off a portion of a wafer and handed it to him on its leaf-wrapping. gollum sniffed at the leaf and his face changed: a spasm of disgust came over it, and a hint of his old malice. `sméagol smells it! ' he said. `leaves out of the elf-country, gah! they stinks. he climbed in those trees, and he couldn't wash the smell off his hands, my nice hands.' dropping the leaf, he took a corner of the lembas and nibbled it. he spat, and a fit of coughing shook him.
`ach! no! ' he spluttered. `you try to choke poor sméagol. dust and ashes, he can't eat that. he must starve. but s

nice hobbits! sméagol has promised. he will starve. he can't eat hobbits' food. he will starve. poor thin sméagol! '
`i'm sorry,' said frodo; `but i can't help you, i'm afraid. i think this food would do you good, if you would try. but perhaps you can't even try, not yet anyway.'
the hobbits munched their lembas in silence. sam thought that it tasted far better, somehow, than it had for a good while: gollum's behaviour had made him attend to its flavour again. but he did not feel comfortable. gollum watched every morsel from hand to mouth, like an expectant dog by a diner's chair. only when they had finished and were preparing to rest, was he apparently convinced that they had no hidden dainties that he could share in. then he went and sat by himself a few paces away and whimpered a little.
'look here! ' sam whispered to frodo, not too softly: he did not really care whether gollum heard him or not. `we've got to get some sleep; but not both together with that hungry villain nigh, promise or

an't keep my eyelids propped up. turn and about, same as before, while he's loose.'
'perhaps you're right, sam,' said frodo speaking openly. 'there is a change in him, but just what kind of a change and how deep, i'm not sure yet. seriously though, i don't think there is any need for fear - at present. still watch if you wish. give me about two hours, not more, and then call me.'
so tired was frodo that his head fell forward on his breast and he slept. almost as soon as he had spoken the words. gollum seemed no longer to have any fears. he curled up and went quickly to sleep, quite unconcerned. presently his breath was hissing softly through his clenched teeth, hut he lay still as stone. after a while, fearing that he would drop off himself, if he sat listening to his two companions breathing, sam got up and gently prodded gollum. his hands uncurled and twitched, but he made no other movement. sam bent down and said fissh close to his ear, but there was no response, not even a catch in gollum

 muttered. `and if i was like gollum, he wouldn't wake up never again.' he restrained the thoughts of his sword and the rope that sprang to his mind, and went and sat down by his master.
when he woke up the sky above was dim, not lighter but darker than when they had breakfasted. sam leapt to his feet. not least from his own feeling of vigour and hunger, he suddenly understood that he had slept the daylight away, nine hours at least. frodo was still fast asleep, lying now stretched on his side. gollum was not to be seen. various reproachful names for himself came to sam's mind, drawn from the gaffer's large paternal word-hoard; then it also occurred to him that his master had been right: there had for the present been nothing to guard against. they were at any rate both alive and unthrottled.
'poor wretch! ' he said half remorsefully. 'now i wonder where he's got to? '
'not far, not far! ' said a voice above him. he looked up and saw the shape of gollum's large head and ears against the eveni

ng sky.
'here, what are you doing? ' cried sam, his suspicions coming back as soon as he saw that shape.
`sméagol is hungry,' said gollum. `be back soon.'
'come back now!' shouted sam. 'hi! come back!' but gollum had vanished.
frodo woke at the sound of sam's shout and sat up, rubbing his eyes. 'hullo!' he said. 'anything wrong? what's the time?'
'i dunno,' said sam. 'after sundown, i reckon. and he's gone off. says he's hungry.'
`don't worry!' said frodo. `there's no help for it. but he'll come back, you'll see. the promise will hold yet a while. and he won't leave his precious, anyway.'
frodo made light of it when he learned that they had slept soundly for hours with gollum, and a very hungry gollum to

sam nodded silently. he took his master's hand and bent over it. he did not kiss it, though his tears fell on it. then he turned away, drew his sleeve over his nose, and got up, and stamped about, trying to whistle, and saying between the efforts: 'where's that dratted creature?'
it was actually not long before gollum returned; but he came so quietly that they did not hear him till he stood before them. his fingers and face were soiled with black mud. he was still chewing and slavering. what he was chewing, they did not ask or like to think.
'worms or beetles or something slimy out of holes,' thought sam. 'brr! the nasty creature; the poor wretch! '
gollum said nothing to them, until he had drunk deeply and washed himself in the stream. then he came up to them, licking his lips. 'better now,' he said. `are we

`no need, no need at all,' said gollum. 'not if hobbits want to reach the dark mountains and go to see him very quick. back a little, and round a little' - his skinny arm waved north and east - `and you can come on hard cold roads to the very gates of his country. lots of his people will be there looking out for guests, very pleased to take them straight to him, o yes. his eye watches that way all the time. it caught sméagol there, long ago.' gollum shuddered. 'but sméagol has used his eyes since then, yes, yes: i've used eyes and feet and nose since then. l know other ways. more difficult, not so quick; but better, if we don't want him to see. follow sméagol! he can take you through the marshes, through the mists. nice thick mists. follow sméagol very carefully, and you may go a long way. quite a long way, before he catches you, yes perhaps.'
it was already day, a windless and sullen morning, and the marsh-reeks lay in heavy banks. no s

un pierced the low clouded sky, and gollum seemed anxious to continue the journey at once. so after a brief rest they set out again and were soon lost in a shadowy silent world, cut off from all view of the lands about, either the hills that they had left or the mountains that they sought. they went slowly in single file: gollum, sam, frodo.
frodo seemed the most weary of the three, and slow though they went. he often lagged. the hobbits soon found that what had looked like one vast fen was really an endless network of pools, and soft mi

 waters. dead grasses and rotting reeds loomed up in the mists like ragged shadows of long-forgotten summers.
as the day wore on the light increased a little, and the mists lifted, growing thinner and more transparent. far above the rot and vapours of the world the sun was riding high and golden now in a serene country with floors of dazzling foam, but only a passing ghost of her could they see below, bleared, pale, giving no colour and no warmth. but even at this faint reminder of her presence gollum scowled and flinched. he halted their journey, and they rested, squatting like little hunted animals, in the borders of a great brown reed-thicket. there was a deep silence, only scraped on its surfaces by the faint quiver of empty seed-plumes, and broken grass-blades trembling in small air-movements that they could not feel.
'not a bird! ' said sam mournfully.
`no, no birds,' said gollum. `nice birds! ' he licked his teeth. 'no birds here. there are snakeses, wormses, things in the pools. lots

 with distaste.
so passed the third day of their journey with gollum. before the shadows of evening were long in happier lands, they went on again, always on and on with only brief halts. these they made not so much for rest as to help gollum; for now even he had to go forward with great care, and he was sometimes at a loss for a while. they had come to the very midst of the dead marshes, and it was dark.
they walked slowly, stooping, keeping close in line, following attentively every move that gollum made. the fens grew more wet, opening into wide stagnant meres, among which it grew more and more difficult to find the firmer places where feet could tread without sinking into gurgling mud. the travellers were light, or maybe none of them would ever have found a way through.
presently it grew altogether dark: the air itself seemed black and heavy to breathe. when lights appeared sam rubbed his eyes: he thought his head was going queer. he first saw one with the corner of his left eye, a wisp o

f pale sheen that faded away; but others appeared soon after: some like dimly shining smoke, some like misty flames flickering slowly above unseen candles; here and there they twisted like ghostly sheets unfurled by hidden hands. but neither of his companions spoke a word.
at last sam could bear it no longer. `what's all this, gollum? ' he said in a whisper. `these lights? they're all round us now. are we trapped? who are they? '
gollum looked up. a dark water was before him, and he was crawling on the ground, this way and that, doubtful of the way. 'yes, they are all round us,' he whispered. 'the tricksy lights. candles of corpses, yes, yes. don't you heed them! don't look! don't follow them! where's the master? '
sam looked back and found that frodo had lagged again. he could not see him. he went some paces back into the darkness, not daring to move far, or to call in more than a hoarse whisper. suddenly he stumbled against f

rodo, who was standing lost in thought, looking at the pale lights. his hands hung stiff at his sides; water and slime were dripping from them.
`come, mr. frodo! ' said sam. 'don't look at them! gollum says we mustn't. let's keep up with him and get out of this cursed place as quick as we can - if we can! '
`all right,' said frodo, as if returning out of a dream. 'i'm coming. go on! '
hurrying forward again, sam tripped, catching his foot in some old root or tussock. he fell and came heavily on his hands, which sank deep into sticky ooze, so that his face was brought close to the surface of the dark mere. there was a faint hiss, a noisome smell went up, the lights flickered and danced and swir

led. for a moment the water below him looked like some window, glazed with grimy glass, through which he was peering. wrenching his hands out of the bog, he sprang back with a cry. 'there are dead things, dead faces in the water,' he said with horror. 'dead faces! '
gollum laughed. 'the dead marshes, yes, yes: that is their names,' he cackled. `you should not look in when the candles are lit.'
`who are they? what are they? ' asked sam shuddering, turning to frodo, who was now behind him.
'i don't know,' said frodo in a dreamlike voice. 'but i have seen them too. in the pools when the candles were lit. they lie in all the pools, pale faces, deep deep under the dark water. i saw them: grim faces and evil, and noble faces and sad. many faces proud and fair, and weeds

precious little gollums in a row we shall be, if this goes on much longer,' thought sam.
at last they came to the end of the black mere, and they crossed it, perilously, crawling or hopping from one treacherous island tussock to another. often they floundered, stepping or falling hands-first into waters as noisome as a cesspool, till they were slimed and fouled almost up to their necks and stank in one another's nostrils.
it was late in the night when at length they reached firmer ground again. gollum hissed and whispered to himself, but it appeared that he was pleased: in some mysterious way, by some blended sense of feel, and smell, and uncanny memory for shapes in the dark, he seemed to know just where he was again, and to be sure of his road ahead.
`now on we go! ' he said. 'nice hobbits! brave hobbits! very very weary, of course; so we are, my precious, all of us. but we must take master away from the wicked lights, yes, yes, we must.' with these words he started off again, almost at a t

stward and southward. for some time the hobbits could not hear or feel what was troubling him. then suddenly all three halted, stiffening and listening. to frodo and sam it seemed that they heard, far away, a long wailing cry, high and thin and cruel. they shivered. at the same moment the stirring of the air became perceptible to them; and it grew very cold. as they stood straining their ears, they heard a noise like a wind coming in the distance. the misty lights wavered, dimmed, and went out.
gollum would not move. he stood shaking and gibbering to himself, until with a rush the wind came upon them, hissing and snarling over the marshes. the night became less dark, light enough for them to see, or half see, shapeless drifts of fog, curling and twisting as it rolled over them and passed them. looking up they saw the clouds breaking and shredding; and then high in the south the moon glimmered out, riding in the flying wrack.
for a moment the sight of it gladdened the hearts of the hobbits; bu

t gollum cowered down, muttering curses on the white face. then frodo and sam staring at the sky, breathing deeply of the fresher air, saw it come: a small cloud flying from the accursed hills; a black shadow loosed from mordor; a vast shape winged and ominous. it scudded across the moon, and with a deadly cry went away westward, outrunning the wind in its fell speed.
they fell forward, grovelling heedlessly on the cold earth. but the shadow of horror wheeled and returned, passing lower now, right above

them, sweeping the fen-reek with its ghastly wings. and then it was gone, flying back to mordor with the speed of the wrath of sauron; and behind it the wind roared away, leaving the dead marshes bare and bleak. the naked waste, as far as the eye could pierce, even to the distant menace of the mountains, was dappled with the fitful moonlight.
frodo and sam got up, rubbing their eyes, like children wakened from an evil dream to find the familiar night still over the world. but gollum lay on the ground as if he had been stunned. they roused him with difficulty, and for some time he would not lift his face, but knelt forward on his elbows, covering the back of his head with his large flat hands.
`wraiths!' he wailed. `wraiths on wings! the precious is their master. they see everything, everything. nothing can hide from them. curse the white face! and they tell him everything. he sees, he knows. ach, gollum, gollum, gollum! ' it was not until the moon had sunk, westering far be

yond tol brandir, that he would get up or make a move.
from that time on sam thought that he sensed a change in gollum again. he was more fawning and would-be friendly; but sam surprised some strange looks in his eyes at times, especially towards frodo; and he went back more and more into his old manner of speaking. and sam had another growing anxiety. frodo seemed to be weary, weary to the point of exhaustion. he said nothing. indeed he hardly spoke at all; and he did not complain, but he walked like one who carries a load, the weight of which is ever increasing; and he dragged along, slower and slower, so that

 sam had often to beg gollum to wait and not to leave their master behind.
in fact with every step towards the gates of mordor frodo felt the ring on its chain about his neck grow more burdensome. he was now beginning to feel it as an actual weight dragging him earthwards. but far more he was troubled by the eye: so he called it to himself. it was that more than the drag of the ring that made him cower and stoop as he walked. the eye: that horrible growing sense of a hostile will that strove with great power to pierce all s

hadows of cloud, and earth, and flesh, and to see you: to pin you under its deadly gaze, naked, immovable. so thin, so frail and thin, the veils were become that still warded it off. frodo knew just where the present habitation and heart of that will now was: as certainly as a man can tell the direction of the sun with his eyes shut. he was facing it, and its potency beat upon his brow.
gollum probably felt something of the same sort. but what went on in his wretched heart between the pressure of the eye, and the lust of the ring that was so near, and his grovelling promise made half in the fear of cold iron, the hobbits did not guess: frodo gave no thought to it. sam's mind was occupied mostly with his master hardly noticing the dark cloud that had fallen on his own heart. he put frodo in front of him now, and kept a watchful eye on every movement of his, supporting him if he stumble

the sun was up, walking among clouds and long flags of smoke, but even the sunlight was defiled. the hobbits had no welcome for that light; unfriendly it seemed, revealing them in their helplessness - little squeaking ghosts that wandered among the ash-heaps of the dark lord.
too weary to go further they sought for some place where they could rest. for a while they sat without speaking under the shadow of a mound of slag; but foul fumes leaked out of it, catching their throats and choking them. gollum was the first to get up. spluttering and cursing he rose, and without a word or a glance at the hobbits he crawled away on all fours. frodo and sam crawled after him, until they came to a wide almost circular pit, high-banked upon the west. it was cold and dead, and a foul sump of oily many-coloured ooze lay at its bottom. in this evil hole they cowered, hoping in its shadow to escape the attention of the eye.
the day passed slowly. a great thirst troubled them, but they drank only a few drops f

be on guard. he lay back on the slope of the pit, but that did not ease the sense of burden that was on him. he looked up at the smoke-streaked sky and saw strange phantoms, dark riding shapes, and faces out of the past. he lost count of time, hovering between sleep and waking, until forgetfulness came over him.
suddenly sam woke up thinking that he heard his master calling. it was evening. frodo could not have called, for he had fallen asleep, and had slid down nearly to the bottom of the pit. gollum was by him. for a moment sam thought that he was trying to rouse frodo; then he saw that it was not so. gollum was talking to himself. sméagol was holding a debate with some other thought that used the same voice but made it squeak and hiss. a pale light and a green light alternated in his eyes as he spoke.
`sméagol promised,' said the first thought.
`yes, yes, my precious,' came the answer, 'we promised: to save our precious, not to let him have it - never. but it's going to him yes, nearer e

'no, not this baggins.'
'yes, every baggins. all peoples that keep the precious. we must have it! '
`but he'll see, he'll know. he'll take it from us! '
'he sees. he knows. he heard us make silly promises - against his orders, yes. must take it. the wraiths are searching. must take it.'
'not for him! '
'no, sweet one. see, my precious: if we has it, then we can escape, even from him, eh? perhaps we grows very strong, stronger than wraiths. lord sméagol? gollum the great? the gollum! eat fish every day, three times a day; fresh from the sea. most precious gollum! must have it. we wants it, we wants it, we wants it! '
'but there's two of them. they'll wake too quick and kill us,' whined sméagol in a last effort. `not now. not yet.'
'we wants it! but' - and here there was a long pause, as if a new thought had wakened. `not yet, eh? perhaps not. she might help. she might, yes.'
`no, no! not that way! ' wailed sméagol.
`yes! we wants it! we wants it! '
e

ach time that the second thought spoke, gollum's long hand crept out slowly, pawing towards frodo, and then was drawn back with a jerk as sméagol spoke again. finally both arms, with long fingers flexed and twitching, clawed towards his neck.
sam had lain still, fascinated by this debate, but watching every move that gollum made from under his half-closed eye-lids. to his simple mind ordinary hunger, the desire to eat hobbits, had seemed the chief danger in gollum. he realized now that it was not so: gollum was feeling the terrible call of the ring. the dark lord was he, of course; but sam wondered who she was. one of the nasty friends the little wretch had made in his wanderings, he supposed. then he forgot the point, for things had plainly gone far enough, and were getting dangerous. a great heaviness was in all

his limbs, but he roused himself with an effort and sat up. something warned him to be careful and not to reveal that he had overheard the debate. he let out a loud sigh and gave a huge yawn.
`what's the time? ' he said sleepily.
gollum sent out a long hiss through his teeth. he stood up for a moment, tense and menacing; and then he collapsed, falling forward on to all fours and crawling up the bank of the pit. 'nice hobbits! nice sam! ' he said. 'sleepy heads, yes, sleepy heads! leave good sméagol to watch! but it's evening. dusk is creeping. time to go.'
`high time! ' thought sam. 'and time we parted, too.' yet it crossed his mind to wonder if indeed gollum was not now as dangerous turned loose as kept with them. 'curse him!
 
 ___________________________
 
 i wish he was choked!' he muttered. he stumbled down the bank and roused his master.
strangely enough, frodo felt refreshed. he had been dreaming. the dark shadow had passed, and a fair vision had visited him in this land of disease. nothing remained of it in his memory, yet because of it he felt glad and lighter of heart. his burden was less heavy on him. gollum welcomed him with dog-like delight. he chuckled and chattered, cracking his long fingers, and pawing at frodo's knees. frodo smiled at him.
'come! ' he said. `you have guided us well and faithfully. this is the last stage. bring us to the gate, and then i will not ask you to go further. bring us to the gate, and you may go where you wish - only not to our enemies.'
'to the gate, eh?' gollum squeaked, seeming surprised and frightened. 'to the gate, master says! yes, he says so. and good sméagol 
 
 ___________________________
 
 no!'
'go on with you! ' said sam. `let's get it over! '
in the falling dusk they scrambled out of the pit and slowly threaded their way through the dead land. they had not gone far before they felt once more the fear that had fallen on them when the winged shape swept over the marshes. they halted, cowering on the evil-smelling ground; but they saw nothing in the gloomy evening sky above, and soon the menace passed, high overhead, going maybe on some swift errand from barad-dûr. after a while gollum got up and crept forward again, muttering and shaking.
about an hour after midnight the fear fell on them a third time, but it now seemed more remote, as if it were passing far above the clouds, rushing with terrible speed into the west. gollum, however, was helpless with terror, and was convinced that they were being hunted, that their approach was known.
`three times! ' he whimpered. 'three times is a threat. they feel us here, they feel the precious. the precious is their master. we cannot go
 
 ___________________________
 
 any further this way, no. it's no use, no use! '
pleading and kind words were no longer of any avail. it was not until frodo commanded him angrily and laid a hand on his sword-hilt that gollum would get up again. then at last he rose with a snarl, and went before them like a beaten dog.
so they stumbled on through the weary end of the night, and until the coming of another day of fear they walked in silence with bowed heads, seeing nothing, and hearing nothing but the wind hissing in their ears.

nd he would still stick to him. his master would not go to mordor alone. sam would go with him-and at any rate they would get rid of gollum.
gollum, however, did not intend to be got rid of, yet. he knelt at frodo's feet, wringing his hands and squeaking. 'not this way, master! ' he pleaded, 'there is another way. o yes indeed there is. another way. darker, more difficult to find, more secret. but sméagol knows it. let sméagol show you! '
'another way! ' said frodo doubtfully, looking down at gollum with searching eyes.
'yess! yess indeed! there was another way. sméagol found it. let's go and see if it's still there! '
`you have not spoken of this before.'
`no. master did not ask. master did not say what he meant to do. he does not tell poor sméagol. he says: sméagol, take me to the gate - and then good bye! sméagol can run away and be good. but now he says: i purpose to enter mordor this way. so sméagol is very afraid. he does not want to lose nice master. and he promised, master made

 him promise, to save the precious. but master is going to take it to him, straight to the black hand, if master will go this way. so sméagol must save them both, and he thinks of another way that there was, once upon a time. nice master. sméagol very good, always helps.'
sam frowned. if he could have bored holes in gollum with his eyes, he would have done. his mind was full of doubt. to all appearances gollum was genuinely distressed and anxious to help frodo. but sam, remembering the overheard debate, found it hard to believe that the long submerged sméagol had come out on top: that voice at any rate had not had the last word in the debate. sam's guess was that the sméagol and gollum halves (or what in his own mind he called slinker and stinker) had made a truce and a temporary alliance: neither wanted the enemy to get the ring; both wished to keep frodo from capture, and under their eye, as long 
 
 ___________________________
 
to his precious for good and all, there'd be trouble pretty quick, i bet. anyhow old stinker is so frightened of the enemy - and he's under orders of some kind from him, or was - that he'd give us away rather than be caught helping us; and rather than let his precious be melted, maybe. at least that's my idea. and i hope the master will think it out carefully. he's as wise as any, but he's soft-hearted, that's what he is. it's beyond any gamgee to guess what he'll do next.'
frodo did not answer gollum at once. while these doubts were passing through sam's slow but shrewd mind, he stood gazing out towards the dark cliff of cirith gorgor. the hollow in which they had taken refuge was delved in the side of a low hill, at some little height above a long trenchlike valley that lay between it and the outer buttresses of the mountains. in the midst of the valley stood the black foundations of the western watch-tower. by morning-light the roads that converged upon the gate of mordor could now be clea

 my command. so have a care, sméagol!'
sam looked at his master with approval, but also with surprise: there was a look in his face and a tone in his voice that he had not known before. it had always been a notion of his that the kindness of dear mr. frodo was of such a high degree that it must imply a fair measure of blindness. of course, he also firmly held the incompatible belief that mr. frodo was the wisest person in the world (with the possible exception of old mr. bilbo and of gandalf). gollum in his own way, and with much more excuse as his acquaintance was much briefer, may have _made a similar mistake, confusing kindness and blindness. at any rate this speech abashed and terrified him. he grovelled on the ground and could speak no clear words but nice master.
frodo waited patiently for a while, then he spoke again less sternly. `come now, gollum or sméagol if you wish, tell me of this other way, and show me, if you can, what hope there is in it, enough to justify me in turning asi

but gollum was in a pitiable state, and frodo's threat had quite unnerved him. it was not easy to get any clear account out of him, amid his mumblings and squeakings, and the frequent interruptions in which he crawled on the floor and begged them both to be kind to `poor little sméagol'. after a while he grew a little calmer, and frodo gathered bit by bit that, if a traveller followed the road that turned west of ephel dúath, he would come in time to a crossing in a circle of dark trees. on the right a r

 the black rock, you'll see it. suddenly you'll see it above you, and you'll want to hide.'
`see it, see it? what will you see? '
`the old fortress, very old, very horrible now. we used to hear tales from the south, when sméagol was young, long ago. o yes. we used to tell lots of tales in the evening, sitting by the banks of the great river, in the willow-lands, when the river was younger too, gollum, gollum.' he began to weep and mutter. the hobbits waited patiently.
`tales out of the south,' gollum went on again, `about the tall men with the shining eyes, and their houses like hills of stone, and the silver crown of their king and his white tree: wonderful tales. they built very tall towers, and one they raised was silver-white, and in it there was a stone like the moon, and round it were great white walls. o yes, there were many tales about the tower of the moon.'
`that would be minas ithil that isildur the son of elendil built ' said frodo. `it was isildur who cut off the finger of the e

nemy.'
`yes, he has only four on the black hand, but they are enough,' said gollum shuddering. 'and he hated isildur's city.'
'what does he not hate? ' said frodo. 'but what has the tower of the moon to do with us? '
'well, master, there it was and there it is: the tall tower and the white houses and the wall; but not nice now, not beautiful. he conquered it long ago. it is a very terrible place now. travellers shiver when they see it, they creep out of sight, they avoid its shadow. but master will have to go that way. that is the only other way, for the mountains are lower th

we might as well do it here, and save ourselves a long tramp.'
'don't make jokes about it,' hissed gollum. `it isn't funny, o no! not amusing. it's nut sense to try and get into mordor at all. but if master says i must go or i will go, then he must try some way. but he must not go to the terrible city, o no, of course not. that is where sméagol helps. nice sméagol. though no one tells him what it is all about. sméagol helps again. he found it. he knows it.'
'what did you find? ' asked frodo.
gollum crouched down and his voice sank to a whisper again. 'a little path leading up into the mountains: and then a stair, a narrow stair, o yes, very long and narrow. and then more stairs. and then' - his voice sank even lower - `a tunnel, a dark tunnel; and at last a little cleft, and a path high above the main pass. it was that way that sméagol got out of the darkness. but it was years ago. the path may have vanished now; but perhaps not, perhaps not.'
`i don't like the sound of it at all,' said s
 
 ___________________________
 
am. `sounds too easy at any rate in the telling. if that path is still there, it'll be guarded too. wasn't it guarded, gollum? ' as he said this, he caught or fancied he caught a green gleam in gollum's eye. gollum muttered but did not reply.
'is it not guarded? ' asked frodo sternly. `and did you escape out of the darkness, sméagol? were you not rather permitted to depart upon an errand? that at least is w hat aragorn thought, who found you by the dead marshes some years ago.'
'it's a lie! ' hissed gollum, and an evil light came into his eyes at the naming of aragorn. `he lied on me, yes he did. i did escape, all by my poor self. indeed i was told to seek for the precious; and i have searched and searche
 
 ___________________________
 
d, of course i have. but not for the black one. the precious was ours, it was mine i tell you. i did escape.'
frodo felt a strange certainty that in this matter gollum was for once not so far from the truth as might be suspected; that he had somehow found a way out of mordor, and at least believed that it was by his own cunning. for one thing, he noted that gollum used i, and that seemed usually to be a sign, on its rare appearances. that some remnants of old truth and sincerity were for the moment on top. but even if gollum could be trusted on this point, frodo did not forget the wiles of the enemy. the 'escape' may have been allowed or arranged, and well known in the dark tower. and in any case gollum was plainly keeping a good deal back.
'i ask you again,' he said: `is not this secret way guarded? '
but the name of aragorn had put gollum into a sullen

mood. he had all the injured air of a liar suspected when for once he has told the truth. or part of it. he did not answer.
'is it not guarded? ' frodo repeated.
`yes, yes, perhaps. no safe places in this country,' said gollum sulkily. 'no safe places. but master must try it or go home. . no other way.' they could not get him to say more. the name of the perilous place and the high pass he could not tell, or would not.
its name was cirith ungol, a name of dreadful rumour. aragorn could perhaps have told them that name and its significance: gandalf would have warned them. but they were alone, and aragorn was far away, and gandalf stood amid the ruin of isengard and strove with saruman, delayed by treason. yet even as h

new, somehow, that they were huge, with a vast stretch of pinion, flying at a great height. he covered his eyes and bent forward, cowering. the same warning fear was on him as he had felt in the presence of the black riders, the helpless horror that had come with the cry in the wind and the shadow on the moon, though now it was not so crushing or compelling: the menace was more remote. but menace it was. frodo felt it too. his thought was broken. he stirred and shivered, but he did not look up. gollum huddled himself together like a cornered spider. the winged shapes wheeled, and stooped swiftly down, speeding back to mordor.
sam took a deep breath. `the riders are about again, up in the air,' he said in a hoarse whisper. 'i saw them. do you think they could see us? they were very high up. and if they are black riders same as before, then they can't see much by daylight, can they? '
'no, perhaps not,' said frodo. `but their steeds could see. and these winged creatures that they ride on now, t

hey can probably see more than any other creature. they are like great carrion birds. they are looking for something: the enemy is on the watch, i fear.'
the feeling of dread passed, but the enfolding silence was broken. for some time they had been cut off from the world, as if in an invisible island; now they were laid bare again, peril had returned. but still frodo did not speak to gollum or make his choice. his eyes were closed, as if he were dreaming, or looking inward into his heart and memory. at last he stirred and stood up, and it seemed that he was about to speak and to decide. but `hark!' he said. `what is that?'
a new fear was upon them. they heard singing and hoarse shouting. at first it seemed a long way off, but it drew nearer: it was coming towards them. it leaped into all their minds that the black wings had spied them and had sent armed soldiers to seize them: no s

peed seemed too great for these terrible servants of sauron. they crouched, listening. the voices and the clink of weapons and harness were very close. frodo and sam loosened their small swords in their sheaths. flight was impossible.
gollum rose slowly and crawled insect-like to the lip of the hollow. very cautiously he raised himself inch by inch, until he could peer over it between two broken points of stone. he remained there without moving for some time, making no sound. presently the voices began to recede again, and then they slowly faded away. far off a horn blew on the ramparts of the morannon. then quietly gollum drew back and slipped down into the hollow.
'more men going to mordor,' he said in a low voice. `dark faces. we

" for if there was, i was going to take a look, risk or no. but now i don't suppose i'll ever see an oliphaunt. maybe there ain't no such a beast.' he sighed.
`no, no oliphaunts,' said gollum again. 'sméagol has not heard of them. he does not want to see them. he does not want them to be. sméagol wants to go away from here and hide somewhere safer. sméagol wants master to go. nice master, won't he come with sméagol? '
frodo stood up. he had laughed in the midst of all his cares when sam trotted out the old fireside rhyme of oliphaunt, and the laugh had released him from hesitation. `i wish we had a thousand oliphaunts with gandalf on a white one at their head,' he said. `then we'

`soon get more now,' he said, licking his lips. `good water runs down in streams to the great river, nice water in the lands we are going to. sméagol will get food there too, perhaps. he's very hungry, yes, gollum!' he set his two large flat hands on his shrunken belly, and a pale green light came into his eyes.
the dusk was deep when at length they set out, creeping over the westward rim of the dell, and fading like ghosts into the broken country on t

t they did not forget their danger, nor the black gate that was still all too near, hidden though it was behind the gloomy heights. they looked about for a hiding-place where they could shelter from evil eyes while the light lasted.
the day passed uneasily. they lay deep in the heather and counted out the slow hours, in which there seemed little change; for they were still under the shadows of the ephel dúath, and the sun was veiled. frodo slept at times, deeply and peacefully, either trusting gollum or too tired to trouble about him; but sam found it difficult to do more than doze, even when gollum was plainly fast asleep, whiffling and twitching in his secret dreams. hunger, perhaps, more than mistrust kept him wakeful: he had begun to long for a good homely meal, `something hot out of the pot'.
as soon as the land faded into a formless grey under coming night, they started out again. in a little while gollum led them down on to the southward road; and after that they went on more quickly,

so they passed into the northern marches of that land that men once called ithilien, a fair country of climbing woods and swift-falling streams. the night became fine under star and round moon, and it seemed to the hobbits that the fragrance of the air grew as they went forward; and from the blowing and muttering of gollum it seemed that he noticed it too, and did not relish it. at the first signs of day they halted again. they had come to the end of a long cutting, deep, and sheer-sided in the middle, by which the road clove its way through a stony ridge. now they climbed up the westward bank and looked abroad.
day was opening in the sky, and they saw that the mountains were now much further off, receding eastward in a long curve that was lost in the distance. before them, as they turned west, gentle slopes ran d

the travellers turned their backs on the road and went downhill. as they walked, brushing their way through bush and herb, sweet odours rose about them. gollum coughed and retched; but the hobbits breathed deep, and suddenly sam laughed, for heart's ease not for jest. they followed a stream that went quickly down before them. presently it brought them to a small clear lake in a shallow dell: it lay in the broken ruins of an ancient stone basin, the carven rim of which was almost wholly covered with mosses and rose-brambles; iris-swords stood in ranks about it. and water-lily leaves floated on its dark gently-rippling surface; but it was deep and fresh,

 worse times ahead. six days or more had passed since he reckoned that they had only a bare supply for three weeks.
'if we reach the fire in that time, we'll be lucky at this rate! ' he thought. `and we might be wanting to get back. we might! '
besides, at the end of a long night-march, and after bathing and drinking, he felt even more hungry than usual. a supper, or a breakfast, by the fire in the old kitchen at bagshot row was what he really wanted. an idea struck him and he turned to gollum. gollum had just begun to sneak off on his own, and he was crawling away on all fours through the fern.
`hi! gollum! ' said sam. `where are you going? hunting? well see here, old noser, you don't like our food, and i'd not be sorry for a change myself. your new motto's always ready to help. could you find anything fit for a hungry hobbit? '
`yes, perhaps, yes,' said gollum. `sméagol always helps, if they asks - if they asks nicely.'
`right!' said sam `i does ask. and if that isn't nice enough, i begs.'

gollum disappeared. he was away some time, and frodo after a few mouthfuls of lembas settled deep into the brown fern and went to sleep. sam looked at him. the early daylight was only just creeping down into the shadows under the trees, but he saw his master's face very clearly, and his hands, too, lying at rest on the ground beside him. he was reminded suddenly of frodo as he had lain, asleep in the house of elrond, after his deadly wound. then as he had kept watch sam had noticed that at times a ligh

ven clearer and stronger. frodo's face was peaceful, the marks of fear and care had left it; but it looked old, old and beautiful, as if the chiselling of the shaping years was now revealed in many fine lines that had before been hidden, though the identity of the face was not changed. not that sam gamgee put it that way to himself. he shook his head, as if finding words useless, and murmured: `i love him. he's like that, and sometimes it shines through, somehow. but i love him, whether or no.'
gollum returned quietly and peered over sam's shoulder. looking at frodo, he shut his eyes and crawled away without a sound. sam came to him a moment later and found him chewing something and muttering to himself. on the ground beside him lay two small rabbits, which he was beginning to eye greedily.
'sméagol always helps,' he said. `he has brought rabbits, nice rabbits. but master has gone to sleep, and perhaps sam wants to sleep. doesn't want rabbits now? sméagol tries to help, but he can't catch t

going to leave frodo alone asleep even for a few minutes.
'now, gollum,' he said, 'i've another job for you. go and fill these pans with water, and bring 'em back! '
'sméagol will fetch water, yes,' said gollum. 'but what does the hobbit want all that water for? he has drunk, he has washed.'
'never you mind,' said sam. `if you can't guess, you'll soon find out. and the sooner you fetch the water, the sooner you'll learn. don't you damage one of my pans, or i'll carve you into mincemeat.'
while gollum was away sam took another look at frodo. he was still sleeping quietly, but sam was now struck most by the leanness of his face and hands. 'too thin and drawn he is,' he muttered. 'not right for a hobbit. if i can get these coneys cooked, i'm going to wake him up.'
sam gathered a pile of the driest fern, and then scrambled up the bank collecting a bundle of twigs and broken wood; the fallen branch of a cedar at the top gave him a good supply. he cut out some turves at the foot of the bank just o

utside the fern-brake, and made a shallow hole and laid his fuel in it. being handy with flint and tinder he soon had a small blaze going. it made little or no smoke but gave off an aromatic scent. he was just stooping over his fire, shielding it and building it up with heavier wood, when gollum returned, carrying the pans carefully and grumbling to himself.
he set the pans down, and then suddenly saw what sam was doing. he gave a thin hissing shriek, and seemed to be both frightened and angry. `ach! sss - no!' he cried. `no! silly hobbits, foolish, yes foolish! they mustn't do it!'
`mustn't do what?' asked sam in surprise.
`not make the nassty red tongues,' hissed gollum. `fire, fire! it's dangerous, yes it is. it burns, it kills. and it will bring enemies, yes it will.'
'i don't think

 so,' said sam. `don't see why it should, if you don't put wet stuff on it and make a smother. but if it does, it does. i'm going to risk it, anyhow. i'm going to stew these coneys.'
'stew the rabbits!' squealed gollum in dismay. `spoil beautiful meat sméagol saved for you, poor hungry sméagol! what for? what for, silly hobbit? they are young, they are tender, they are nice. eat them, eat them!' he clawed at the nearest rabbit, already skinned and lying by the fire.
`now, now! ' said sam. `each to his own fashion. our bread chokes you, and raw coney chokes me. if you give me a coney, the coney's mine, see, to cook, if i have a mind. and i have. you needn't watch me. go and catch another and eat it as you fan

gollum withdrew grumbling, and crawled into the fern. sam busied himself with his pans. `what a hobbit needs with coney,' he said to himself, `is some herbs and roots, especially taters - not to mention bread. herbs we can manage, seemingly.'
`gollum!' he called softly. `third time pays for all. i want some herbs.' gollum's head peeped out of the fern, but his looks were neither helpful nor friendly. `a few bay-leaves, some thyme and sage, will do - before the water boils,' said sam.
`no! ' said gollum

en hobbit-eyes he saw that many more men were about. he could see them stealing up the slopes, singly or in long files, keeping always to the shade of grove or thicket, or crawling, hardly visible in their brown and green raiment, through grass and brake. all were hooded and masked, and had gauntlets on their hands, and were armed like faramir and his companions. before long they had all passed and vanished. the sun rose till it neared the south. the shadows shrank.
`i wonder where that dratted gollum is? ' thought sam, as he crawled back into deeper shade. `he stands a fair chance of being spitted for an orc, or of being roasted by the yellow face. but i fancy he'll look after himself.' he lay down beside frodo and began to doze.
he woke, thinking that he had heard horns blowing. he sat up. it was now high noon. the guards stood alert and tense in the shadow of the trees. suddenly the horns rang out louder and beyond mistake from above, over the top of the slope. sam thought that he heard cr

they walked on in silence for a while, passing like grey and green shadows under the old trees, their feet making no sound; above them many birds sang, and the sun glistened on the polished roof of dark leaves in the evergreen woods of ithilien.
sam had taken no part in the conversation, though he had listened; and at the same time he had attended with his keen hobbit ears to all the soft woodland noises about them. one thing he had noted, that in all the talk the name of gollum had not once come up. he was glad, though he felt that it was too much to hope that he would never hear it again. he soon became aware also that though they walked alone, there were many men close at hand: not only damrod and mablung flitting in and out of the shadows ahead, but others on either side, all making their swift secret way to some appointed place.
once, looking suddenly back, as if some prickle of the skin told him that he was watched from behind, he thought he caught a brief glimpse

so it went on, almost as unceasing as the waterfall, only interrupted by a faint noise of slavering and gurgling. frodo shivered, listening with pity and disgust. he wished it would stop, and that he never need hear that voice again. anborn was not far behind. he could creep back and ask him to get the huntsmen to shoot. they would probably get close enough, while gollum was gorging and off his guard. only one true shot, and frodo would be rid of the miserable voice for ever. but no, gollum had a claim on him now. the servant has a claim on the master for service, even service in fear. they would have foundered in the dead marshes but for gollum. frodo knew, too, somehow, quite clearly that gandalf would not have wished it.
`sméagol! ' he said softly.
`fissh, nice fissh,' said the voice.
`sméagol! ' he said, a little louder. the voice stopped.

'no!' said the voice. `not nice master. leaves poor sméagol and goes with new friends. master can wait. sméagol hasn't finished.'
`there's no time,' said frodo. `bring fish with you. come! '
`no! must finish fish.'
'sméagol! ' said frodo desperately. 'precious will be angry. i shall take precious, and i shall say: make him swallow the bones and choke. never taste fish again. come, precious is waiting! '
there was a sharp hiss. presently out of the darkness gollum came crawling on all fours, like an erring dog called to heel. he had a half-eaten fish in his mouth and another in his hand. he came close to frodo, almost nose to nose, and sniffed at him. his pale eyes were shining. then he took the fish out of his mouth and stood up.
`nice master! ' he whispered. `nice hobbit, come back to poor sméagol. good sméagol comes. now let's go, go quickly, yes. through the trees, while the faces are dark. yes, come let's go! '
`yes, we'll go soon,' said frodo. `bu

`we must trust master? ' said gollum doubtfully. 'why? why not go at once? where is the other one, the cross rude hobbit? where is he?'
'away up there,' said frodo, pointing to the waterfall. 'i am not going without him. we must go back to him.' his heart sank. this was too much like trickery. he did not really fear that faramir would allow gollum to be killed, but he would probably make him prisoner and bind him; and certainly what frodo did would seem a treachery to the poor treacherous creature. it would probably be impossible ever to make him understand or believe that frodo had saved his life in the only way he could. what else could he do? - to keep faith, as near as might be, with both sides. `come!' he said. `or the precious will be angry. we are going back now, up the stream. go on, go on, you go in front!

gollum crawled along

at that moment the great black shape of anborn loomed up behind him and came down on him. a large strong hand took him in the nape of the neck and pinned him. he twisted round like lightning, all wet and slimy as he was, wriggling like an eel, biting and scratching like a cat. but two more men came up out of the shadows.
'hold still! ' said one. `or we'll stick you as full of pins as a hedgehog. hold still!'
gollum went limp, and began to whine and weep. they tied him, none too gently.
`easy, easy! ' said frodo. `he has no strength to match you. don't hurt him, if you can help it. he'll be quieter, if you don't. sméagol! they won't hurt you. i'll go with you, and you shall come to no harm. not unless they kill me too. trust master! '
gollum turned and spat at him. the men picked him up, put a hood over his eyes, and carried him off.
frodo followed them, feeling very wretched. they went through the opening

iece of misery is.'
a man came and beckoned to the hobbits, and took them to the recess at the back of the cave. faramir was sitting there in his chair, and the lamp had been rekindled in its niche above his head. he signed to them to sit down on the stools beside him. `bring wine for the guests,' he said. `and bring the prisoner to me.'
the wine was brought, and then anborn came carrying gollum. he removed the cover from gollum's head and set him on his feet standing behind him to support him. gollum blinked, hooding the malice of his eyes with their heavy pale lids. a very miserable creature he looked, dripping and dank, smelling of fish (he still clutched one in his hand); his sparse locks were hanging like rank weed over his bony brows, his nose was snivelling.
`loose us! loose us! ' he said. `the cord hurts us, yes it does, it hurts us, and we've done nothing.'
`nothing? ' said faramir, looking at the wretched creature with a keen glance, but without any expression in his face either of

anger, or pity, or wonder. 'nothing? have you never done anything worthy of binding or of worse punishment? however, that is not for me to judge, happily. but tonight you have come where it is death to come. the fish of this pool are dearly bought.'
gollum dropped the fish from his hand. `don't want fish,' he said.
'the price is not set on the fish,' said faramir. `only to come here and look on the pool bears the penalty of death. i have spared you so far at the prayer of frodo here, who says that of him at least you have deserved some thanks. but you must also satisfy me. what is your name? whence do you come? and whither do you go? what is your business? '
`we are lost, lost,' said gollum. 'no name, no business, no precious, nothing. only empty.

 only hungry; yes, we are hungry. a few little fishes, nasty bony little fishes, for a poor creature, and they say death. so wise they are; so just, so very just.'
'not very wise,' said faramir. 'but just: yes perhaps, as just as our little wisdom allows. unloose him frodo! ' faramir took a small nail-knife from his belt and handed it to frodo. gollum misunderstanding the gesture, squealed and fell down.
'now, sméagol! ' said frodo. 'you must trust me. i will not desert you. answer truthfully, if you can. it will do you good not harm.' he cut the cords on gollum's wrists and ankles and raised him to his feet.
'come hither! ' said faramir. `look at me! do you know the name of this place? have you been here before? '
slowly gollum raised his eyes and looked unwillingly into faramir's. all light went out of them, and they stared bleak and pale

for a moment into the clear unwavering eyes of the man of gondor. there was a still silence. then gollum dropped his head and shrank down, until he was squatting on the floor, shivering. 'we doesn't know and we doesn't want to know,' he whimpered. `never came here; never come again.'
`there are locked doors and closed windows in your mind, and dark rooms behind them,' said faramir. `but in this i judge that you speak the truth. it is well for you. what oath will you swear never to return; and never to lead any living creature hither by word or sign?'
`master knows,' said gollum with a sidelong glan

deed in the shire such a matter would have required a great many more words and bows.
'then i say to you,' said faramir, turning to gollum, 'you are under doom of death; but while you walk with frodo you are safe for our part. yet if ever you be found by any man of gondor astray without him, the doom shall fall. and may death find you swiftly, within gondor or without, if you do not well serve him. now answer me: whither would you go? you were his guide, he says. whither were you leading him? ' gollum made no reply.
`this i will not have secret,' said faramir. `answer me, or i will reverse my judgement! ' still gollum did not answer.
`i will answer for him,' said frodo. `he brought me to the black gate, as i asked; but it was impassable.'
`there is no open gate into the nameless land,' said faramir.
`seeing this, we turned aside and came by the southward road ' frodo continued; 'for he said that there is, or there may be, a path near to minas ithil.'
`minas morgul,' said faramir.

`do you know the name of that high pass? ' said faramir.
'no,' said frodo.
'it is called cirith ungol.' gollum hissed sharply and began muttering to himself. `is not that its name? ' said faramir turning to him.
`no! ' said gollum, and then he squealed, as if something had stabbed him. 'yes, yes, we heard the name once. but what does the name matter to us? master says he must get in. so we must try some way. there is no other way to try, no.'
'no other way? ' said faramir. `how do you know that? and who has explored all the confines of that dark realm? ' he looked long and thoughtfully at gollum. present

ly he spoke again. `take this creature away, anborn. treat him gently, but watch him. and do not you, sméagol, try to dive into the falls. the rocks have such teeth there as would slay you before your time. leave us now and take your fish! '
anborn went out and gollum went cringing before him. the curtain was drawn across the recess.
`frodo, i think you do very unwisely in this,' said faramir. `i do not think you should go with this creature. it is wicked.'
'no, not altogether wicked,' said frodo.
'not wholly, perhaps,' said faramir; 'but malice eats it like a canker, and the evil is growing. he will lead you to no good. if you will part with him, i will give him safe-conduct and guidance to any point on the borders of gondor that he may name.'

the hobbits bowed low. `most gracious host,' said frodo, 'it was said to me by elrond halfelven that i should find friendship upon the way, secret and unlooked for. certainly i looked for no such friendship as you have shown. to have found it turns evil to great good.'
now they made ready to depart. gollum was brought out of some corner or hiding-hole, and he seemed better pleased with himself than he had been, though he kept close to frodo and avoided the glance of faramir.
'your guide must be blindfolded,' said faramir, 'but you and your servant samwise i release from this, if you wish.'
gollum squealed, and squirmed, and clutched at frodo, when they came to bind his eyes; and frodo said: 'blindfold us all three, and cover up my eyes first, and then perhaps he will see that no harm is meant.' th

heir foreheads. 'go with the good will of all good men!' he said.
they bowed to the ground. then he turned and without looking back he left them and went to his two guards that stood at a little distance away. they marvelled to see with what speed these green-clad men now moved, vanishing almost in the twinkling of an eye. the forest where faramir had stood seemed empty and drear, as if a dream had passed.
frodo sighed and turned back southward. as if to mark his disregard of all such courtesy, gollum was scrabbling in the mould at the foot of a tree. `hungry again already?' thought sam. `well, now for it again!'
'have they gone at last? ' said gollum. `nassty wicked men! sméagol's neck still hurts him, yes it does. let's go! '
`yes, let us go,' said frodo. `but if you can only speak ill of those who showed you mercy, keep silent! '
`nice master! ' said gollum. `sméagol was only joking. always forgives, he does, yes, yes, even nice master's little trickses. oh yes, nice master, nice sméago

frodo and sam did not answer. hoisting their packs and taking their staves in hand, they passed on into the woods of ithilien.
twice that day they rested and took a little of the food provided by faramir: dried fruits and salted meat, enough for many days; and bread enough to last while it was still fresh. gollum ate nothing.
the sun rose and passed overhead unseen, and began to sink, and the light through the trees to the west grew golden; and always they walked in cool green shadow, and all about them was silence. the birds seemed all to have flown away or to have fallen dumb.
darkness came early to the silent woods, and before the fall of night they halted, weary, for they had walked seven leagues or more from henneth annûn. frodo lay and slept away the night on the deep mould beneath an ancient tree

 rest. whether he had slept by himself in some hole nearby, or had wandered restlessly prowling through the night, he did not say; but he returned with the first glimmer of light, and roused his companions.
`must get up, yes they must!' he said. 'long ways to go still, south and east. hobbits must make haste!'
that day passed much as the day before had gone, except that the silence seemed deeper; the air grew heavy, and it began to be stifling under the trees. it felt as if thunder was brewing. gollum often paused, sniffing the air, and then he would mutter to himself and urge them to greater speed.
as the third stage of their day's march drew on and afternoon waned, the forest opened out, and the trees became larger and more scattered. great ilexes of huge girth stood dark and solemn in wide glades with here and there among them hoary ash-trees. and giant oaks just putting out their brown-green buds. about them lay long launds of green grass dappled with celandine and anemones, white and blu

e, now folded for sleep; and there were acres populous with the leaves of woodland hyacinths: already their sleek bell-stems were thrusting through the mould. no living creature, beast or bird, was to be seen, but in these open places gollum grew afraid, and they walked now with caution, flitting from one long shadow to another.
light was fading fast when they came to the forest-end. there they sat under an old gnarled oak that sent its roots twisting like snakes down a steep crumbling bank. a deep dim valley lay before them. on its further side the woods gathered again, blue and grey under the sullen evening, and marched on southwards. to the right the mountains of gondor glowed, remote in the west, under a fire-flecked sky. to the

the polluted stream that flowed from the valley of the wraiths.
'what shall we do? ' he said. 'we have walked long and far. shall we look for some place in the woods behind where we can lie hidden? '
'no good hiding in the dark,' said gollum. 'it's in day that hobbits must hide now, yes in day.'
`oh come! ' said sam. 'we must rest for a bit, even if we get up again in the middle of the night. there'll still be hours of dark then time enough for you to take us a long march, if you know the way.'
gollum reluctantly agreed to this, and he turned back towards the trees, working eastward for a while along the straggling edges of the wood. he would not rest on the ground so near the evil road, and after some debate they all climbed up into the crotch of a large holm-oak, whose thick branches springing together from the trunk made a good hiding-place and a fairly comfortable refuge. night fell and it grew altogether dark under the canopy of the tree. frodo and sam drank a little water and ate some b

read and dried fruit, but gollum at once curled up and went to sleep. the hobbits did not shut their eyes.
it must have been a little after midnight when gollum woke up: suddenly they were aware of his pale eyes unlidded gleaming at them. he listened and sniffed, which seemed, as they had noticed before, his usual method of discovering the time of night.
'are we rested? have we had beautiful sleep?' he said. 'let's go!'
'we aren't, and we haven't,' growled sam. 'but we'll go if we must.'
gollum dropped at once from the branches of the tree on to all fours, and the hobbits followed more slowly.
as soon as they were down they went on again with gollum leading, eastwards, up the dark sloping land. they could see little, for the night was now so deep that they were hardly aware of the stems of trees before they stumbled against them. the ground became more broken and walking was more difficult, but gollum seemed in no way troubled. he led them through thickets and wastes of brambles; somet

e downward, always the further slope was longer and steeper. they were climbing steadily. at their first halt they looked back, and they could dimly perceive the roofs of the forest they had left behind lying like a vast dense shadow, a darker night under the dark blank sky. there seemed to be a great blackness looming slowly out of the east, eating up the faint blurred stars. later the sinking moon escaped from the pursuing cloud, but it was ringed all about with a sickly yellow glare.
at last gollum turned to the hobbits. 'day soon,' he said. 'hobbits must hurry. not safe to stay in the open in these places. make haste! '
he quickened his pace, and they followed him wearily. soon they began to climb up on to a great hog-back of land. for the most part it was covered with a thick growth of gorse and whortleberry, and low tough thorns, though here and there clearings opened, the scars of recent fires. the gorse-bushes became more frequent as they got nearer the top; very old and tall they wer

`need we think about it yet?' said sam, `surely we're not going to move any more today, if day it is?'
`perhaps not, perhaps not,' said gollum. `but we must go soon, to the cross-roads. yes, to the cross-roads. that's the way over there yes, master.'
the red glare over mordor died away. the twilight deepened as great vapours rose in the east and crawled above them. frodo and sam took a little food and then lay down, but gollum was restless. he would not eat any of their food, but he drank a little water and then crawled about under the bushes, sniffing and muttering. then. suddenly he disappeared.
`off hunting, i suppose,' said sam and yawned. it was his turn to sleep first, and he was soon deep in a dream. he thought he was back in the bag end garden looking for something; but he had a heavy pack on his back, which made him stoop. it all seemed very weedy and rank somehow, and thorns and bracken were invading the bed

the afternoon, as sam supposed it must be called, wore on. looking out from the covert he could see only a dun, shadowless world, fading slowly into a featureless, colourless gloom. it felt stifling but not warm. frodo slept unquietly, turning and tossing, and sometimes murmuring. twice sam thought he heard him speaking gandalf's name. the time seemed to drag interminably. suddenly sam heard a hiss behind him, and there was gollum on all fours, peering at them with gleaming eyes.
`wake up, wake up! wake up, sleepies!' he whispered. `wake up! no time to lose. we must go, yes, we must go at once. no time to lose!'
sam stared at him suspiciously: he seemed frightened or excited. `go now? what's your little game? it isn't time yet. it can't be tea-time even, leastways not in decent places where there is tea-time.'
`silly! ' hissed gollum. `we're not in decent places. time's running short, yes, running fast. no time to lose. w

'they mustn't be silly,' he hissed. `we must go. no time to lose!' and nothing more could they get out of him. where he had been, and what he thought was brewing to make him in such a hurry, he would not say. sam was filled with deep suspicion, and showed it; but frodo gave no sign of what was passing in his mind. he sighed, hoisted his pack, and prepared to go out into the ever-gathering darkness.
very stealthily gollum led them down the hillside, keeping und

, in their grey cloaks, nor heard them, walking as warily as the little people can. without the crack of a twig or the rustle of a leaf they passed and vanished.
for about an hour they went on, silently, in single file, oppressed by the gloom and by the absolute stillness of the land, broken only now and again by the faint rumbling as of thunder far away or drum-beats in some hollow of the hills. down from their hiding-place they went, and then turning south they steered as straight a course as gollum could find across a long broken slope that leaned up towards the mountains. presently, not far ahead, looming up like a black wall, they saw a belt of trees. as they drew nearer they became aware that these were of vast size, very ancient it seemed, and still towering high, though their tops were gaunt and broken, as if tempest and lightning-blast had swept across them, but had failed to kill them or to shake their fathomless roots.
'the cross-roads, yes,' whispered gollum, the first words that

 beard was broken, but about the high stern forehead there was a coronal of silver and gold. a trailing plant with flowers like small white stars had bound itself across the brows as if in reverence for the fallen king, and in the crevices of his stony hair yellow stonecrop gleamed.
'they cannot conquer for ever!' said frodo. and then suddenly the brief glimpse was gone. the sun dipped and vanished, and as if at the shuttering of a lamp, black night fell.

chapter 8

the stairs of cirith ungol

gollum was tugging at frodo's cloak and hissing with fear and impatience. `we must go,' he said. `we mustn't stand here. make haste!'
reluctantly frodo turned his back on the west and followed as his guide led him, out into the darkness of the east. they left the ring of trees and crept along the road towards the mountains. this road, too, ran straight for a while, but soon it began to bend away southwards, until it came right under the great shoulder of rock that they had seen from the distance. black

frodo and sam were plodding along with heavy hearts, no longer able to care greatly about their peril. frodo's head was bowed; his burden was dragging him down again. as soon as the great cross-roads had been passed, the weight of it, almost forgotten in ithilien, had begun to grow once more. now, feeling the way become steep before his feet, he looked wearily up; and then he saw it, even as gollum had said that he would: the city of the ringwraiths. he cowered against the stony bank.
a long-tilted valley, a deep gulf of shadow, ran back far into the mountains. upon the further side, some way within the valley's arms high on a rocky seat upon the black knees of the ephel dúath, stood the walls and tower of minas morgul. all was dark about it, earth and sky, but it was lit with light. not the imprisoned moonlight welling through the marble walls of minas ithil long ago, tower of the moon,

er indeed than the moon ailing in some slow eclipse was the light of it now, wavering and blowing like a noisome exhalation of decay, a corpse-light, a light that illuminated nothing. in the walls and tower windows showed, like countless black holes looking inward into emptiness; but the topmost course of the tower revolved slowly, first one way and then another, a huge ghostly head leering into the night. for a moment the three companions stood there, shrinking, staring up with unwilling eyes. gollum was the first to recover. again he pulled at their cloaks urgently, but he spoke no word. almost he dragged them forward. every step was reluctant, and time seemed to slow its pace. so that between the raising of a foot and the setting of it down minutes of loathing passed.
so they came slowly to the white bridge. here the road, gleaming faintly, passed over the stream in the midst of the valley, and went on, winding deviously up towards the city's gate: a black mouth opening in the outer circle

ang. figures stood there at its head, carven with cunning in forms human and bestial, but all corrupt and loathsome. the water flowing beneath was silent, and it steamed, but the vapour that rose from it, curling and twisting about the bridge, was deadly cold. frodo felt his senses reeling and his mind darkening. then suddenly, as if some force were at work other than his own will, he began to hurry, tottering forward, his groping hands held out, his head lolling from side to side. both sam and gollum ran after him. sam caught his master in his arms, as he stumbled and almost fell, right on the threshold of the bridge.
`not that way! no, not that way! ' whispered gollum, but the breath between his teeth seemed to tear the heavy stillness like a whistle, and he cowered to the ground in terror.
`hold up, mr. frodo! ' muttered sam in frodo's ear. 'come back! not that way. gollum says not, and for once i agree with him.'
frodo passed his hand over his brow and wrenched his eyes away from the city

ing and guiding his stumbling master, followed after him as quickly as he could. not far from the near bank of the stream there was a gap in the stone-wall beside the road. through this they passed, and sam saw that they were on a narrow path that gleamed faintly at first, as the main road did, until climbing above the meads of deadly flowers it faded and went dark, winding its crooked way up into the northern sides of the valley.
along this path the hobbits trudged, side by side, unable to see gollum in front of them, except when he turned back to beckon them on. then his eyes shone with a green-white light, reflecting the noisome morgul-sheen perhaps, or kindled by some answering mood within. of that deadly gleam and of the dark eyeholes frodo and sam were always conscious, ever glancing fearfully over their shoulders, and ever dragging their eyes back to find the darkening path. slowly they laboured on. as they rose above the stench and vapours of the poisonous stream their breath became e

 bare rock. ahead of them there was a bay in the valley-side, and round the head of this the path went on, no more than a wide ledge with a chasm on the right; across the sheer southward face of the mountain it crawled upwards, until it disappeared into the blackness above.
`i must rest a while, sam,' whispered frodo. `it's heavy on me, sam lad, very heavy. i wonder how far i can carry it? anyway i must rest before we venture on to that.' he pointed to the narrow way ahead.
`sssh! ssh! ' hissed gollum hurrying back to them. `sssh! ' his fingers were on his lips and he shook his head urgently. tugging at frodo's sleeve, he pointed towards the path; but frodo would not move.
`not yet,' he said, 'not yet.' weariness and more than weariness oppressed him; it seemed as if a heavy spell was laid on his mind and body. `i must rest,' he muttered.
at this gollum's fear and agitation became so great that he spoke again, hissing behind his hand, as if to keep the sound from unseen listeners in the air.

ng and his fingers snapping. `foolish! silly! ' he hissed. `make haste! they mustn't think danger has passed. it hasn't. make haste! '
they did not answer, but they followed him on to the climbing ledge. it was little to the liking of either of them, not even after facing so many other perils; but it did not last long. soon the path reached a rounded angle where the mountain-side swelled out again, and there it suddenly entered a narrow opening in the rock. they had come to the first stair that gollum had spoken of. the darkness was almost complete, and they could see nothing much beyond their hands' stretch; but gollum's eyes shone pale, several feet above, as he turned back towards them.
`careful! ' he whispered. `steps. lots of steps. must be careful! '
care was certainly needed. frodo and sam at first felt easier, having now a wall on either side, but the stairway was almost as steep as a ladder, and as they climbed up and up, they became more and more aware of the long black fall behind

 length, just as they felt that they could endure no more, they saw gollum's eyes peering down at them again. `we're up,' he whispered. 'first stair's past. clever hobbits to climb so high, very clever hobbits. just a few more little steps and that's all, yes.'
dizzy and very tired sam, and frodo following him, crawled up the last step, and sat down rubbing their legs and knees. they were in a deep dark passage that seemed still to go up before them, though at a gentler slope and without steps. gollum did not let them rest long.
'there's another stair still,' he said. `much longer stair. rest when we get to the top of next stair. not yet.'
sam groaned. 'longer, did you say? ' he asked.
'yes, yess, longer,' said gollum. `but not so difficult. hobbits have climbed the straight stair. next comes the winding stair.'
'and what after that? ' said sam.
`we shall see,' said gollum softly. `o yes, we shall see! '
'i thought you said there was a tunnel,' said sam. `isn't there a tunnel or something to

the end, when suddenly they felt no wall at their right hand. they could see very little. great black shapeless masses and deep grey shadows loomed above them and about them, but now and again a dull red light flickered up under the lowering clouds, and for a moment they were aware of tall peaks, in front and on either side, like pillars holding up a vast sagging roof. they seemed to have climbed up many hundreds of feet, on to a wide shelf. a cliff was on their left and a chasm on their right.
gollum led the way close under the cliff. for the present they were no longer climbing, but the ground was now more broken and dangerous in the dark, and there were blocks and lumps of fallen stone in the way. their going was slow and cautious. how many hours had passed since they had entered the morgul vale neither sam nor frodo could any longer guess. the night seemed endless.
at length they were once more aware of a wall looming up, and once more a stairway opened before them. again they halted, and

 the terrors of the land beyond, and the deed to be done there, seemed remote, too far off yet to trouble him. all his mind was bent on getting through or over this impenetrable wall and guard. if once he could do that impossible thing, then somehow the errand would be accomplished, or so it seemed to him in that dark hour of weariness, still labouring in the stony shadows under cirith ungol.
in a dark crevice between two great piers of rock they sat down: frodo and sam a little way within. and gollum crouched upon the ground near the opening. there the hobbits took what they expected would be their last meal before they went down into the nameless land, maybe the last meal they would ever eat together. some of the food of gondor they ate, and wafers of the waybread of the elves. and they drank a little. but of their water they were sparing and took only enough to moisten their dry mouths.
`i wonder when we'll find water again? ' said sam. 'but i suppose even over there they drink? orcs drink

 far without sam, would he, dad? " '
`now, mr. frodo,' said sam, 'you shouldn't make fun. i was serious. '
`so was i,' said frodo, 'and so i am. we're going on a bit too fast. you and i, sam, are still stuck in the worst places of the story, and it is all too likely that some will say at this point: "shut the book now, dad; we don't want to read any more." '
`maybe,' said sam, 'but i wouldn't be one to say that. things done and over and made into part of the great tales are different. why, even gollum might be good in a tale, better than he is to have by you, anyway. and he used to like tales himself once, by his own account. i wonder if he thinks he's the hero or the villain?
`gollum!' he called. `would you like to be the hero - now where's he got to again?'
there was no sign of him at the mouth of their shelter nor in the shadows near. he had refused their food, though he had, as usual, accepted a mouthful of water; and then he had seemed to curl up for a sleep: they had supposed that one a

`sleep!' said frodo and sighed, as if out of a desert he had seen a mirage of cool green. 'yes, even here i could sleep.'
`sleep then, master! lay your head in my lap.'
and so gollum found them hours later, when he returned, crawling and creeping down the path out of the gloom ahead. sam sat propped against the stone, his head dropping sideways and his breathing heavy. in his lap lay frodo's head, drowned deep in sleep; upon his white forehead lay one of sam's brown hands, and the other lay softly upon his master's breast. peace was in both their faces.
gollum looked at them. a strange expression passed over his lean hungry face. the gleam faded from his eyes, and they went

ling hand, very cautiously he touched frodo's knee - but almost the touch was a caress. for a fleeting moment, could one of the sleepers have seen him, they would have thought that they beheld an old weary hobbit, shrunken by the years that had carried him far beyond his time, beyond friends and kin, and the fields and streams of youth, an old starved pitiable thing.
but at that touch frodo stirred and cried out softly in his sleep, and immediately sam was wide awake. the first thing he saw was gollum - `pawing at master,' as he thought.
`hey you!' he said roughly. `what are you up to?'
'nothing, nothing,' said gollum softly. `nice master!'
`i daresay,' said sam. 'but where have you been to - sneaking off and sneaking back, you old villain? '
gollum withdrew himself, and a green glint flickered under his heavy lids. almost spider-like he looked now, crouched back on his bent limbs, with his protruding eyes. the fleeting moment had passed, beyond recall. `sneaking, sneaking!' he hissed. 'hobbi

'come, let it pass then,' said frodo. 'but now we seem to have come to the point, you and i, sméagol. tell me. can we find the rest of the way by ourselves? we're in sight of the pass, of a way in, and if we can find it now, then i suppose our agreement can be said to be over. you have done what you promised, and you're free: free to go back to food and rest, wherever you wish to go, except to servants of the enemy. and one day i may reward you, i or those that remember me.'
`no, no, not yet,' gollum whined. `o no! they can't find the way themselves, can they? o no indeed. there's the tunnel coming. sméagol must go on. no rest. no food. not yet.'

chapter 9

shelob's lair

it may indeed have been daytime now, as gollum said, but the hobbits could see little difference, unless, perhaps, the heavy sky above was less utterly black, more like a great roof of smoke; while instead of the darkness of deep night, which lingered still in cracks and holes, a grey blurring shadow shrouded the stony wo

rld about them. they passed on, gollum in front and the hobbits now side by side, up the long ravine between the piers and columns of torn and weathered rock, standing like huge unshapen statues on either hand. there was no sound. some way ahead, a mile or so, perhaps, was a great grey wall, a last huge upthrusting mass of mountain-stone. darker it loomed, and steadily it rose as they approached, until it towered up high above them, shutting out the view of all that lay beyond. deep shadow lay before its feet. sam sniffed the air.

gh! that smell!' he said. `it's getting stronger and stronger.'
presently they were under the shadow, and there in the midst of it they saw the opening of a cave. `this is the way in,' said gollum softly. `this is the entrance to the tunnel.' he did not speak its name: torech ungol, shelob's lair. out of it came a stench, not the sickly odour of decay in the meads of morgul, but a foul reek, as if filth unnameable were piled and hoarded in the dark within.
`is this the only way, sméagol? ' said frodo.
'yes, yes,' he answered. 'yes, we must go this way now.'
'd'you mean to say you've been through this hole?' said sam. `phew! but perhaps you don't mind bad smells.'
gollum's eyes glinted. `

uld be, and night was all.
but for a while they could still feel, and indeed the senses of their feet and fingers at first seemed sharpened almost painfully. the walls felt, to their surprise, smooth, and the floor, save for a step now and again, was straight and even, going ever up at the same stiff slope. the tunnel was high and wide, so wide that, though the hobbits walked abreast, only touching the side-walls with their outstretched hands, they were separated, cut off alone in the darkness.
gollum had gone in first and seemed to be only a few steps ahead. while they were still able to give heed to such things, they could hear his breath hissing and gasping just in front of them. but after a time their senses became duller, both touch and hearing seemed to grow numb, and they kept on, groping, walking, on and on, mainly by the force of the will with which they had entered, will to go through and desire to come at last to the high gate beyond.

g, but whether that was so or not, suddenly it was easier to move, as if some hostile will for the moment had released them. they struggled on, still hand in hand.
but almost at once they came to a new difficulty. the tunnel forked, or so it seemed, and in the dark they could not tell which was the wider way, or which kept nearer to the straight. which should they take, the left, or the right? they knew of nothing to guide them, yet a false choice would almost certainly be fatal.
`which way has gollum gone? ' panted sam. 'and why didn't he wait? '
`sméagol! ' said frodo, trying to call. 'sméagol! ' but his voice croaked, and the name fell dead almost as it left his lips. there was no answer, not an echo, not even a tremor of the air.
`he's really gone this time, i fancy,' muttered sam. `i guess this is just exactly where he meant to bring us. gollum! if ever i lay hands on you again, you'll be sorry for it.'
presently, groping and fumbling in the dark, they found that the opening on the lef

t was blocked: either it was a blind, or else some great stone had fallen in the passage. 'this can't be the way,' frodo whispered. 'right or wrong, we must take the other.'
'and quick! ' sam panted. 'there's something worse than gollum about. i can feel something looking at us.'
they had not gone more than a few yards when from behind them came a sound, startling and horrible in the heavy padded silence: a gurgling, bubbling noise, and a long venomous hiss. they wheeled round, but nothing could be seen. still as stones they stood, staring, waiting for they did not know what.
`it's a trap!' said sam, and he laid his hand upon the hilt of his sword; and as he did so, he thought of the darkness of the barrow whence it came. 'i wi

rawing his hand across his mouth.
`it will take days to clear the road like this,' he said. `what's to be done? have those eyes come back? '
`no, not to be seen,' said frodo. `but i still feel that they are looking at me, or thinking about me: making some other plan, perhaps. if this light were lowered, or if it failed, they would quickly come again.'
`trapped in the end! ' said sam bitterly, his anger rising again above weariness and despair. `gnats in a net. may the curse of faramir bite that gollum and bite him quick! '
'that would not help us now,' said frodo. `come! let us see what sting can do. it is an elven-blade. there were webs of horror in the dark ravines of beleriand where it was forged. but you must be the guard and hold back the eyes. here, take the star-glass. do not be afraid. hold it up and watch!'
then frodo stepped up to the great grey net, and hewed it with a wide sweeping stroke, drawing the bitter edge swiftly across a ladder of close-strung cords, and at once springing

already, years before, gollum had beheld her, sméagol who pried into all dark holes, and in past days he had bowed and worshipped her, and the darkness of her evil will walked through all the ways of his weariness beside him, cutting him off from light and from regret. and he had promised to bring her food. but her lust was not his lust. little she knew of or cared for towers, or rings, or anything devised by mind or hand, who only desired death for all others, mind and body, and for herself a glut of life. alone, swollen t

and the darkness could not contain her.
but that desire was yet far away, and long now had she been hungry, lurking in her den, while the power of sauron grew, and light and living things forsook his borders; and the city in the valley was dead, and no elf or man came near, only the unhappy orcs. poor food and wary. but she must eat, and however busily they delved new winding passages from the pass and from their tower, ever she found some way to snare them. but she lusted for sweeter meat. and gollum had brought it to her.
`we'll see, we'll see,' he said often to himself, when the evil mood was on him, as he walked the dangerous road from emyn muil to morgul vale, 'we'll see. it may well be, o yes, it may well be that when she throws away the bones and the empty garments, we shall find it, we shall get it, the precious, a reward for poor sméagol who brings nice food. and we'll save the precious, as we promised. o yes. and when we've got it safe, then she'll know it, o yes, then we'll pay he

 phial, running heedless up the path, unaware yet of his peril. swiftly he ran, but shelob was swifter; in a few leaps she would have him.
sam gasped and gathered all his remaining breath to shout. 'look out behind! ' he yelled. 'look out master! i'm' - but suddenly his cry was stifled.
a long clammy hand went over his mouth and another caught him by the neck, while something wrapped itself about his leg. taken off his guard he toppled backwards into the arms of his attacker.
`got him! ' hissed gollum in his ear. `at last, my precious, we've got him, yes, the nassty hobbit. we takes this one. she'll get the other. o yes, shelob will get him, not sméagol: he promised; he won't hurt master at all. but he's got you, you nassty filthy little sneak!' he spat on sam's neck.
fury at the treachery, and desperation at the delay when his master was in deadly peril, gave to sam a sudden violence and strength that was far beyond anything that gollum had expected from this slow stupid hobbit, as he thoug

ht him. not gollum himself could have twisted more quickly or more fiercely. his hold on sam's mouth slipped, and sam ducked and lunged forward again, trying to tear away from the grip on his neck. his sword was still in his hand, and on his left arm, hanging by its thong, was faramir's staff. desperately he tried to turn and stab his enemy. but gollum was too quick. his long right arm shot out, and he grabbed sam's wrist: his fingers were like a vice; slowly and relentlessly he bent the hand down and forward, till with a cry of pain sam released the sword and it fell to the ground; and all the while gollum's other hand was tightening on sam's throat.
then sam played his last trick. with all his strength he pulled away and got his feet firmly planted; then suddenly he drove his legs against the ground and with his whole force hurled himself ba

not expecting even this simple trick from sam, gollum fell over with sam on top, and he received the weight of the sturdy hobbit in his stomach. a sharp hiss came out of him, and for a second his hand upon sam's throat loosened; but his fingers still gripped the sword-hand. sam tore himself forward and away, and stood up, and then quickly he wheeled away to his right, pivoted on the wrist held by gollum. laying hold of the staff with his left hand, sam swung it up, and down it came with a whistling crack on gollum's outstretched arm, just below the

my, little less than his own size. this fight was not for him. sam swept up his sword from the ground and raised it. gollum squealed, and springing aside on to all fours, he jumped away in one big bound like a frog. before sam could reach him, he was off, running with amazing speed back towards the tunnel.
sword in hand sam went after him. for the moment he had forgotten everything else but the red fury in his brain and the desire to kill gollum. but before he could overtake him, gollum was gone. then as the dark hole stood before him and the stench came out to meet him, like a clap of thunder the thought of frodo and the monster smote upon sam's mind. he spun round, and rushed wildly up the path, calling and calling his master's name. he was too late. so far gollum's plot had succeeded.

but he could not go, not yet. he knelt and held frodo's hand and could not release it. and time went by and still he knelt, holding his master's hand, and in his heart keeping a debate.
now he tried to find strength to tear himself away and go on a lonely journey - for vengeance. if once he could go, his anger would bear him down all the roads of the world, pursuing, until he had him at last: gollum. then gollum would die in a corner. but that was not what he had set out to do. it would not be worth while to leave his master for that. it would not bring him back. nothing would. they had better both be dead together. and that too would be a lonely journey.
he looked on the bright point of the sword. he thought of the places behind where there was a black brink and an empty fall into nothingness. there was no escape that way. that was to do nothing, not even to grieve. that was not what he had set out to
