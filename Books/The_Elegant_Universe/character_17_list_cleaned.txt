[CHARACTER]([CHARACTER]) - 
a scottish physicist. maxwell developed the set of
four equations that became the basis of electromagnetic theory,
the single force unifying electricity and magnetism. maxwell's work had
a huge influence on twentieth-century physics, and he is ranked
alongside isaac newton and albert einstein for the scope of his
contributions. maxwell's field equations prompted max planck to
formulate the quantum hypothesis--the theory that radiant-heat energy
is emitted only in finite quantities, or quanta.
