isitor. the prudent old woman saw at once what was to be done.

"you cannot run away," said she to cunegonde, "and you have nothing to fear, for it was not you that killed my lord; besides the governor who loves you will not suffer you to be ill-treated; therefore stay."

she then ran immediately to candide.

"fly," said she, "or in an hour you will be burnt."

there was not a moment to lose; but how could he part from cunegonde, and where could he flee for shelter?[pg 58]

how candide and cacambo were received by the jesuits of paraguay.

candide had brought such a valet with him from cadiz, as one often meets with on the coasts of spain and in the american colonies. he was a quarter spaniard, born of a mongrel in tucuman; he had been singing-boy, sacristan, sailor, monk, pedlar, soldier, and lackey. his name was cacambo, and he loved his master, because his master was a very good man. he quickly saddled the two andalusian horses.

"come, master, let us follow the old woman's advice; le

t us start, and run without looking behind us."

candide shed tears.

"oh! my dear cunegonde! must i leave you just at a time when the governor was going to sanction our nuptials? cunegonde, brought to such a distance what will become of you?"

"she will do as well as she can," said cacambo; "the women are never at a loss, god provides for them, let us run."

"whither art thou carrying me? where shall[pg 59] we go? what shall we do without cunegonde?" said candide.

"by st. james of compostella," said cacambo, "you were going to fight against the jesuits; let us go to fight for them; i know the road well, i'll conduct you to their kingdom, where they will be charmed to have a captain that understands the bulgarian exercise. you'll make a prodigious fortune; if we cannot find our a

ccount in one world we shall in another. it is a great pleasure to see and do new things."

"you have before been in paraguay, then?" said candide.

"ay, sure," answered cacambo, "i was servant in the college of the assumption, and am acquainted with the government of the good fathers as well as i am with the streets of cadiz. it is an admirable government. the kingdom is upwards of three hundred leagues in diameter, and divided into thirty provinces; there the fathers possess all, and the people nothing; it is a masterpiece of reason and justice. for my part i see nothing so divine as the fathers who here make war upon the kings of spain and portugal, and in europe co

nfess those kings; who here kill spaniards, and in madrid send them to heaven; this delights me, let us push forward. you are going to be the happiest of mortals. what pleasure will it be to those[pg 60] fathers to hear that a captain who knows the bulgarian exercise has come to them!"

as soon as they reached the first barrier, cacambo told the advanced guard that a captain wanted to speak with my lord the commandant. notice was given to the main guard, and immediately a paraguayan officer ran and laid himself at the feet of the commandant, to impart this news to him. candide and cacambo were disarmed, and their two andalusian horses seized. the strangers were introduced between two files of musketeers; the commandant was at the further end, with the three-cornered cap on his head, his gown tucked up, a sword by his side, and

 a spontoon[15] in his hand. he beckoned, and straightway the new-comers were encompassed by four-and-twenty soldiers. a sergeant told them they must wait, that the commandant could not speak to them, and that the reverend father provincial does not suffer any spaniard to open his mouth but in his presence, or to stay above three hours in the province.

"and where is the reverend father provincial?" said cacambo.

"he is upon the parade just after celebrating mass," answered the sergeant, "and you cannot kiss his spurs till three hours hence."

"however," said cacambo, "the captain is not a spaniard, but a german, he is ready to perish[pg 61] with hunger as well as myself; cannot we have something for breakfast, while we wait for his reverence?"

the sergeant went immediately to acquaint the commandant with what he had heard.

"god be praised!" said the reverend commandant, "since he is a german, i may

n excellent breakfast was provided in vessels of gold; and while the paraguayans were eating maize out of wooden dishes, in the open fields and exposed to the heat of the sun, the reverend father commandant retired to his arbour.

he was a very handsome young man, with a full face, white skin but high in colour; he had an arched eyebrow, a lively eye, red ears, vermilion lips, a bold air, but such a boldness as neither belonged to a spaniard nor a jesuit. they returned their arms to candide and cacambo, and also the two andalusian horses; to whom cacambo gave some oats to eat just by the arbour, having an eye upon them all the while for fear of a surprise.[pg 62]

candide first kissed the hem of the commandant's robe, then they sat down to table.

"you are, then, a german?" said the jesuit to him in that language.

"yes, reverend father," answered candide.

as they pronounced these words they looked at each other with great amazement, and with such an emotion as they could not conceal.

"and

see that, thou scoundrel!" said the jesuit baron de thunder-ten-tronckh, and that instant struck him across the face with the flat of his sword. candide in an instant drew his rapier, and plunged it up to the hilt in the jesuit's belly; but in pulling it out reeking hot, he burst into tears.

"good god!" said he, "i have killed my old master, my friend, my brother-in-law! i am the best-natured creature in the world, and yet i have already killed three men, and of these three two were priests."

cacambo, who stood sentry by the door of the arbour, ran to him.

"we have nothing more for it than to sell our lives as dearly as we can," said his master to him, "without doubt some one will soon enter the arbour, and we must die sword in hand."

cacambo, who had been in a great many[pg 67] scrapes in his lifetime, did not lose his head; he took the baron's jesuit habit, put it on candide, gave him the square cap, and made him mount on horseback. all this was done in the twinkling of an eye.

"let us

he flew as he spoke these words, crying out aloud in spanish:

adventures of the two travellers, with two girls, two monkeys, and the savages called oreillons.

candide and his valet had got beyond the barrier, before it was known in the camp that the german jesuit was dead. the wary cacambo had taken care to fill his wallet with bread, chocolate, bacon, fruit, and a few bottles of wine. with their andalusian horses they penetrated into an unknown country, where they perceived no beaten track. at length they came to a beautiful meadow intersected with purling rills. here our two adventurers fed their horses. cacambo proposed to his master to take some food, and he set him an example.

"how can you ask me to eat ham," said candide, "after killing the baron's son, and being doomed ne

 and alarm which every little thing inspires in an unknown country. the noise was made by two naked girls, who tripped along the mead, while two monkeys were pursuing them and biting their buttocks. candide was moved with pity; he had learned to fire a gun in the bulgarian service, and he was so clever at it, that he could hit a filbert in a hedge without touching a leaf of the tree. he took up his double-barrelled spanish fusil, let it off, and killed the two monkeys.

"god be praised! my dear cacambo, i have rescued those two poor creatures from a most perilous situation. if i have committed a sin in killing an inquisitor and a jesuit, i have made ample amends by saving the lives of these girls. perhaps they are young ladies of family; and this adventure may procure us great advantages in this country."

he was continuing, but stopped short when he saw the two girls tenderly embracing the monkeys, bathing their bodies in tears, and rending the air with the most dismal lamentations.

"little

 did i expect to see such good-nature,"[pg 70] said he at length to cacambo; who made answer:

"master, you have done a fine thing now; you have slain the sweethearts of those two young ladies."

"the sweethearts! is it possible? you are jesting, cacambo, i can never believe it!"

"dear master," replied cacambo; "you are surprised at everything. why should you think it so strange that in some countries there are monkeys which insinuate themselves into the good graces of the ladies; they are a fourth part human, as i am a fourth part spaniard."

"alas!" replied candide, "i remember to have heard master pangloss say, that formerly such accidents used to happen; that these mixtures were productive of centaurs, fauns, and satyrs; and that many of the ancients had seen such monsters, but i looked upon the

whole as fabulous."

"you ought now to be convinced," said cacambo, "that it is the truth, and you see what use is made of those creatures, by persons that have not had a proper education; all i fear is that those ladies will play us some ugly trick."

these sound reflections induced candide to leave the meadow and to plunge into a wood. he supped there with cacambo; and after cursing the portuguese inquisitor, the governor of buenos ayres, and the baron, they fell asleep[pg 71] on moss. on awaking they felt that they could not move; for during the night the oreillons, who inhabited that country, and to whom the ladies had denounced them, had bound them with cords made of the bark of trees. they were encompassed by fifty naked oreillons, armed with bows and arrows, with clubs and flint hatchets. some were making a large cauldron boil, others were preparing

 spits, and all cried:

"a jesuit! a jesuit! we shall be revenged, we shall have excellent cheer, let us eat the jesuit, let us eat him up!"

"i told you, my dear master," cried cacambo sadly, "that those two girls would play us some ugly trick."

candide seeing the cauldron and the spits, cried:

"we are certainly going to be either roasted or boiled. ah! what would master pangloss say, were he to see how pure nature is formed? everything is right, may be, but i declare it is very hard to have lost miss cunegonde and to be put upon a spit by oreillons."

cacambo never lost his head.

"do not despair," said he to the disconsolate candide, "i understand a little of the jargon o

f these people, i will speak to them."

"be sure," said candide, "to represent to them[pg 72] how frightfully inhuman it is to cook men, and how very un-christian."

"gentlemen," said cacambo, "you reckon you are to-day going to feast upon a jesuit. it is all very well, nothing is more unjust than thus to treat your enemies. indeed, the law of nature teaches us to kill our neighbour, and such is the practice all over the world. if we do not accustom ourselves to eating them, it is because we have better fare. but you have not the same resources as we; certainly it is much better to devour your enemies than to resign to the crows and rooks the fruits of your victory. but, gentlemen,

 not help being surprised at the cause of his deliverance.

"what people!" said he; "what men! what manners! if i had not been so lucky as to run miss cunegonde's brother through the body, i should have been devoured without redemption. but, after all, pure nature is good, since these people, instead of feasting upon my flesh, have shown me a thousand civilities, when then i was not a jesuit."[pg 74]

arrival of candide and his valet at el dorado, and what they saw there.

"you see," said cacambo to candide, as soon as they had reached the frontiers of the oreillons, "that this hemisphere is not better than the others, take my word for it; let us go back to europe by the shortest way."

"how go back?" said candide, "and where shall we go? to my own country? the bulgarians and the abares are slaying all; to portugal? there i shall be burnt; and if we abide here we are every moment in danger of being spitted. but how can i resolve to quit a part of the world where my dear cunegonde reside

s?"

"let us turn towards cayenne," said cacambo, "there we shall find frenchmen, who wander all over the world; they may assist us; god will perhaps have pity on us."

it was not easy to get to cayenne; they knew vaguely in which direction to go, but rivers, precipices, robbers, savages, obstructed them all the way. their horses died of fatigue. their provisions were consumed; they fed a whole[pg 75] month upon wild fruits, and found themselves at last near a little river bordered with cocoa trees, which sustained their lives and their hopes

cacambo, who was as good a counsellor as the old woman, said to candide:

"we are able to hold out no longer; we have walked enough. i see an empty canoe near the river-side; let us fill it with cocoanuts, throw ourselves into it, and go with the current; a river always leads to some inhabited spot. if we do not find pleasant things we shall at least find new things."

"with all my heart," said candide, "let us recommend ourselves to providence."

they rowed a few leagues, between banks, in some places

essible mountains. the country was cultivated[pg 76] as much for pleasure as for necessity. on all sides the useful was also the beautiful. the roads were covered, or rather adorned, with carriages of a glittering form and substance, in which were men and women of surprising beauty, drawn by large red sheep which surpassed in fleetness the finest coursers of andalusia, tetuan, and mequinez.[18]

"here, however, is a country," said candide, "which is better than westphalia."

he stepped out with cacambo towards the first village which he saw. some children dressed in tattered brocades played at quoits on the outskirts. our travellers from the other world amused themselves by looking on. the quoits were large round pieces, yellow, red, and green, which cast a singular lustre! the travellers picked a few of them off the ground; this was of gold, that of emeralds, the other of rubies—the least of them would have been the greatest ornament on the mogul's throne.

"without doubt," said cacambo, "

a most humble manner, giving him to understand by signs that their royal highnesses had forgotten their gold and jewels. the schoolmaster, smiling, flung them upon the ground; then, looking at candide with a good deal of surprise, went about his business.

the travellers, however, took care to gather up the gold, the rubies, and the emeralds.

"where are we?" cried candide. "the king's children in this country must be well brought up, since they are taught to despise gold and precious stones."

cacambo was as much surprised as candide. at length they drew near the first house in the village. it was built like an european palace. a crowd of people pressed about the door, and there were still more in the house. they heard most agreeable music, and were aware of a delicious odour of cooking. cacambo went up to the door and heard they were talking peruvian; it was his mother tongue, for it is well known that cacambo was born in tucuman, in a village where no other language was spoken.

"i will be

y served four dishes of soup, each garnished with two young parrots; a boiled condor[19] which weighed two hundred pounds; two roasted monkeys, of excellent flavour; three hundred humming-birds in one dish, and six hundred fly-birds in another; exquisite ragouts; delicious pastries; the whole served up in dishes of a kind of rock-crystal. the waiters and girls poured out several liqueurs drawn from the sugar-cane.

most of the company were chapmen and waggoners, all extremely polite; they asked cacambo a few questions with the greatest circumspection, and answered his in the most obliging manner.

as soon as dinner was over, cacambo believed as well as candide that they might well pay their reckoning by laying down two of those large gold pieces which they had picked up. the landlord and landlady shouted with laughter and held their sides. when the fit was over:

"gentlemen," said the landlord, "it is plain you are strangers, and such guests we are not accustomed to see; pardon us therefore f

or laughing when you offered us the pebbles from our highroads in payment of your reckoning. you doubtless have not the money of the country;[pg 79] but it is not necessary to have any money at all to dine in this house. all hostelries established for the convenience of commerce are paid by the government. you have fared but very indifferently because this is a poor village; but everywhere else, you will be received as you deserve."

cacambo explained this whole discourse with great astonishment to candide, who was as greatly astonished to hear it.

"what sort of a country then is this," said they to one another; "a country unknown to all the rest of the world, and where nature is of a kind so different from ours? it is probably the country where all is well; for there absolutely must be one such place. and, whatever master pangloss might say, i often found that things went very ill in westphalia."[pg 80]

what they saw in t

he country of el dorado.

cacambo expressed his curiosity to the landlord, who made answer:

"i am very ignorant, but not the worse on that account. however, we have in this neighbourhood an old man retired from court who is the most learned and most communicative person in the kingdom."

at once he took cacambo to the old man. candide acted now only a second character, and accompanied his valet. they entered a very plain house, for the door was only of silver, and the ceilings were only of gold, but wrought in so elegant a taste as to vie with the richest. the antechamber, indeed, was only encrusted with rubies and emeralds, but the order in which everything was arranged made amends for this great simplicity.

 years ago; but being surrounded by inaccessible rocks and precipices, we have hitherto been sheltered from the rapaciousness of european nations, who have an inconceivable passion for the pebbles and dirt of our land, for the sake of which they would murder us to the last man."

the conversation was long: it turned chiefly on their form of government, their manners,[pg 82] their women, their public entertainments, and the arts. at length candide, having always had a taste for metaphysics, made cacambo ask whether there was any religion in that country.

the old man reddened a little.

"how then," said he, "can you doubt it? do you take us for ungrateful wretches?"

cacambo humbly asked, "what was the religion in el dorado?"

the old man reddened again.

"can there be two religions?" said he. "we have, i believe, the religion of all the world: we worship god night and morning."

"do you worship but one god?" said cacambo, who still acted as interpreter in representing candide's doubts.

"sure

as the finest upon earth. it is evident that one must travel."

after this long conversation the old man ordered a coach and six sheep to be got ready, and twelve of his domestics to conduct the travellers to court.

"excuse me," said he, "if my age deprives me of the honour of accompanying you. the king will receive you in a manner that cannot displease you; and no doubt you will make[pg 84] an allowance for the customs of the country, if some things should not be to your liking."

candide and cacambo got into the coach, the six sheep flew, and in less than four hours they reached the king's palace situated at the extremity of the capital. the portal was two hundred and twenty feet high, and one hundred wide; but words are wanting to express the materials of which it was built. it is plain such materials must have prodigious superiority over those pebbles and sand which we call gold and precious stones.

twenty beautiful damsels of the king's guard received candide and cacambo as they alight

ed from the coach, conducted them to the bath, and dressed them in robes woven of the down of humming-birds; after which the great crown officers, of both sexes, led them to the king's apartment, between two files of musicians, a thousand on each side. when they drew near to the audience chamber cacambo asked one of the great officers in what way he should pay his obeisance to his majesty; whether they should throw themselves upon their knees or on their stomachs; whether they should put their hands upon their heads or behind their backs; whether they should lick the dust off the floor; in a word, what was the ceremony?

"the custom," said the great officer, "is to[pg 85] embrace the king, and to kiss him on each cheek."

candide and cacambo threw themselves round his majesty's neck. he receiv

ne, and that they were strangers to lawsuits. he asked if they had any prisons, and they answered no. but what surprised him most and gave him the greatest pleasure was the palace of sciences, where he saw a gallery two thousand feet long, and filled with instruments employed in mathematics and physics.

after rambling about the city the whole afternoon, and seeing but a thousandth part of it, they were reconducted to the royal palace, where candide sat down to table with his majesty, his valet cacambo, and several ladies. never was[pg 86] there a better entertainment, and never was more wit shown at a table than that which fell from his majesty. cacambo explained the king's bon-mots to candide, and notwithstanding they were translated they still appeared to be bon-mots. of all the things that surprised candide this was not the least.

they spent a month in this hospitable place. candide frequently said to cacambo:

"i own, my friend, once more that the castle where i was born is nothing in c

omparison with this; but, after all, miss cunegonde is not here, and you have, without doubt, some mistress in europe. if we abide here we shall only be upon a footing with the rest, whereas, if we return to our old world, only with twelve sheep laden with the pebbles of el dorado, we shall be richer than all the kings in europe. we shall have no more inquisitors to fear, and we may easily recover miss cunegonde."

this speech was agreeable to cacambo; mankind are so fond of roving, of making a figure in their own country, and of boasting of what they have seen in their travels, that the two happy ones resolved to be no longer so, but to ask his majesty's leave to quit the country.

"you are foolish," said the king. "i am sensible that my kingdom is but a small place, but when a person is comfortably settled in any[pg 87] part he should abide there. i have not the right to detain strangers. it is a tyranny which neither our manners nor our l

ountry."

the king laughed.

"i cannot conceive," said he, "what pleasure you europeans find in our yellow clay, but take as much as you like, and great good may it do you."

at once he gave directions that his engineers should construct a machine to hoist up these two[pg 88] extraordinary men out of the kingdom. three thousand good mathematicians went to work; it was ready in fifteen days, and did not cost more than twenty million sterling in the specie of that country. they placed candide and cacambo on the machine. there were two great red sheep saddled and bridled to ride upon as soon as they were beyond the mountains, twenty pack-sheep laden with provisions, thirty with presents of the curiosities of the country, and fifty with gold, diamonds, and precious stones. the king embraced the two wanderers very tenderly.

their departure, with the ingenious manner in which they and their sheep were hoisted over the mountains, was a splendid spectacle. the mathematicians took their leave after c

 agreeably. they were delighted with possessing more treasure than all asia, europe, and africa could scrape together. candide, in his raptures, cut cunegonde's name on the trees. the second day two of their sheep plunged into a morass, where they and their burdens were lost; two more died of fatigue a few days after; seven or eight perished with hunger in a desert; and others subsequently fell down precipices. at length, after travelling a hundred days, only two sheep remained. said candide to cacambo:

"my friend, you see how perishable are the riches of this world; there is nothing solid but virtue, and the happiness of seeing cunegonde once more."

"i grant all you say," said cacambo, "but we have still two sheep remaining, with more treasure than the king of spain will ever have; and i see a town which i take to be surinam, belonging[pg 90] to the dutch. we are at the end of all our troubles, and at the beginning of happiness."

as they drew near the town, they saw a negro stretched upon

"oh, pangloss!" cried candide, "thou hadst not guessed at this abomination; it is the end. i must at last renounce thy optimism."

"what is this optimism?" said cacambo.

"alas!" said candide, "it is the madness of maintaining that everything is right when it is wrong."

looking at the negro, he shed tears, and weeping, he entered surinam.

the first thing they inquired after was whether there was a vessel in the harbour which could be sent to buenos ayres. the person to whom they applied was a spanish sea-captain, who offered to agree with them upon reasonable terms. he appointed to meet them at a public-house, whither candide and the faithful cacambo[pg 92] 
 
 ___________________________
 
went with their two sheep, and awaited his coming.

candide, who had his heart upon his lips, told the spaniard all his adventures, and avowed that he intended to elope with miss cunegonde.

"then i will take good care not to carry you to buenos ayres," said the seaman. "i should be hanged, and so would you. the fair cunegonde is my lord's favourite mistress."

this was a thunderclap for candide: he wept for a long while. at last he drew cacambo aside.

"here, my dear friend," said he to him, "this thou must do. we have, each of us in his pocket, five or six millions in diamonds; you are more clever than i; you must go and bring miss cunegonde from buenos ayres. if the governor makes any difficulty, give him a million; if he will not relinquish her, give him two; as you have not killed an inquisitor, they will have no suspicion of you; i'll get another ship, and go and wait for you at venice; that's a free country, where there is no da

nger either from bulgarians, abares, jews, or inquisitors."

cacambo applauded this wise resolution. he despaired at parting from so good a master, who had become his intimate friend; but the pleasure of serving him prevailed over the pain of leaving him. they embraced with tears;[pg 93] candide charged him not to forget the good old woman. cacambo set out that very same day. this cacambo was a very honest fellow.

candide stayed some time longer in surinam, waiting for another captain to carry him and the two remaining sheep to italy. after he had hired domestics, and purchased everything necessary for a long voyage, mynheer vanderdendur, captain of a large vessel, came and offered his services.

"how much will you charge," said he to this man, "to carry me straight to venice—me, my servants, my baggage, and these two sheep?"

the skipper asked ten thousand piastres. candide

two thousand five hundred leagues from here, and i wait for an answer."

the abbé listened attentively, and seemed to be in a brown study. he soon took his leave of the two foreigners after a most tender embrace. the following day candide received, on awaking, a letter couched in these terms:

"my very dear love, for eight days i have been ill in this town. i learn that you are here. i would fly to your arms if i could but move. i was informed of your passage at bordeaux, where i left faithful cacambo and the old woman, who are to follow me very soon. the governor of buenos ayres has taken all, but[pg 118] there remains to me your heart. come! your presence will either give me life or kill me with pleasure."

this charming, this unhoped-for letter transported candide with an inexpressible joy, and the illness of his dear cunegonde overwhelmed him with grief. divided between those two passions, he took his gold and his diamonds and hurried away, with martin, to the hotel where miss cunegonde

he would not set foot on shore, and he made a bargain with the dutch skipper (were he even to rob him like the surinam captain) to conduct him without delay to venice.

the skipper was ready in two days. they[pg 124] coasted france; they passed in sight of lisbon, and candide trembled. they passed through the straits, and entered the mediterranean. at last they landed at venice.

"god be praised!" said candide, embracing martin. "it is here that i shall see again my beautiful cunegonde. i trust cacambo as myself. all is well, all will be well, all goes as well as possible."[pg 125]

of paquette and friar giroflée.

upon their arrival at venice, candide went to search for cacambo at every inn and coffee-house, and among all the ladies of pleasure, but to no purpose. he sent every day to inquire on all the ships that came in. but there was no news of cacambo.

"what!" said he to martin, "i have had time to voyage from surinam to bordeaux, to go from bordeaux to paris, from paris to diepp

d neither[pg 126] went to see the opera, nor any of the other diversions of the carnival; nay, he was proof against the temptations of all the ladies.

"you are in truth very simple," said martin to him, "if you imagine that a mongrel valet, who has five or six millions in his pocket, will go to the other end of the world to seek your mistress and bring her to you to venice. if he find her, he will keep her to himself; if he do not find her he will get another. i advise you to forget your valet cacambo and your mistress cunegonde."

martin was not consoling. candide's melancholy increased; and martin continued to prove to him that there was very little virtue or happiness upon earth, except perhaps in el dorado, where nobody could gain admittance.

while they were disputing on this important subject and waiting for cunegonde, candide saw a young theatin friar in st. mark's piazza, holding a girl on his arm. the theatin looked fresh coloured, plump, and vigorous; his eyes were sparkling, his a

"but is there not a pleasure," said candide,[pg 141] "in criticising everything, in pointing out faults where others see nothing but beauties?"

"that is to say," replied martin, "that there is some pleasure in having no pleasure."

"well, well," said candide, "i find that i shall be the only happy man when i am blessed with the sight of my dear cunegonde."

"it is always well to hope," said martin.

however, the days and the weeks passed. cacambo did not come, and candide was so overwhelmed with grief that he did not even reflect that paquette and friar giroflée did not return to thank him.[pg 142]

of a supper which candide and martin took with six strangers, and who they were.[34]

one evening that candide and martin were going to sit down to supper with some foreigners who lodged in the same inn, a man whose complexion was as black as soot, came behind candide, and taking him by the arm, said:

"get yourself ready to go along

with us; do not fail."

upon this he turned round and saw—cacambo! nothing but the sight of cunegonde could have astonished and delighted him more. he was on the point of going mad with joy. he embraced his dear friend.

"cunegonde is here, without doubt; where is she? take me to her that i may die of joy in her company."

"cunegonde is not here," said cacambo, "she is at constantinople."

"oh, heavens! at constantinople! but were she in china i would fly thither; let us be off."

"we shall set out after supper," replied[pg 143] cacambo. "i can tell you nothing more; i am a slave, my master awaits me, i must serve him at table; speak not a word, eat, and then get ready."

candide, distracted between joy and grief, delighted at seeing his faithful agent again, astonished at finding him a slave, filled with the fresh hope of recovering his mistress, hi

s heart palpitating, his understanding confused, sat down to table with martin, who saw all these scenes quite unconcerned, and with six strangers who had come to spend the carnival at venice.

cacambo waited at table upon one of the strangers; towards the end of the entertainment he drew near his master, and whispered in his ear:

"sire, your majesty may start when you please, the vessel is ready."

on saying these words he went out. the company in great surprise looked at one another without speaking a word, when another domestic approached his master and said to him:

"sire, your majesty's chaise is at padua, and the boat is ready."

the master gave a nod and the servant went away. the com

er, who sat near candide. he said to him:

"faith, sire, they will no longer give credit to your majesty nor to me, and we may perhaps both of us be put in jail this very night. therefore i will take care of myself. adieu."

the servants being all gone, the six strangers, with candide and martin, remained in a profound silence. at length candide broke it.

"gentlemen," said he, "this is a very good joke indeed, but why should you all be kings? for me i own that neither martin nor i is a king."

cacambo's master then gravely answered in italian:

"i am not at all joking. my name is achmet iii. i was grand sultan many years. i dethroned my brother; my nephew dethroned me, my viziers were beheaded, and i am condemned to end my days in the old seraglio. my nephew,[pg 145] the great sultan mahmoud, permits me to travel sometimes for my health, and i am come to spend the carnival at venice."

a young man who sat next to achmet, spoke then as follows:

"my name is ivan. i was once emperor of all the

s to one another, "who is able to give, and really has given, a hundred times as much as any of us?"

just as they rose from table, in came four serene highnesses, who had also been stripped of their territories by the fortune of war, and were come to spend the carnival at venice. but candide paid no regard to these newcomers, his thoughts were entirely employed on his voyage to constantinople, in search of his beloved cunegonde.[pg 148]

candide's voyage to constantinople.

the faithful cacambo had already prevailed upon the turkish skipper, who was to conduct the sultan achmet to constantinople, to receive candide and martin on his ship. they both embarked after having made their obeisance to his miserable highness.

"you see," said candide to martin on the way, "we supped with six dethroned kings, and of those six there was one to whom i gave charity. perhaps there are many other princes yet more unfortunate. for my part, i have only lost a hundred sheep; and now i am flying into cu

 very strange adventure we met with at venice. it has never before been seen or heard that six dethroned kings have supped together at a public inn."

"it is not more extraordinary," said martin, "than most of the things that have happened to us. it is a very common thing for kings to be[pg 149] dethroned; and as for the honour we have had of supping in their company, it is a trifle not worth our attention."

no sooner had candide got on board the vessel than he flew to his old valet and friend cacambo, and tenderly embraced him.

"well," said he, "what news of cunegonde? is she still a prodigy of beauty? does she love me still? how is she? thou hast doubtless bought her a palace at constantinople?"

"my dear master," answered cacambo, "cunegonde washes dishes on the banks of the propontis, in the service of a prince, who has very few dishes to wash; she is a slave in the family of an ancient sovereign named ragotsky,[35] to whom the grand turk allows three crowns a day in his exile. but what

 is worse still is, that she has lost her beauty and has become horribly ugly."

"well, handsome or ugly," replied candide, "i am a man of honour, and it is my duty to love her still. but how came she to be reduced to so abject a state with the five or six millions that you took to her?"

"ah!" said cacambo, "was i not to give two millions to senor don fernando d'ibaraa, y figueora, y mascarenes, y lampourdos, y souza, governor of buenos ayres, for permitting miss cunegonde to come away? and did[pg 150] not a corsair bravely rob us of all the rest? did not this corsair carry us to cape matapan, to milo, to nicaria, to samos, to petra, to the dardanelles, to marmora, to scutari? cunegonde and the old woman serve the prince i now mentioned to you, and i am slave to the dethroned sultan."

"what a se

re here, he could tell."

"i know not," said martin, "in what sort of scales your pangloss would weigh the misfortunes of mankind and set a just estimate on their sorrows. all that i can presume to say is, that there are millions of people upon earth who have a hundred times more to complain of than king charles edward, the emperor ivan, or the sultan achmet."

"that may well be," said candide.

in a few days they reached the bosphorus,[pg 151] and candide began by paying a very high ransom for cacambo. then without losing time, he and his companions went on board a galley, in order to search on the banks of the propontis for his cunegonde, however ugly she might have become.

among the crew there were two slaves who rowed very badly, and to whose bare shoulders the levantine captain would now and then apply blows from a bull's pizzle. candide, from a natural impulse, looked at these two slaves more attentively than at the other oarsmen, and approached them with pity. their features though gr

eatly disfigured, had a slight resemblance to those of pangloss and the unhappy jesuit and westphalian baron, brother to miss cunegonde. this moved and saddened him. he looked at them still more attentively.

"indeed," said he to cacambo, "if i had not seen master pangloss hanged, and if i had not had the misfortune to kill the baron, i should think it was they that were rowing."

at the names of the baron and of pangloss, the two galley-slaves uttered a loud cry, held fast by the seat, and let drop their oars. the captain ran up to them and redoubled his blows with the bull's pizzle.

"stop! stop! sir," cried candide. "i will give you what money you please."[pg 152]

"what! it is candide!" said one of the slaves.

"what! it is

pon the first proposal made by candide, however, the levantine captain had already tacked about, and made the crew ply their oars quicker than a bird cleaves the air.

candide embraced the baron and pangloss a hundred times.

"and how happened it, my dear baron, that[pg 153] i did not kill you? and, my dear pangloss, how came you to life again after being hanged? and why are you both in a turkish galley?"

"and it is true that my dear sister is in this country?" said the baron.

"yes," answered cacambo.

"then i behold, once more, my dear candide," cried pangloss.

candide presented martin and cacambo to them; they embraced each other, and all spoke at once. the galley flew; they were already in the port. instantly candide sent for a jew, to whom he sold for fifty thousand sequins a diamond worth a hundred thousand, though the fellow swore to him by abraham that he could give him no more. he immediately paid the ransom for the baron and pangloss. the latter threw himself at the feet of his de

liverer, and bathed them with his tears; the former thanked him with a nod, and promised to return him the money on the first opportunity.

"but is it indeed possible that my sister can be in turkey?" said he.

"nothing is more possible," said cacambo, "since she scours the dishes in the service of a transylvanian prince."

candide sent directly for two jews and sold them some more diamonds, and then they all set out together in another galley to deliver cunegonde from slavery.[pg 154]

what happened to candide, cunegonde, pangloss, martin, etc.

"i ask your pardon once more," said candide to the baron, "your pardon, reverend father, for having run you through the body."

"say no more about it," answered the baron. "i was a little to

, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?"

"i am still of my first opinion," answered pangloss, "for i am a philosopher and i cannot[pg 158] retract, especially as leibnitz could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his plenum and materia subtilis."[pg 159]

how candide found cunegonde and the old woman again.

while candide, the baron, pangloss, martin, and cacambo were relating their several adventures, were reasoning on the contingent or non-contingent events of the universe, disputing on effects and causes, on moral and physical evil, on liberty and necessity, and on the consolations a slave may feel even on a turkish galley, they arrived at the house of the transylvanian prince on the banks of the propontis. the first objects which met their sight were cunegonde and the old woman hanging towels out to dry.

the baron paled at this sight. the tender, l

"thou mayest kill me again," said the baron, "but thou shalt not marry my sister, at least whilst i am living."[pg 161]

the conclusion.

at the bottom of his heart candide had no wish to marry cunegonde. but the extreme impertinence of the baron determined him to conclude the match, and cunegonde pressed him so strongly that he could not go from his word. he consulted pangloss, martin, and the faithful cacambo. pangloss drew up an excellent memorial, wherein he proved that the baron had no right over his sister, and that according to all the laws of the empire, she might marry candide with her left hand. martin was for throwing the baron into the sea; cacambo decided that it would be better to deliver him up again to the captain of the galley, after which they thought to send him back to the general father of the order at rome by the first ship. this advice was well received, the old woman approved i

t; they said not a word to his sister; the thing was executed for a little money, and they had the double pleasure of entrapping a jesuit, and punishing the pride of a german baron.[pg 162]

it is natural to imagine that after so many disasters candide married, and living with the philosopher pangloss, the philosopher martin, the prudent cacambo, and the old woman, having besides brought so many diamonds from the country of the ancient incas, must have led a very happy life. but he was so much imposed upon by the jews that he had nothing left except his small farm; his wife became uglier every day, more peevish and unsupportable; the old woman was infirm and even more fretful than cunegonde. cacambo, who worked in the garden, and took vegetables for sale to constantinople, was fatigued with hard work, and cursed his destiny. pangloss w

saw paquette and friar giroflée land at the farm in extreme misery. they had soon squandered their three thousand piastres, parted, were reconciled, quarrelled again, were thrown[pg 164] into gaol, had escaped, and friar giroflée had at length become turk. paquette continued her trade wherever she went, but made nothing of it.

"i foresaw," said martin to candide, "that your presents would soon be dissipated, and only make them the more miserable. you have rolled in millions of money, you and cacambo; and yet you are not happier than friar giroflée and paquette."

"ha!" said pangloss to paquette, "providence has then brought you amongst us again, my poor child! do you know that you cost me the tip of my nose, an eye, and an ear, as you may see? what a world is this!"

and now this new adventure set them philosophising more than ever.

in the neighbourhood there lived a very famous dervish who was esteemed the best philosopher in all turkey, and they went to consult him. pangloss was the sp
