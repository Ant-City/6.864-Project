Mrs. Alexander - 
            An elderly resident of Randolph Street. A kind lady, Mrs. Alexander lives
                a quiet existence filled by caring for her garden and pet dachshund, Ivor. She
                exhibits grandmotherly tendencies toward Christopher, owing in part to his
                resemblance to her own grandson. She reveals to Christopher important information
                about the affairs of Christopher's father and mother.
