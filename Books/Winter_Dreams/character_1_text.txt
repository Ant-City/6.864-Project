 but a son of fluctuating and feverish warmth, so shaded that it seemed at any moment it would recede and disappear. this color and the mobility of her mouth gave a continual impression of flux, of intense life, of passionate vitality--balanced only partially by the sad luxury of her eyes.

she swung her mashie impatiently and without interest, pitching the ball into a sand-pit on the other side of the green. with a quick, insincere smile and a careless "thank you!" she went on after it.

"that judy jones!" remarked mr. hedrick on the next tee, as they waited--some moments--for her to play on ahead. "all she needs is to be turned up and spanked for six months and then to be married off to an old-fashioned cavalry captain."

"my god, she's good-looking!" said mr. sandwood, who was just over thirty.

"good-looking!" cried mr. hedrick contemptuously, "she always looks as if she wanted to be kissed! turning those big cow-eyes on every calf in town!"

it was doubtful if mr. hedrick intended a referen

was so near now that dexter could see her bathing-suit, which consisted apparently of pink rompers.

the nose of the boat bumped the raft, and as the latter tilted rakishly he was precipitated toward her. with different degrees of interest they recognized each other.

"aren't you one of those men we played through this afternoon?" she demanded.

he was.

"well, do you know how to drive a motor-boat? because if you do i wish you'd drive this one so i can ride on the surf-board behind. my name is judy jones"--she favored him with an absurd smirk--rather, what tried to be a smirk, for, twist her mouth as she might, it was not grotesque, it was merely beautiful--"and i live in a house over there on the island, and in that house there is a man waiting for me. when he drove up at the door i drove out of the dock because he says i'm his ideal."

there was a fish jumping and a star shining and the lights around the lake were gleaming. dexter sat beside judy jones and she explained how her boat was drive

ng board, her arms spread wide, her eyes lifted toward the moon.

"it's awful cold," she shouted. "what's your name?"

he told her.

"well, why don't you come to dinner to-morrow night?"

his heart turned over like the fly-wheel of the boat, and, for the second time, her casual whim gave a new direction to his life.

next evening while he waited for her to come down-stairs, dexter peopled the soft deep summer room and the sun-porch that opened from it with the men who had already loved judy jones. he knew the sort of men they were--the men who when he first went to college had entered from the great prep schools with graceful clothes and the deep tan of healthy summers. he had seen that, in one sense, he was better than these men. he was newer and stronger. yet in acknowledging to himself that he wished his children to be like them he was admitting that he was but the rough, strong stuff from which they eternally sprang.

when the time had come for him to wear good clothes, he had known

 that particular reserve peculiar to his university, that set it off from other universities. he recognized the value to him of such a mannerism and he had adopted it; he knew that to be careless in dress and manner required more confidence than to be careful. but carelessness was for his children. his mother's name had been krimslich. she was a bohemian of the peasant class and she had talked broken english to the end of her days. her son must keep to the set patterns.

at a little after seven judy jones came down-stairs. she wore a blue silk afternoon dress, and he was disappointed at first that she had not put on something more elaborate. this feeling was accentuated when, after a brief greeting, she went to the door of a butler's pantry and pushing it open called: "you can serve dinner, martha." he had rather expected that a butler would announce dinner, that there would be a cocktail. then he put these thoughts behind him as they sat down side by side on a lounge and looked at each other.

 he waited breathless for the experiment, facing the unpredictable compound that would form mysteriously from the elements of their lips. then he saw--she communicated her excitement to him, lavishly, deeply, with kisses that were not a promise but a fulfillment. they aroused in him not hunger demanding renewal but surfeit that would demand more surfeit . . . kisses that were like charity, creating want by holding back nothing at all.

it did not take him many hours to decide that he had wanted judy jones ever since he was a proud, desirous little boy.

it began like that--and continued, with varying shades of intensity, on such a note right up to the d√©nouement. dexter surrendered a part of himself to the most direct and unprincipled personality with which he had ever come in contact. whatever judy wanted, she went after with the full pressure of her charm. there was no divergence of method, no jockeying for position or premeditation of effects--there was a very little mental side to a

er frantically. she told the local beau that she was bored with her visitor, and two days later he left. she was seen with him at the station, and it was reported that he looked very mournful indeed.

on this note the summer ended. dexter was twenty-four, and he found himself increasingly in a position to do as he wished. he joined two clubs in the city and lived at one of them. though he was by no means an integral part of the stag-lines at these clubs, he managed to be on hand at dances where judy jones was likely to appear. he could have gone out socially as much as he liked--he was an eligible young man, now, and popular with down-town fathers. his confessed devotion to judy jones had rather solidified his position. but he had no social aspirations and rather despised the dancing men who were always on tap for the thursday or saturday parties and who filled in at dinners with the younger married set. already he was playing with the idea of going east to new york. he wanted to take judy jones

 with him. no disillusion as to the world in which she had grown up could cure his illusion as to her desirability.

remember that--for only in the light of it can what he did for her be understood.

eighteen months after he first met judy jones he became engaged to another girl. her name was irene scheerer, and her father was one of the men who had always believed in dexter. irene was light-haired and sweet and honorable, and a little stout, and she had two suitors whom she pleasantly relinquished when dexter formally asked her to marry him.

summer, fall, winter, spring, another summer, another fall--so much he had given of his active life to the incorrigible lips of judy jones. she had treated him with interest, with encouragement,

able agony of spirit. she had caused him untold inconvenience and not a little trouble. she had insulted him, and she had ridden over him, and she had played his interest in her against his interest in his work--for fun. she had done everything to him except to criticise him--this she had not done--it seemed to him only because it might have sullied the utter indifference she manifested and sincerely felt toward him.

when autumn had come and gone again it occurred to him that he could not have judy jones. he had to beat this into his mind but he convinced himself at last. he lay awake at night for a while and argued it over. he told himself the trouble and the pain she had caused him, he enumerated her glaring deficiencies as a wife. then he said to himself that he loved her, and after a while he fell asleep. for a week, lest he imagined her husky voice over the telephone or her eyes opposite him at lunch, he worked hard and late, and at night he went to his office and plotted out his years.

oung and already fabulously successful dexter green--should know more about such things.

that was in october, when he was twenty-five. in january, dexter and irene became engaged. it was to be announced in june, and they were to be married three months later.

the minnesota winter prolonged itself interminably, and it was almost may when the winds came soft and the snow ran down into black bear lake at last. for the first time in over a year dexter was enjoying a certain tranquility of spirit. judy jones had been in florida, and afterward in hot springs, and somewhere she had been engaged, and somewhere she had broken it off. at first, when dexter had definitely given her up, it had made him sad that people still linked them together and asked for news of her, but when he began to be placed at dinner next to irene scheerer people didn't ask him about her any more--they told him about her. he ceased to be an authority on her.

may at last. dexter walked the streets at night when the darkness was

ious, i--"

"oh, no. she's going to play golf with you in the morning. you can spare her for just one night, can't you, dexter?"

her smile was kind. she and dexter liked each other. in the living-room he talked for a moment before he said good-night.

returning to the university club, where he had rooms, he stood in the doorway for a moment and watched the dancers. he leaned against the door-post, nodded at a man or two--yawned.

"hello, darling."

the familiar voice at his elbow startled him. judy jones had left a man and crossed the room to him--judy jones, a slender enamelled doll in cloth of gold: gold in a band at her head, gold in two slipper points at her dress's hem. the fragile glow of her face seemed to blossom as she smiled at him. a breeze of warmth and light blew through the room. his hands in the pockets of his dinner-jacket tightened spasmodically. he was filled with a sudden excitement.

"when did you get back?" he asked casually.

"come here and i'll tell you about it."

ho had befriended him. there was nothing sufficiently pictorial about irene's grief to stamp itself on his mind.

dexter was at bottom hard-minded. the attitude of the city on his action was of no importance to him, not because he was going to leave the city, but because any outside attitude on the situation seemed superficial. he was completely indifferent to popular opinion. nor, when he had seen that it was no use, that he did not possess in himself the power to move fundamentally or to hold judy jones, did he bear any malice toward her. he loved her, and he would love her until the day he was too old for loving--but he could not have her. so he tasted the deep pain that is reserved only for the strong, just as he had tasted for a little while the deep happiness.

even the ultimate falsity of the grounds upon which judy terminated the engagement that she did not want to "take him away" from irene--judy, who had wanted nothing else--did not revolt him. he was beyond any revulsion or any amusem

siness way, and then and there this incident occurred, and closed out, so to speak, this particular side of his life.

"so you're from the middle west," said the man devlin with careless curiosity. "that's funny--i thought men like you were probably born and raised on wall street. you know--wife of one of my best friends in detroit came from your city. i was an usher at the wedding."

dexter waited with no apprehension of what was coming.

"judy simms," said devlin with no particular interest; "judy jones she was once."

"yes, i knew her." a dull impatience spread over him. he had heard, of course, that she was married--perhaps deliberately he had heard no more.

"awfully nice girl," brooded devlin meaninglessly, "i'm sort of sorry for her."

"why?" something in dexter was alert, receptive, at once.

"oh, lud simms has gone to pieces in a way. i don't mean he ill-uses her, but he drinks and runs around--"

"doesn't she run around?"

"no. stays at home with her kids."

"oh."

"she's a little too

r. "why, man, she's only twenty-seven."

he was possessed with a wild notion of rushing out into the streets and taking a train to detroit. he rose to his feet spasmodically.

"i guess you're busy," devlin apologized quickly. "i didn't realize--"

"no, i'm not busy," said dexter, steadying his voice. "i'm not busy at all. not busy at all. did you say she was--twenty-seven? no, i said she was twenty-seven."

"yes, you did," agreed devlin dryly.

"go on, then. go on."

"what do you mean?"

"about judy jones."

devlin looked at him helplessly.

"well, that's--i told you all there is to it. he treats her like the devil. oh, they're not going to get divorced or anything. when he's particularly outrageous she forgives him. in fact, i'm inclined to think she loves him. she was a pretty girl when she first came to detroit."

a pretty girl! the phrase struck dexter as ludicrous.

"isn't she--a pretty girl, any more?"

"oh, she's all right."

"look here," said dexter, sitting down suddenly, "i don't under

stand. you say she was a 'pretty girl' and now you say she's 'all right.' i don't understand what you mean--judy jones wasn't a pretty girl, at all. she was a great beauty. why, i knew her, i knew her. she was--"

devlin laughed pleasantly.

"i'm not trying to start a row," he said. "i think judy's a nice girl and i like her. i can't understand how a man like lud simms could fall madly in love with her, but he did." then he added: "most of the women like her."

dexter looked closely at devlin, thinking wildly that there must be a reason for this, some insensitivity in the man or some private malice.

life he felt like getting very drunk. he knew that he was laughing loudly at something devlin had said, but he did not know what it was or why it was funny. when, in a few minutes, devlin went he lay down on his lounge and looked out the window at the new york sky-line into which the sun was sinking in dull lovely shades of pink and gold.

he had thought that having nothing else to lose he was invulnerable at last--but he knew that he had just lost something more, as surely as if he had married judy jones and seen her fade away before his eyes.

the dream was gone. something had been taken from him. in a sort of panic he pushed the palms of his hands into his eyes and tried to bring up a picture of the waters lapping on sherry island and the moonlit veranda, and gingham on the golf-links and the dry sun and the gold color of her neck's soft down. and her mouth damp to his kisses and her eyes plaintive with melancholy and her freshness like new fine linen in the morning. why, these things were no
