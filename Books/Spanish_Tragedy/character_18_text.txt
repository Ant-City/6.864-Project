[prologue]

                enter the ghost of andrea, and with him revenge.

  ghost.  when this eternal substance of my soul
    did live imprison'd in my wanton flesh,
    each in their function serving others' need,
    i was a courtier in the spanish court:
    my name

 minority are like women in
their uncertainty; that they are most forbidden, they will soonest
attempt; so i now.  by my bare honesty, here's nothing but the bare
empty box!  were it not sin against secrecy, i would say it were a
piece of gentlemanlike knavery.  i must go to pedringano and tell him
his pardon is in this box!  nay, i would have sworn it, had i not
seen the contrary.  i cannot choose but smile to think how the villain
will flout the gallows, scorn the audience, and descant on the hangman,
and all presuming of his pardon from hence.  will't not be an odd jest,
for me to stand and grace every jest he makes, pointing my finger at
this box, as who should say:  "mock on, here's thy warrant!"  is't not
a scurvy jest that a man should jest himself to death?  alas, poor
pedringano! i am in a sort sorry for thee, but, if i should be hanged
with thee, i could not weep.

                exit.

    dispatch!  the fault approved and confess'd,
    and by our law he is condemn'd to die.

  hang.  come on, sir!  are you ready?

  ped.  to do what, my fine officious knave?

  hang.  to go to this gear.

  ped.  o, sir, you are to forward; thou wouldst fain
    furnish me with a halter, to disfurnish me of my habit.
    so should i go out of this gear, my raiment, into that
    gear, the rope.  but, hangman, now i spy your knavery, i'll
    not change without boot; that's flat.

  hang.  come, sir.

  ped. so then i must up?

  hang.  no remedy.

  ped.  yes, but there shall be for my coming down.

  hang.  indeed here's a remedy for that.

  ped. how?  be turn'd off?

  hang. aye, truly.  come, are you ready?
    i pray you, sir, dispatch, the day goes away.

  ped.  what, do you hang by the hour?  if you do, i
    may chance to break your old custom.

  hang.  faith, you have no reason, for i am

  ped.  dost thou mock me, hangman?  pray god i be not
    preserved to break your knaves-pate for this!

  hang.  alas, sir, you are a foot too low to reach it, and i
    hope you will never grow so high while i am in office.

  ped.  sirrah, dost see yonder boy with the box in his
    hand?

  hang.  what, he that points to it with his finger?

  ped.  aye, that companion.

  hang.  i know him not; but what of him?

  ped.  dost thou think to live till his old doublet will
    make thee a new truss?

  hang.  aye, and many a f

    an honester man then either thou or he.

  ped.  what hath he in his box, as thou thinkst?

  hang.  faith, i cannot tell, nor i care not greatly.
    me thinks you should rather hearken to your soul's health.

  ped.  why, sirrah hangman, i take it that that is good for
    the body is likewise good for the soul:  and it may be in
    that box is balm for both.

  hang.  well, thou art even the merriest piece of man's
    flesh that e'er groaned at my office-door.

  ped.  is your roguery become an office, with a knave's
    name?

  hang.  aye, and that shall all they witness that see you seal
    it with a thief's name.

  ped.  i prithee, request this good company to pray for
    me.

  hang.  aye, marry, sir, this is a good

of my tears,
    and broken through the brazen gates of hell;
    yet still tormented is my tortur'd soul
    with broken sighs and restless passions,
    that, winged, mount, and hovering in the air,
    beat at the windows of the brightest heav'ns,
    soliciting for justice and revenge.
    but they are plac'd in those empyreal heights,
    where, countermur'd with walls of diamond,
    i find the place impregnable, and they
    resist my woes and give my words no way.

                enter hangman with a letter.

  hang.  o lord, sir!  god bless you, sir!  the man, sir,--
    petergade, sir:  he that was so full of merry conceits--

  hier.  well, what of him?

  hang.  o lord, sir!  he went the wrong way; the fellow
    had a fair commission to the contrary.  sir, here is his
    passport, i pray you, sir;  we have done him wrong.

  hiero.  i warrant thee; give it me.

  hang.  you will stand between the gallows and me?

  hiero. aye, aye!

  hang.  i thank your lord's worship.

  hiero.  and yet, though somewhat nearer me concerns
    i will, to ease the grief that i sustain,
    take truce with sorrow while i read on this.
