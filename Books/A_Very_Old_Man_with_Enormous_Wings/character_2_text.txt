d light, had become a stew of mud and rotten shellfish. the light was so weak at noon that when pelayo was coming back to the house after throwing away the crabs, it was hard for him to see what it was that was moving and groaning in the rear of the courtyard. he had to go very close to see that it was an old man, a very old man, lying face down in the mud, who, in spite of his tremendous efforts, couldn’t get up, impeded by his enormous wings.

frightened by that nightmare, pelayo ran to get elisenda, his wife, who was putting compresses on the sick child, and he took her to the rear of the courtyard. they both looked at the fallen body with a mute stupor. he was dressed like a ragpicker. there were only a few faded hairs left on his bald skull and very few teeth in his mouth, and his pitiful condition of a drenched great-grandfather took away any sense of grandeur he might have had. his huge buzzard wings, dirty and half-plucked, were forever entangled in the mud. they looked at him so lon

g and so closely that pelayo and elisenda very soon overcame their surprise and in the end found him familiar. then they dared speak to him, and he answered in an incomprehensible dialect with a strong sailor’s voice. that was how they skipped over the inconvenience of the wings and quite intelligently concluded that he was a lonely castaway from some foreign ship wrecked by the storm. and yet, they called in a neighbor woman who knew everything about life and death to see him, and all she needed was one look to show them their mista

d-blood angel was held captive in pelayo’s house. against the judgment of the wise neighbor woman, for whom angels in those times were the fugitive survivors of a celestial conspiracy, they did not have the heart to club him to death. pelayo watched over him all afternoon from the kitchen, armed with his bailiff’s club, and before going to bed he dragged him out of the mud and locked him up with the hens in the wire chicken coop. in the middle of the night, when the rain stopped, pelayo and elisenda were still killing crabs. a short time afterward the child woke up without a fever and with a desire to eat. then they felt magnanimous and decided to put the angel on a raft with fresh water and provisions for three days and leave him to his fate on the high seas. but when they went out into the courtyard with the first light of dawn, they found the whole neighborhood in front of the chicken coop having fun with the angel, without the slightest reverence, tossing him things to eat through the

 of angels. nevertheless, he promised to write a letter to his bishop so that the latter would write his primate so that the latter would write to the supreme pontiff in order to get the final verdict from the highest courts.

his prudence fell on sterile hearts. the news of the captive angel spread with such rapidity that after a few hours the courtyard had the bustle of a marketplace and they had to call in troops with fixed bayonets to disperse the mob that was about to knock the house down. elisenda, her spine all twisted from sweeping up so much marketplace trash, then got the idea of fencing in the yard and charging five cents admission to see the angel.

the curious came from far away. a traveling carnival arrived with a flying acrobat who buzzed over the crowd several times, but no one paid any attention to him because his wings were not those of an angel but, rather, those of a sidereal bat. the most unfortunate invalids on earth came in search of health: a poor woman who since childh

ood has been counting her heartbeats and had run out of numbers; a portuguese man who couldn’t sleep because the noise of the stars disturbed him; a sleepwalker who got up at night to undo the things he had done while awake; and many others with less serious ailments. in the midst of that shipwreck disorder that made the earth tremble, pelayo and elisenda were happy with fatigue, for in less than a week they had crammed their rooms with money and the line of pilgrims waiting their turn to enter still reached beyond the horizon.

the angel was the only one who took no part in his own act. he spent his time trying to get comfortable in his borrowed nest, befuddled by the hellish heat of the oil lamps and sacramental candles that had been placed along the wire. at first they tried to make him eat some mothballs, which, according to the wisdom of th

layo’s courtyard went back to being as empty as during the time it had rained for three days and crabs walked through the bedrooms.

the owners of the house had no reason to lament. with the money they saved they built a two-story mansion with balconies and gardens and high netting so that crabs wouldn’t get in during the winter, and with iron bars on the windows so that angels wouldn’t get in. pelayo also set up a rabbit warren close to town and gave up his job as a bailiff for good, and elisenda bought some satin pumps with high heels and many dresses of iridescent silk, the kind worn on sunday by the most desirable women in those times. the chicken coop was the only thing that didn’t receive any attention. if they washed it down with creolin and burned tears of myrrh inside it every so often, it was not in homage to the angel but to drive away the dungheap stench that still hung everywhere like a ghost and was turning the new house into an old one. at first, when the child learned t

when the child began school it had been some time since the sun and rain had caused the collapse of the chicken coop. the angel went dragging himself about here and there like a stray dying man. they would drive him out of the bedroom with a broom and a moment later find him in the kitchen. he seemed to be in so many places at the same time that they grew to think that he’d be duplicated, that he was reproducing himself all through the house, and the exasperated and unhinged elisenda shouted that it was awful living in that hell full of angels. he could scarcely eat and his antiquarian eyes had also become so foggy that he went about bumping into posts. all he had left were the bare cannulae of his last feathers. pelayo threw a blanket over him and extended him the charity of letting him sleep in the shed, and only then did they notice that he had a temperature at night, and was delirious with the tongue twisters of an old norwegian. that was one of the few times they becam

sunny days. he remained motionless for several days in the farthest corner of the courtyard, where no one would see him, and at the beginning of december some large, stiff feathers began to grow on his wings, the feathers of a scarecrow, which looked more like another misfortune of decreptitude. but he must have known the reason for those changes, for he was quite careful that no one should notice them, that no one should hear the sea chanteys that he sometimes sang under the stars. one morning elisenda was cutting some bunches of onions for lunch when a wind that seemed to come from the high seas blew into the kitchen. then she went to the window and caught the angel in his first attempts at flight. they were so clumsy that his fingernails opened a furrow in the vegetable patch and he was on the point of knocking the shed down with the ungainly flapping that slipped on the light and couldn’t get a grip on the air. but he did manage to gain altitude. elisenda let out a sigh of relief, for he
