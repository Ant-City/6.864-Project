Willie Oban - 
      A man in his thirties who left Harvard Law School upon the ruin of his prominent industrialist father. Willie dreams of starting his legal career and he speaks with "mocking suavity." Dressed in paper-thin rags, he shudders continually in his drunken stupor, his eyelids fluttering "as if any light were too strong for his eyes."
