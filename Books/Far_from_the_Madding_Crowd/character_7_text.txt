frequently filled the post of head godfather in baptisms

"ay -- that i will, 'tis my only doctor." replied mr.
clark, who, twenty years younger than jan coggan,
revolved in the same orbit. he secreted mirth on all
occasions for special discharge at popular parties.
"why, joseph poorgrass, ye han't had a drop!" said
mr. coggan to a self-conscious man in the background,
thrusting the cup towards him.
"such a modest man as he is!" said jacob smallbury.
"why, ye've hardly had strength of eye enough to look
in our young mis'ess's face, so i hear, joseph?"
all looked at joseph poorgrass with pitying reproach.
"no -- i've hardly looked at her at all." simpered
joseph, reducing his body smaller whilst talking,
apparently from a meek sense of undue prominence.
"and when i seed

"poor feller." said mr. clark.
"'tis a curious nature for a man." said jan coggan.
"yes." continued joseph poorgrass -- his shyness,
which was so painful as a defect, filling him with a
mild complacency now that it was regarded as an
interesting study. "'twere blush, blush, blush with
me every minute of the time, when she was speaking
to me."
"i believe ye, joseph poorgrass, for we all know ye
to be a very bashful man."
"'tis a' awkward gift for a man, poor soul." said the
maltster. "and ye have suffered from it a long time,
we know."
"ay ever since i was a boy. yes -- mother was
concerned to her heart about it -- yes. but twas all
nought."
"did ye ever go into the world to try and stop it,
joseph poorgrass?"
"oh ay, tried all sorts o' company. they took me
to greenhill fair, and into a great gay jerry-go-nimble
show, where there were women-folk riding

coggan, with an impassive face, implying that a true
narrative, like time and tide, must run its course and
would respect no man. "and as he was coming along
in the middle of the night, much afeared, and not able
to find his way out of the trees nohow, 'a cried out,
"man-a-lost! man-a-lost!" a owl in a tree happened
to be crying "whoo-whoo-whoo!" as owls do, you
know, shepherd" (gabriel nodded), " and joseph, all
in a tremble, said, " joseph poorgrass, of weatherbury,
sir!"
"no, no, now -- that's too much!" said the timid
man, becoming a man of brazen courage all of a sudden.
"i didn't say sir. i'll tike my oath i didn't say " joseph

of her as his sweetheart."
  "used to kiss her scores and long-hundreds o times,

  "he was very proud of her, too, when they were
married, as i've been told." said the maltster.
  "ay." said coggan. "he admired her so much that
he used to light the candle three time a night to look
at her."
  "boundless love; i shouldn't have supposed it in the
universe!" murmered joseph poorgrass, who habitually
spoke on a large scale in his moral reflections.
  "well, to be sure." said gabriel.

woman both well. levi everdene -- that was the man's

of a higher circle of life than that -- 'a was a gentleman-

a very celebrated bankrupt two or three times."

joseph.

not married to him at all. and as soon as he could
thoroughly fancy he was doing wrong and committing

  "well, 'twas a most ungodly remedy." murmured
joseph poorgrass; "but we ought to feel deep cheerful-

worse. you see, he might have gone the bad road and
given his eyes to unlawfulness entirely -- yes, gross un-
lawfulness, so to say it."

  "he can blow the flute very well -- that 'a can." said
a young married man, who having no individuality worth
mentioning was known as "susan tall's husband." he
continued, "i'd as lief as not be able to blow into a
flute as well-as that."
  "he's a clever man, and 'tis a true comfort for us to
have such a shepherd." murmured joseph poorgrass, in
a soft cadence. "we ought to feel full o' thanksgiving
that he's not a player of ba'dy songs 'instead of these
merry tunes; for 'twould have been just as easy for god
to have made the shepherd a loose low man -- a man of
iniquity, so to speak it -- as what he is. yes, for our wives"
and daughters' sakes we should feel real thanks giving."
  "true, true, -- real thanksgiving!" dashed in mark

additional criticism of gabriel's countenance, the latter
person jerking out, with the ghastly grimace required by
the instrument, the chorus of "dame durden!
  "i hope you don't mind that young man's bad
manners in naming your features?" whispered joseph to
gabriel.
  "not at all." said mr. oak.
  "for by nature ye be a very handsome man,

sauvity.
  "ay, that ye be, shepard." said the company.
  "thank you very much." said oak, in the modest
tone good manners demanded, thinking, however, that
he would never let bathsheba see him playing the
flute; in this severe showing a discretion equal to that
related to its sagacious inventress, the divine minerva
herself.

henery appeared in a drab kerseymere great-coat,
buttoned over his smock-frock, the white skirts of the
latter being visible to the distance of about a foot below
the coat-tails, which, when you got used to the style of
dress, looked natural enough, and even ornamental -- it
certainly was comfortable.
matthew moon, joseph poorgrass, and other carters
and waggoners followed at his heels, with great lanterns
dangling from their hands, which showed that they had
just come from the cart-horse stables, where they had
been busily engaged since four o'clock that morning.
"and how is she getting on without a baily?" the
maltster inquired.
henery shook his head, and smiled one of the bitter
smiles, dragging all the flesh of his forehead into a
corrugated heap in the centre.

"good works good pay, so to speak it." attested

henery turned and blew out the lanterns, which the
increase of daylight rendered no longer necessary even
in the malthouse, with its one pane of glass.

oak appeared in the entry with a steaming face, hay-
bands wound about his ankles to keep out the snow, a
leather strap round his waist outside the smock-frock,
and looking altogether an epitome of the world's health
and vigour. four lambs hung in various embarrassing
attitudes over his shoulders, and the dog george, whom
gabriel had contrived to fetch from norcombe, stalked
solemnly behind.
"well, shepherd oak, and how's lambing this year,

"terrible trying," said oak. "i've been wet through

of yours -- about miss everdene. i don't allow it. do
you hear? "
"with all my heart, as i've got no chance." replied
mr. clark, cordially.
"i suppose you've been speaking against her?" said
oak, turning to joseph poorgrass with a very grim
look.
"no, no -- not a word i -- 'tis a real joyful thing that
she's no worse, that's what i say." said joseph, trembling
and blushing with terror. "matthew just said --  -- "

the dog george looked up at the same time after the
shepherd's menace, and though he understood english
but imperfectly, began to growl.
"now, don't ye take on so, shepherd, and sit down!"
said henery, with a deprecating peacefulness equal to
anything of the kind in christianity.
"we hear that ye be a extraordinary good and
clever man, shepherd." said joseph poorgrass with
considerable anxiety from behind the maltster's bed-
stead whither he had retired for safety. "'tis a great
thing to be clever, i'm sure." he added, making move-
ments associated with states of mind rather than body;
"we wish we were, don't we, neighbours?"
"ay, that we do, sure." said matthew moon, with
a small anxious laugh towards oak, to show how very
friendly disposed he was likewise.

how absolute was the fact that he couldn't. "and so

joseph?" matthew marked on the dusty floor with his
whip-handle.

the fact that they were born. their noise increased to a
chorus of baas, upon which oak pulled the milk-can from
before the fire, and taking a small tea-pot from the pocket
of his smock-frock, filled it with milk, and taught those of
the helpless creatures which were not to be restored to
their dams how to drink from the spout -- a trick they
acquired with astonishing aptitude.
"and she don't even let ye have the skins of the
dead lambs, i hear?" resumed joseph poorgrass, his
eyes lingering on the operations of oak with the neces-
sary melancholy.
"i don't have them." said gabriel.
"ye be very badly used, shepherd." hazarded joseph
again, in the hope of getting oak as an ally in lamenta-
tion after all. "i think she's took against ye -- that
i do."
"o no -- not at all." replied gabriel, hastily, and a
sigh escaped him, which the deprivation of lamb skins
could hardly have caused.

troubles in the fold -- a message


gabriel oak had ceased to feed the weatherbury
flock for about four-and-twenty hours, when on sunday
afternoon the elderly gentlemen joseph poorgrass,
matthew moon, fray, and half-a-dozen others, came
running up to the house of the mistress of the upper
farm.
 "whatever is the matter, men?" she said, meeting
them at the door just as she was coming out on her
way to church, and ceasing in a moment from the close
compression of her two red lips, with which she had
accompanied the exertion of pulling on a tight glove.
"sixty!" said joseph poorgrass.
"seventy!" said moon.
"fifty-nine!" said susan tall's husband.

"-- and got into a field of young clover." said tall.

"and they be getting blasted." said henery fray.
"that they be." said joseph.
"and will all die as dead as nits, if they bain't got
out and cured!"said tall.
joseph's countenance was drawn into lines and
puckers by his concern. fray's forehead was wrinkled
both perpendicularly and crosswise, after the pattern of
a portcullis, expressive of a double despair. laban
tall's lips were thin, and his face were rigid. matthew's
jaws sank, and his eyes turned whichever way the
strongest musc

be done in a particular spot. if ye go to the right or

"then they must die." she said, in a resigned tone.
"only one man in the neighbourhood knows the way,"
said joseph, now just come up. "he could cure 'em
all if he were here."
"who is he? let's get him!"
"shepherd oak," said matthew. "ah, he's a clever
man in talents!"
"ah, that he is so!" said joseph poorgrass.
"true -- he's the man." said laban tall.
"how dare you name that man in my presence!" she
said excitedly. "i told you never to allude to him, nor
shall you if you stay with me. ah!" she added, brighten-
ing, "farmer boldwood knows!"
  "o no, ma'am" said matthew. "two of his store

from the softer impressions produced by bathsheba's
voice, the shearers rose to leave, coggan turning to

"i like to give praise where praise is due, and the
man deserves it -- that 'a do so." he remarked, looking at
the worthy thief, as if he were the masterpiece of some
world-renowned artist.
"i'm sure i should never have believed it if we hadn't
proved it, so to allude," hiccupped joseph poorgrass, "that
every cup, every one of the best knives and forks, and
every empty bottle be in their place as perfect now as
at the beginning, and not one stole at all.
"i'm sure i don't deserve half the praise you give
me." said the virtuous thief, grimly.
"well, i'll say this for pennyways." added coggan,
"that whenever he do really make up his mind to do a

said cain ball, looking reproachfully at oak, with eyes
drenched in their own dew.

said jan coggan, lifting a flagon of cider, pulling out
the cork, and applying the hole to cainy's mouth;
joseph poorgrass in the meantime beginning to think
apprehensively of the serious consequences that would
follow cainy ball's strangulation in his cough, and the
history of his bath adventures dying with him.
"for my poor self, i always say "please god" afore
i do anything." said joseph, in an unboastful voice; "and

"white as a lily? you are sure 'twas she?

"well, what besides?"
"great glass windows to the shops, and great clouds

coggan.

boy's meaning is that the sky and the earth in the
kingdom of bath is not altogether different from ours

cities, and as such the boy's words should be suffered,

as the clock over the south-street alms-house pointed
to five minutes to three, a blue spring waggon, picked
out with red, and containing boughs and flowers, passed
the end of the street, and up towards this side of the
building. whilst the chimes were yet stammering out
a shattered form of "malbrook." joseph poorgrass rang
the bell, and received directions to back his waggon
against the high door under the gable. the door then
opened, and a plain elm coffin was slowly thrust forth,
and laid by two men in fustian along the middle of the
vehicle.
one of the men then stepped up beside it, took from
his pocket a lump of chalk, and wrote upon the cover
the name and a few other words in a large scrawling
hand. (we believe that they do these things more
tenderly now, and provide a plate.) he covered the

perceptible motion in the
air, not a visible drop of water fell upon a leaf of the
beeches, birches, and firs composing the wood on either
side. the trees stood in an attitude of intentness, as if
they waited longingly for a wind to come and rock
them. a startling quiet overhung all surrounding things
 -- so completely, that the crunching of the waggon-
wheels was as a great noise, and small rustles, which
had never obtained a hearing except by night, were dis-
tinctly individualized.
joseph poorgrass looked round upon his sad burden
as it loomed faintly through the flowering laurustinus,
then at the unfathomable gloom amid the high trees on
each hand, indistinct, shadowless, and spectrelike in
their monochrome of grey. he felt anything but cheer-
ful, and wished he had the company even of a child or
dog. stopping the home, he listened. not a footstep
or wheel was audible anywhere around, and the dead
silence was broken only by a heavy particle falling from
a tree through the evergr

turn after that? no, i'll stick to my side; and if we
be in the wrong, so be it:  i'll fall with the fallen!"
"well said -- very well said." observed joseph. --
"however, folks, i must be moving now: upon my life
i must. pa'son thirdly will be waiting at the church
gates, and there's the woman a-biding outside in the
waggon."
"joseph poorgrass, don't be so miserable! pa'son
thirdly won't mind. he's a generous man; he's found
me in tracts for years, and i've consumed a good many
in the course of a long and shady life; but he's never
been the man to cry out at the expense. sit down."
the longer joseph poorgrass remained, the less his
spirit was troubled by the duties which devolved upon
him this afternoon. the minutes glided by uncounted,
until the evening shades began perceptibly to deepen,
and the eyes of the three were but

"yes; i see two of every sort, as if i were some holy
man living in the times of king noah and entering
into the ark.... y-y-y-yes." he added, becoming much
affected by the picture of himself as a person thrown
away, and shedding tears; "i feel too good for england:
i ought to have lived in genesis by rights, like the other
men of sacrifice, and then i shouldn't have b-b-been

oon as the tent was completed the band struck
up highly stimulating harmonies, and the announce-
ment was publicly made, black bess standing in a con-
spicuous position on the outside, as a living proof, if
proof were wanted, of the truth of the oracular utterances
from the stage over which the people were to enter.
these were so convinced by such genuine appeals to
heart and understanding both that they soon began to
crowd in abundantly, among the foremost being visible
jan coggan and joseph poorgrass, who were holiday
keeping here to-day,
"'that's the great ruffen pushing me!" screamed a
woman in front of jan over her shoulder at him when
the rush was at its fiercest.
"how can i help pushing ye when the folk behind
push me?" said coggan, in a deprecating tone, turning
without turning his body, which was jammed as in a vice.
there was a silence; then the drums and trumpets
again sent forth their echoing notes. the crowd was
again ecstasied, and gave another lurch in which coggan
