hemselves, finding her
pleasure so.

in her person she was rather small and delicate, with a large brow, and
dropping bunches of brown silk curls. her blue eyes were very straight,
honest, and searching. she had the beautiful hands of the coppards.
her dress was always subdued. she wore dark blue silk, with a peculiar
silver chain of silver scallops. this, and a heavy brooch of twisted
gold, was her only ornament. she was still perfectly intact, deeply
religious, and full of beautiful candour.

walter morel seemed melted away before her. she was to the miner that
thing of mystery and fascination, a lady. when she spoke to him, it was
with a southern pronunciation and a purity of english which thrilled
him to hear. she watched him. he danced well, as if it were natural and
joyous in him to dance. his grandfather was a french refugee who had
married an english barmaid--if it had been a marriage. gertrude coppard
watched the young miner as he danced, a certain subtle exultation like
glamour in his mo

mrs. morel could see the naked forms of boys flashing round the
deep yellow water, or an occasional bright figure dart glittering over
the blackish stagnant meadow. she knew william was at the dipping-hole,
and it was the dread of her life lest he should get drowned. annie
played under the tall old hedge, picking up alder cones, that she called
currants. the child required much attention, and the flies were teasing.

the children were put to bed at seven o’clock. then she worked awhile.

when walter morel and jerry arrived at bestwood they felt a load off
their minds; a railway journey no longer impended, so they could put the
finishing touches to a glorious day. they entered the nelson with the
satisfaction of returned travellers.

the next day was a work-day, and the thought of it put a damper on the
men’s spirits. most of them, moreover, had spent their money. some were
already rolling dismally home, to sleep in preparation for the morrow.
mrs. morel, listening to their mournful singing, we

mrs. morel knew him too well to look at him. as she unfastened her
brooch at the mirror, she smiled faintly to see her face all smeared
with the yellow dust of lilies. she brushed it off, and at last lay
down. for some time her mind continued snapping and jetting sparks,
but she was asleep before her husband awoke from the first sleep of his
drunkenness.



chapter ii

the birth of paul, and another battle

after such a scene as the last, walter morel was for some days abashed
and ashamed, but he soon regained his old bullying indifference. yet
there was a slight shrinking, a diminishing in his assurance. physically
even, he shrank, and his fine full presence waned. he never grew in the
least stout, so that, as he sank from his erect, assertive bearing, his
physique seemed to contract along with his pride and moral strength.

but now he realised how hard it was for his wife to drag about at her
work, and, his sympathy quickened by penitence,

again, ashamed almost of her impulse to give him back again whence he
came.

“if he lives,” she thought to herself, “what will become of him--what
will he be?”

her heart was anxious.

“i will call him paul,” she said suddenly; she knew not why.

after a while she went home. a fine shadow was flung over the deep green
meadow, darkening all.

as she expected, she found the house empty. but morel was home by ten
o’clock, and that day, at least, ended peacefully.

walter morel was, at this time, exceedingly irritable. his work seemed
to exhaust him. when he came home he did not speak civilly to anybody.
if the fire were rather low he bullied about that; he grumbled about his
dinner; if the children made a chatter he shouted at them in a way that
made their mother’s blood boil, and made them hate him.

on the friday, he was not home by eleven o’clock. the baby was unwell,
and was restless, crying if he were put down. mrs. morel, tired to
death, and still weak, was

 fireplace. she swayed, almost fell stunned from her chair. to her
very soul she was sick; she clasped the child tightly to her bosom. a
few moments elapsed; then, with an effort, she brought herself to.
the baby was crying plaintively. her left brow was bleeding rather
profusely. as she glanced down at the child, her brain reeling, some
drops of blood soaked into its white shawl; but the baby was at least
not hurt. she balanced her head to keep equilibrium, so that the blood
ran into her eye.

walter morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table with one
hand, looking blank. when he was sufficiently sure of his balance,
he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back of her
rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward over her,
and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering concern:

“did it catch thee?”

he swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child. with the
catastrophe he had lost all balance.

“go away,” she said, struggling to keep her p

d her head.

“let me tie it for thee,” he said humbly.

“i can do it myself,” she replied. when it was done she went upstairs,
telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.

in the morning mrs. morel said:

“i knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when i was getting a
raker in the dark, because the candle blew out.” her two small children
looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes. they said nothing, but their
parted lips seemed to express the unconscious tragedy they felt.

walter morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time. he did not
think of the previous evening’s work. he scarcely thought of anything,
but he would not think of that. he lay and suffered like a sulking dog.
he had hurt himself most; and he was the more damaged because he would
never say a word to her, or express his sorrow. he tried to wriggle out
of it. “it was her own fault,” he said to himself. nothing, however,
could prevent his inner consciousness inflicting on him the punishment
which ate

cashier.

“an’ niver mind if he puts his foot through yer,” said a mocking voice
from behind.

all the men laughed. the large and important cashier looked down at his
next sheet.

“fred pilkington!” he called, quite indifferent.

mr. braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.

paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat. he was
pushed against the chimney-piece. his calves were burning. but he did
not hope to get through the wall of men.

“walter morel!” came the ringing voice.

“here!” piped paul, small and inadequate.

“morel--walter morel!” the cashier repeated, his finger and thumb on the
invoice, ready to pass on.

paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could not
or would not shout. the backs of the men obliterated him. then mr.
winterbottom came to the rescue.

“he’s here. where is he? morel’s lad?”

the fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes. he pointed at
the fireplace. the colliers

rt, his body limp and sick with some hurt or other. if it were he, she
would run out to help.

about a year after william went to london, and just after paul had left
school, before he got work, mrs. morel was upstairs and her son was
painting in the kitchen--he was very clever with his brush--when there
came a knock at the door. crossly he put down his brush to go. at the
same moment his mother opened a window upstairs and looked down.

a pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.

“is this walter morel’s?” he asked.

“yes,” said mrs. morel. “what is it?”

but she had guessed already.

“your mester’s got hurt,” he said.

“eh, dear me!” she exclaimed. “it’s a wonder if he hadn’t, lad. and
what’s he done this time?”

“i don’t know for sure, but it’s ‘is leg somewhere. they ta’ein’ ‘im ter

“good gracious me!” she exclaimed. “eh, dear, what a one he is! there’s
not five minutes of peace, i’ll be hanged if there is! his t

ie, paul, and arthur were at home; mr. morel was gone to work. the
three children said not a word. annie began to whimper with fear; paul
set off for his father.

it was a beautiful day. at brinsley pit the white steam melted slowly in
the sunshine of a soft blue sky; the wheels of the headstocks twinkled
high up; the screen, shuffling its coal into the trucks, made a busy
noise.

“i want my father; he’s got to go to london,” said the boy to the first
man he met on the bank.

“tha wants walter morel? go in theer an’ tell joe ward.”

paul went into the little top office.

“i want my father; he’s got to go to london.”

“thy feyther? is he down? what’s his name?”

“mr. morel.”

“what, walter? is owt amiss?”

“he’s got to go to london.”

the man went to the telephone and rang up the bottom office.

“walter morel’s wanted, number 42, hard. summat’s amiss; there’s his lad
here.”

then he turned round to paul.

“he’ll be up in a few minutes,” he said.

“to-morrow--sunday? yes! can you tell me about what time there is a
train in the afternoon?”

“there is a central gets in at four-fifteen.”

“and will there be any way of getting up to the house? shall i have to
walk?” the doctor smiled.

“there is the tram,” said paul; “the western park tram.”

the doctor made a note of it.

“thank you!” he said, and shook hands.

then paul went on home to see his father, who was left in the charge of
minnie. walter morel was getting very grey now. paul found him digging
in the garden. he had written him a letter. he shook hands with his
father.

“hello, son! tha has landed, then?” said the father.

“yes,” replied the son. “but i’m going back to-night.”

“are ter, beguy!” exclaimed the collier. “an’ has ter eaten owt?”

“no.”

“that’s just like thee,” said morel. “come thy ways in.”

the father was afraid of the mention of his wife. the two went indoors.
paul ate in silence;

immediately he was alone. all the time, as he went about, he cried
mechanically. his mind and hands were busy. he cried, he did not know
why. it was his blood weeping. he was just as much alone whether he was
with clara or with the men in the white horse. just himself and this
pressure inside him, that was all that existed. he read sometimes. he
had to keep his mind occupied. and clara was a way of occupying his
mind.

on the saturday walter morel went to sheffield. he was a forlorn figure,
looking rather as if nobody owned him. paul ran upstairs.

“my father’s come,” he said, kissing his mother.

“has he?” she answered wearily.

the old collier came rather frightened into the bedroom.

“how dun i find thee, lass?” he said, going forward and kissing her in a
hasty, timid fashion.

“well, i’m middlin’,” she replied.

“i see tha art,” he said. he stood looking down on her. then he wiped

e made a moaning noise, lifted her arms, and put them round his
neck, drawing him to her. he hid his face on her shoulder, holding her
clasped.

“take me back!” she whispered, ecstatic. “take me back, take me back!”
 and she put her fingers through his fine, thin dark hair, as if she were
only semi-conscious. he tightened his grasp on her.

“do you want me again?” he murmured, broken.



chapter xv

derelict

clara went with her husband to sheffield, and paul scarcely saw her
again. walter morel seemed to have let all the trouble go over him, and
there he was, crawling about on the mud of it, just the same. there was
scarcely any bond between father and son, save that each felt he must
not let the other go in any actual want. as there was no one to keep on
the home, and as they could neither of them bear the emptiness of the
house, paul took lodgings in nottingham, and morel went to live with a
friendly family in bestwood.

everything seemed to have gone smash for the young man. he cou
