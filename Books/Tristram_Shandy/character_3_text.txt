tremble to think what a foundation had been laid for
a thousand weaknesses both of body and mind, which no skill of the
physician or the philosopher could ever afterwards have set thoroughly
to rights.



chapter 1.iii.

to my uncle mr. toby shandy do i stand indebted for the preceding
anecdote, to whom my father, who was an excellent natural philosopher,
and much given to close reasoning upon the smallest matters, had oft,
and heavily complained of the injury; but once more particularly, as
my uncle toby well remember'd, upon his observing a most unaccountable
obliquity, (as he call'd it) in my manner of setting up my top, and
justifying the principles upon which i had done it,--the old gentleman
shook his head, and in a tone more expressive by half of sorrow than
reproach,--he said his heart all along foreboded, and he saw it verified
in this, and from a thousand other observations he had made upon me,
that i should neither think nor act like any other man's child:--but
alas! continued he, sha

th a slave,
he had made it a rule for many years of his life,--on the first
sunday-night of every month throughout the whole year,--as certain as
ever the sunday-night came,--to wind up a large house-clock, which we
had standing on the back-stairs head, with his own hands:--and being
somewhere between fifty and sixty years of age at the time i have been
speaking of,--he had likewise gradually brought some other little family
concernments to the same period, in order, as he would often say to my
uncle toby, to get them all out of the way at one time, and be no more
plagued and pestered with them the rest of the month.

it was attended but with one misfortune, which, in a great measure, fell
upon myself, and the effects of which i fear i shall carry with me to my
grave; namely, that from an unhappy association of ideas, which have
no connection in nature, it so fell out at length, that my poor mother
could never hear the said clock wound up,--but the thoughts of some
other things unavoidably poppe

rectory or parsonage of shandy aforesaid, and all and every the tenths,
tythes, glebe-lands.'--in three words,--'my mother was to lay in (if she
chose it) in london.'

but in order to put a stop to the practice of any unfair play on
the part of my mother, which a marriage-article of this nature too
manifestly opened a door to, and which indeed had never been thought of
at all, but for my uncle toby shandy;--a clause was added in security of
my father which was this:--'that in case my mother hereafter should, at
any time, put my father to the trouble and expence of a london journey,
upon false cries and tokens;--that for every such instance, she should
forfeit all the right and title which the covenant gave her to the next
turn;--but to no more,--and so on, toties quoties, in as effectual a
manner, as if such a covenant betwixt them had not been made.'--this, by
the way, was no more than w

ess of the body,--as well as weakness of the mind,--and
then he would do nothing but syllogize within himself for a stage or two
together, how far the cause of all these vexations might, or might not,
have arisen out of himself.

in short, he had so many little subjects of disquietude springing out of
this one affair, all fretting successively in his mind as they rose up
in it, that my mother, whatever was her journey up, had but an uneasy
journey of it down.--in a word, as she complained to my uncle toby, he
would have tired out the patience of any flesh alive.



chapter 1.xvii.

though my father travelled homewards, as i told you, in none of the
best of moods,--pshawing and pishing all the way down,--yet he had
the complaisance to keep the worst part of the story still to
himself;--which was the resolution he had taken of doing himself
the justice, which my uncle toby's clause in the marriage-settlement
empowered him; nor was it till the very night in which i was begot,
which was thirteen mon

ehind such a variety of characters,--'twas no fair match:--'twas seven
to one.--what could my mother do?--she had the advantage (otherwise
she had been certainly overpowered) of a small reinforcement of chagrin
personal at the bottom, which bore her up, and enabled her to dispute
the affair with my father with so equal an advantage,--that both sides
sung te deum. in a word, my mother was to have the old woman,--and the
operator was to have licence to drink a bottle of wine with my father
and my uncle toby shandy in the back parlour,--for which he was to be
paid five guineas.

i must beg leave, before i finish this chapter, to enter a caveat in the
breast of my fair reader;--and it is this,--not to take it absolutely
for granted, from an unguarded word or two which i have dropp'd in
it,--'that i am a married man.'--i own, the tender appellation of
my dear, dear jenny,--with some other strokes of conjugal knowledge,
interspersed here and there, might, naturally enough, have misled

d'une petite canulle, and sans faire aucune tort au pere.



chapter 1.xxi.

--i wonder what's all that noise, and running backwards and forwards
for, above stairs, quoth my father, addressing himself, after an hour
and a half's silence, to my uncle toby,--who, you must know, was sitting
on the opposite side of the fire, smoaking his social pipe all the time,
in mute contemplation of a new pair of black plush-breeches which he
had got on:--what can they be doing, brother?--quoth my father,--we can
scarce hear ourselves talk.

i think, replied my uncle toby, taking his pipe from his mouth, and
striking the head of it two or three times upon the nail of his left
thumb, as he began his sentence,--i think, says he:--but to enter
rightly into my unc

, in course, put an end to all kind of knowledge,--and
then--we shall have all to begin over again; or, in other words, be
exactly where we started.

--happy! thrice happy times! i only wish that the aera of my begetting,
as well as the mode and manner of it, had been a little alter'd,--or
that it could have been put off, with any convenience to my father or
mother, for some twenty or five-and-twenty years longer, when a man in
the literary world might have stood some chance.--

but i forget my uncle toby, whom all this while we have left knocking
the ashes out of his tobacco-pipe.

his humour was of that particular species, which does honour to our
atmosphere; and i should have made no scruple of ranking him amongst
one of the first-rate productions of it, had not there appeared too many
strong lines in it of a family-likeness, which shewed that he derived
the singularity of his temper more from blood, than either wind or
water, or any modifications or combinations of them whatever: and i
have,

 which my
father, according to his hypothesis of christian names, would often say,
she might thank her godfathers and godmothers.

it will seem strange,--and i would as soon think of dropping a riddle
in the reader's way, which is not my interest to do, as set him upon
guessing how it could come to pass, that an event of this kind, so many
years after it had happened, should be reserved for the interruption of
the peace and unity, which otherwise so cordially subsisted, between my
father and my uncle toby. one would have thought, that the whole force
of the misfortune should have spent and wasted itself in the family at
first,--as is generally the case.--but nothing ever wrought with our
family after the ordinary way. possibly at the very time this happened,
it might have something else to afflict it; and as afflictions are sent
down for our good, and that as this had never done the shandy family
any good at all, it might lie waiting till apt times and circumstances
should give it an opportunity

he assistance merely of the
inquisitive;--to them i write,--and by them i shall be read,--if any
such reading as this could be supposed to hold out so long,--to the very
end of the world.

why this cause of sorrow, therefore, was thus reserved for my father and
uncle, is undetermined by me. but how and in what direction it exerted
itself so as to become the cause of dissatisfaction between them, after
it began to operate, is what i am able to explain with great exactness,
and is as follows:

my uncle toby shandy, madam, was a gentleman, who, with the virtues
which usually constitute the character of a man of honour and
rectitude,--possessed one in a very eminent degree, which is seldom
or never put into the catalogue; and that was a most extreme and
unparallel'd modesty of nature;--though i correct the word nature, for
this reason, that i may not prejudge a point which must shortly come
to a hearing, and that is, whether this modesty of his was natural or
acquir'd.--whichever way my uncle toby c
 
 ___________________________
 
ame by it, 'twas nevertheless
modesty in the truest sense of it; and that is, madam, not in regard to
words, for he was so unhappy as to have very little choice in them,--but
to things;--and this kind of modesty so possessed him, and it arose to
such a height in him, as almost to equal, if such a thing could be,
even the modesty of a woman: that female nicety, madam, and inward
cleanliness of mind and fancy, in your sex, which makes you so much the
awe of ours.

you will imagine, madam, that my uncle toby had contracted all this
from this very source;--that he had spent a great part of his time in
converse with your sex, and that from a thorough knowledge of you, and
the force of imitation which such fair examples render irresistible, he
had acquired this amiable turn of mind.

i wish i could say so,--for unless it was with his sister-in-law, my
father's wife and my mother--my uncle toby scarce exchanged three words
with the sex in as many years;--no, he got it, madam, by a blow.--a
blow!--yes, 
 
 ___________________________
 
madam, it was owing to a blow from a stone, broke off by a
ball from the parapet of a horn-work at the siege of namur, which struck
full upon my uncle toby's groin.--which way could that effect it? the
story of that, madam, is long and interesting;--but it would be running
my history all upon heaps to give it you here.--'tis for an episode
hereafter; and every circumstance relating to it, in its proper place,
shall be faithfully laid before you:--'till then, it is not in my power
to give farther light into this matter, or say more than what i have
said already,--that my uncle toby was a gentleman of unparallel'd
modesty, which happening to be some

ed and rarified by the
constant heat of a little family pride,--they both so wrought together
within him, that he could never bear to hear the affair of my aunt dinah
touch'd upon, but with the greatest emotion.--the least hint of it was
enough to make the blood fly into his face;--but when my father enlarged
upon the story in mixed companies, which the illustration of his
hypothesis frequently obliged him to do,--the unfortunate blight of one
of the fairest branches of the family, would set my uncle toby's honour
and modesty o'bleeding; and he would often take my father aside, in the
greatest concern imaginable, to expostulate and tell him, he would give
him any thing in the world, only to let the story rest.

my father, i believe, had the truest love and tenderness for my uncle
toby, that ever one brother bore towards another, and would have done
any thing in nature, which one brother in reason could have desir'd of
another, to have made my uncle toby's heart easy in this, or any other
point. 
 
 ___________________________
 
 service in establishing my
father's system, which, i trust, will for ever hereafter be called the
shandean system, after his.

in any other family dishonour, my father, i believe, had as nice a
sense of shame as any man whatever;--and neither he, nor, i dare say,
copernicus, would have divulged the affair in either case, or have taken
the least notice of it to the world, but for the obligations they
owed, as they thought, to truth.--amicus plato, my father would say,
construing the words to my uncle toby, as he went along, amicus plato;
that is, dinah was my aunt;--sed magis amica veritas--but truth is my
sister.

this contrariety of humours betwixt my father and my uncle, was the
source of many a fraternal squabble. the one could not bear to hear the
tale of family disgrace recorded,--and the other would scarce ever let a
day pass to an end without some hint at it.

for god's sake, my uncle toby would cry,--and for my sake, and for all
our sakes, my dear brother shandy,--do let this story of o

ur aunt's
and her ashes sleep in peace;--how can you,--how can you have so little
feeling and compassion for the character of our family?--what is the
character of a family to an hypothesis? my father would reply.--nay,
if you come to that--what is the life of a family?--the life of a
family!--my uncle toby would say, throwing himself back in his arm
chair, and lifting up his hands, his eyes, and one leg--yes, the
life,--my father would say, maintaining his point. how many thousands
of 'em are there every year that come cast away, (in all civilized
countries at least)--and considered as nothing but common air, in
competition of an hypothesis. in my plain sense of things, my uncle toby
would answer,--every such instance is downright murder, let who will
commit it.--there lies your mistake, my fathe

r would reply;--for, in
foro scientiae there is no such thing as murder,--'tis only death,
brother.

my uncle toby would never offer to answer this by any other kind of
argument, than that of whistling half a dozen bars of lillebullero.--you
must know it was the usual channel thro' which his passions got vent,
when any thing shocked or surprized him:--but especially when any thing,
which he deem'd very absurd, was offered.

as not one of our logical writers, nor any of the commentators upon
them, that i remember, have thought proper to give a name to this
particular species of argument.--i here take the lib

-looked by my reader,--not for want of penetration in him,--but
because 'tis an excellence seldom looked for, or expected indeed, in a
digression;--and it is this: that tho' my digressions are all fair, as
you observe,--and that i fly off from what i am about, as far, and as
often too, as any writer in great britain; yet i constantly take care
to order affairs so that my main business does not stand still in my
absence.

i was just going, for example, to have given you the great out-lines of
my uncle toby's most whimsical character;--when my aunt dinah and the
coachman came across us, and led us a vagary some millions of miles into
the very heart of the planetary system: notwithstanding all this, you
perceive that the drawing of my uncle toby's character went on gently
all the time;--not the great contours of it,--that was impossible,--but
some familiar strokes and faint designations of it, were here and there
touch'd on, as we went along, so that you are much better acquainted
with my uncle tob
 
 ___________________________
 
 all, because, there you are sure to be
represented in some of your most ridiculous attitudes.

to avoid all and every one of these errors in giving you my uncle
toby's character, i am determined to draw it by no mechanical help
whatever;--nor shall my pencil be guided by any one wind-instrument
which ever was blown upon, either on this, or on the other side of the
alps;--nor will i consider either his repletions or his discharges,--or
touch upon his non-naturals; but, in a word, i will draw my uncle toby's
character from his hobby-horse.



chapter 1.xxiv.

if i was not morally sure that the reader must be out of all patience
for my uncle toby's character,--i would here previously have convinced
him that there is no instrument so fit to draw such a thing with, as
that which i have pitch'd upon.

a man and his hobby-horse, tho' i cannot say that they act and re-act
exactly after the same manner in which the soul and body do upon each
other: yet doubtless there is a communication between them of 
 
 ___________________________
 
 of the
manner of electrified bodies,--and that, by means of the heated parts
of the rider, which come immediately into contact with the back of the
hobby-horse,--by long journies and much friction, it so happens, that
the body of the rider is at length fill'd as full of hobby-horsical
matter as it can hold;--so that if you are able to give but a clear
description of the nature of the one, you may form a pretty exact notion
of the genius and character of the other.

now the hobby-horse which my uncle toby always rode upon, was in my
opinion an hobby-horse well worth giving a description of, if it was
only upon the score of his great singularity;--for you might have
travelled from york to dover,--from dover to penzance in cornwall, and
from penzance to york back again, and not have seen such another upon
the road; or if you had seen such a one, whatever haste you had been in,
you must infallibly have stopp'd to have taken a view of him. indeed,
the gait and figure of him was so strange, and so ut
 
 ___________________________
 
terly unlike was he,
from his head to his tail, to any one of the whole species, that it
was now and then made a matter of dispute,--whether he was really a
hobby-horse or no: but as the philosopher would use no other argument to
the sceptic, who disputed with him against the reality of motion, save
that of rising up upon his legs, and walking across the room;--so would
my uncle toby use no other argument to prove his hobby-horse was
a hobby-horse indeed, but by getting upon his back and riding him
about;--leaving the world, after that, to determine the point as it
thought fit.

in good truth, my uncle toby mounted him with so much pleasure, and he
carried my uncle toby so well,--that he troubled his head very little
with what the world either said or thought about it.

it is now high time, however, that i give you a description of him:--but
to go on regularly, i only beg y

ou will give me leave to acquaint you
first, how my uncle toby came by him.



chapter 1.xxv.

the wound in my uncle toby's groin, which he received at the siege of
namur, rendering him unfit for the service, it was thought expedient he
should return to england, in order, if possible, to be set to rights.

he was four years totally confined,--part of it to his bed, and all of
it to his room: and in the course of his cure, which was all that
time in hand, suffer'd unspeakable miseries,--owing to a succession of
exfoliations from the os pubis, and the outward edge of that part of the
coxendix called the os illium,--
 
 ___________________________
 
both which bones were dismally crush'd,
as much by the irregularity of the stone, which i told you was broke off
the parapet,--as by its size,--(tho' it was pretty large) which inclined
the surgeon all along to think, that the great injury which it had
done my uncle toby's groin, was more owing to the gravity of the stone
itself, than to the projectile force of it,--which he would often tell
him was a great happiness.

my father at that time was just beginning business in london, and had
taken a house;--and as the truest friendship and cordiality subsisted
between the two brothers,--and that my father thought my uncle toby
could no where be so well nursed and taken care of as in his own
house,--he assign'd him the very best apartment in it.--and what was a
much
 
 ___________________________
 
 occasion, but
he would take him by the hand, and lead him up stairs to see his brother
toby, and chat an hour by his bed-side.

the history of a soldier's wound beguiles the pain of it;--my uncle's
visitors at least thought so, and in their daily calls upon him, from
the courtesy arising out of that belief, they would frequently turn the
discourse to that subject,--and from that subject the discourse would
generally roll on to the siege itself.

these conversations were infinitely kind; and my uncle toby received
great relief from them, and would have received much more, but that they
brought him into some unforeseen perplexities, which, for three months
together, retarded his cure greatly; and if he had not hit upon an
expedient to extricate himself out of them, i verily believe they would
have laid him in his grave.

what these perplexities of my uncle toby were,--'tis impossible for you
to guess;--if you could,--i should blush; not as a relation,--not as a
man,--nor even as a woman,--but i s

 author; inasmuch
as i set no small store by myself upon this very account, that my reader
has never yet been able to guess at any thing. and in this, sir, i am
of so nice and singular a humour, that if i thought you was able to form
the least judgment or probable conjecture to yourself, of what was to
come in the next page,--i would tear it out of my book.



chapter 1.xxvi.

i have begun a new book, on purpose that i might have room enough
to explain the nature of the perplexities in which my uncle toby was
involved, from the many discourses and interrogations about the siege of
namur, where he received his wound.

i must remind the reader, in case he has read the history of king
william's wars,--but if he has not,--i then inform him, that one of the
most memorable attacks in that siege, was that which was made by the
english and dutch upon the point of the advanced counterscarp, between
the gate of st. nicolas, which inclosed the great sluice or water-stop,
where the english were terribly exp
 
 ___________________________
 
osed to the shot of the counter-guard
and demi-bastion of st. roch: the issue of which hot dispute, in
three words, was this; that the dutch lodged themselves upon the
counter-guard,--and that the english made themselves masters of the
covered-way before st. nicolas-gate, notwithstanding the gallantry of
the french officers, who exposed themselves upon the glacis sword in
hand.

as this was the principal attack of which my uncle toby was an
eye-witness at namur,--the army of the besiegers being cut off, by the
confluence of the maes and sambre, from seeing much of each other's
operations,--my uncle toby was generally more eloquent and particular in
his account of it; and the many perplexities he was in, arose out of
the almost insurmountable difficulties he found in telling his story
intelligibly, and giving such clear ideas of the differences and
distinctions between the scarp and counterscarp,--the glacis and
covered-way,
 
 ___________________________
 
--the half-moon and ravelin,--as to make his company fully
comprehend where and what he was about.

writers themselves are too apt to confound these terms; so that you will
the less wonder, if in his endeavours to explain them, and in opposition
to many misconceptions, that my uncle toby did oft-times puzzle his
visitors, and sometimes himself too.

to speak the truth, unless the company my father led up stairs were
tolerably clear-headed, or my uncle toby was in one of his explanatory
moods, 'twas a difficult thing, do what he could, to keep the discourse
free from obscurity.

what rendered the account of this affair the more intricate to my uncle
toby, was this,--that in the attack of the counterscarp, before the gate
of st. nicolas, extending itself from the bank of the maes, quite up
to the great water-stop,--the ground was cut and cross cut with such a
multitude of dykes, drains, rivulets, and sluices, on all sides,--and
he would get so sadl
 
 ___________________________
 
y bewildered, and set fast amongst them, that
frequently he could neither get backwards or forwards to save his life;
and was oft-times obliged to give up the attack upon that very account
only.

these perplexing rebuffs gave my uncle toby shandy more perturbations
than you would imagine; and as my father's kindness to him was
continually dragging up fresh friends and fresh enquirers,--he had but a
very uneasy task of it.

no doubt my uncle toby had great command of himself,--and could guard
appearances, i believe, as well as most men;--yet any one may imagine,
that when he could not retreat out of the ravelin without getting into
the half-moon, or get out of the covered-way without falling down the
counterscarp, nor cross the dyke without danger of slipping into
the ditch, but that he must have fretted and fumed inwardly:--he did
so;--and the little and hourly vexations, which may seem trifling and
of no account to the man who has not
 
 ___________________________
 
 read hippocrates, yet, whoever has
read hippocrates, or dr. james mackenzie, and has considered well the
effects which the passions and affections of the mind have upon the
digestion--(why not of a wound as well as of a dinner?)--may easily
conceive what sharp paroxysms and exacerbations of his wound my uncle
toby must have undergone upon that score only.

--my uncle toby could not philosophize upon it;--'twas enough he felt
it was so,--and having sustained the pain and sorrows of it for three
months together, he was resolved some way or other to extricate himself.

he was one morning lying upon his back in his bed, the anguish and
nature of the wound upon his groin suffering him to lie in no other
position, when a thought came into his head, that if he could purchase
such a thing, and have it pasted down upon a board, as a large map of
the fortification of the 
 
 ___________________________
 
town and citadel of namur, with its environs,
it might be a means of giving him ease.--i take notice of his desire
to have the environs along with the town and citadel, for this
reason,--because my uncle toby's wound was got in one of the traverses,
about thirty toises from the returning angle of the trench, opposite
to the salient angle of the demi-bastion of st. roch:--so that he was
pretty confident he could stick a pin upon the identical spot of ground
where he was standing on when the stone struck him.

all this succeeded to his wishes, and not only freed him from a world
of sad explanations, but, in the end, it proved the happy means, as you
will read, of procuring my uncle toby his hobby-hors

, but sit down without any
ceremony, and fall on heartily.

i said i had left six places, and i was upon the point of carrying my
complaisance so far, as to have left a seventh open for them,--and in
this very spot i stand on; but being told by a critick (tho' not by
occupation,--but by nature) that i had acquitted myself well enough,
i shall fill it up directly, hoping, in the mean time, that i shall be
able to make a great deal of more room next year.

--how, in the name of wonder! could your uncle toby, who, it seems, was
a military man, and whom you have represented as no fool,--be at the
same time such a confused, pudding-headed, muddle-headed, fellow, as--go
look.

so, sir critick, i could have replied; but i scorn it.--'tis language
unurbane,--and only befitting the man who cannot give clear and
satisfactory accounts of things, or dive deep enough into the first
causes of human ignorance and confusion. it is moreover the reply
valiant--and therefore i reject it; for tho' it might have sui

uncle toby's character as a soldier excellently well,--and had he not
accustomed himself, in such attacks, to whistle the lillabullero, as
he wanted no courage, 'tis the very answer he would have given; yet it
would by no means have done for me. you see as plain as can be, that i
write as a man of erudition;--that even my similies, my allusions, my
illustrations, my metaphors, are erudite,--and that i must sustain
my character properly, and contrast it properly too,--else what would

wax good, and eke the thimble, but applied thereto in careless haste, as
her mistress rings the bell;--in any one of these three cases the print
left by the thimble will be as unlike the prototype as a brass-jack.

now you must understand that not one of these was the true cause of the
confusion in my uncle toby's discourse; and it is for that very reason
i enlarge upon them so long, after the manner of great physiologists--to
shew the world, what it did not arise from.

what it did arise from, i have hinted above, and a fertile source of
obscurity it is,--and ever will be,--and that is the unsteady uses
of words, which have perplexed the clearest and most exalted
understandings.

it is ten to one (at arthur's) whether you have ever read the literary
histories of past ages;--if you have, what terrible

been pestered and disordered, at one time or other, by this, and this
only:--what a pudder and racket in councils about (greek); and in the
schools of the learned about power and about spirit;--about essences,
and about quintessences;--about substances, and about space.--what
confusion in greater theatres from words of little meaning, and as
indeterminate a sense! when thou considerest this, thou wilt not wonder
at my uncle toby's perplexities,--thou wilt drop a tear of pity upon
his scarp and his counterscarp;--his glacis and his covered way;--his
ravelin and his half-moon: 'twas not by ideas,--by heaven; his life was
put in jeopardy by words.



chapter 1.xxviii.

when my uncle toby got his map of namur to his mind, he began
immediately to apply himself, and with the utmost diligence, to the
study of it; for nothing being of more importance to him than his
recovery, and his recovery depending, as you have read, upon 
 
 ___________________________
 
the
passions and affections of his mind, it behoved him to take the nicest
care to make himself so far master of his subject, as to be able to talk
upon it without emotion.

in a fortnight's close and painful application, which, by the bye, did
my uncle toby's wound, upon his groin, no good,--he was enabled, by the
help of some marginal documents at the feet of the elephant, together
with gobesius's military architecture and pyroballogy, translated from
the flemish, to form his discourse with passable perspicuity; and before
he was two full months gone,--he was right eloquent upon it, and
could make not only the attack of the advanced counterscarp with great
order;--but having, by that time, gone much deeper into the art, than
what his first motive
 
 ___________________________
 
 made necessary, my uncle toby was able to cross
the maes and sambre; make diversions as far as vauban's line, the abbey
of salsines, &c. and give his visitors as distinct a history of each of
their attacks, as of that of the gate of st. nicolas, where he had the
honour to receive his wound.

but desire of knowledge, like the thirst of riches, increases ever with
the acquisition of it. the more my uncle toby pored over his map,
the more he took a liking to it!--by the same process and electrical
assimilation, as i told you, through which i ween the souls of
connoisseurs themselves, by long friction and incumbition, have the
happiness, at length, to get all be-virtu'd--be-pictured,--be-
butterflied, and be-fiddled.

the more my uncle toby drank of this sweet fountain of science, the
greater was the heat and impatience of his thirst, so that before the
first year of his confinement had well gone roun

d, there was scarce a
fortified town in italy or flanders, of which, by one means or other,
he had not procured a plan, reading over as he got them, and carefully
collating therewith the histories of their sieges, their demolitions,
their improvements, and new works, all which he would read with that
intense application and delight, that he would forget himself, his
wound, his confinement, his dinner.

in the second year my uncle toby purchased ramelli and cataneo,
translated from the italian;--likewise stevinus, moralis, the chevalier
de ville, lorini, cochorn, sheeter, the count de pagan, the marshal
vauban, mons. blondel, with almost as many more books of military
architecture, as don quixote was found to have of chivalry, when the
curate and barber invaded his library.

towards the beginning of the third year, which was in august,
ninety-nine, my uncle toby found it necessary to understand a little of
projectiles:--and h
 
 ___________________________
 
aving judged it best to draw his knowledge from the
fountain-head, he began with n. tartaglia, who it seems was the first
man who detected the imposition of a cannon-ball's doing all that
mischief under the notion of a right line--this n. tartaglia proved to
my uncle toby to be an impossible thing.

--endless is the search of truth.

no sooner was my uncle toby satisfied which road the cannon-ball did not
go, but he was insensibly led on, and resolved in his mind to enquire
and find out which road the ball did go: for which purpose he was
obliged to set off afresh with old maltus, and studied him devoutly.--he
proceeded next to galileo and torricellius, wherein, by certain
geometrical rules, infallibly laid down, he found the precise path to
be a parabola--or else an hyperbola,--and that the parameter, or latus
rectum, of the conic section of the said
 
 ___________________________
 
 path, was to the quantity and
amplitude in a direct ratio, as the whole line to the sine of double the
angle of incidence, formed by the breech upon an horizontal plane;--and
that the semiparameter,--stop! my dear uncle toby--stop!--go not one
foot farther into this thorny and bewildered track,--intricate are the
steps! intricate are the mazes of this labyrinth! intricate are the
troubles which the pursuit of this bewitching phantom knowledge
will bring upon thee.--o my uncle;--fly--fly,--fly from it as from a
serpent.--is it fit--goodnatured man! thou should'st sit up, with
the wound upon thy groin, whole nights baking thy blood with
hectic watchings?--alas! 'twill exasperate thy symptoms,--check thy

i would not give a groat for that man's knowledge in pen-craft, who does
not understand this,--that the best plain narrative in the world, tacked
very close to the last spirited apostrophe to my uncle toby--would
have felt both cold and vapid upon the reader's palate;--therefore i
forthwith put an end to the chapter, though i was in the middle of my
story.

--writers of my stamp have one principle in common with painters. where
an exact copying makes our pictures less striking, we choose the less

beauty. this is to be understood cum grano salis; but be it as it
will,--as the parallel is made more for the sake of letting the

strophe cool, than any thing else,--'tis not very material whether
upon any other score the reader approves of it or not.

in the latter end of the third year, my uncle toby perceiving that the
parameter and semi-parameter of the conic section angered his wound,
he left off the study of projectiles in a kind of a huff, and betook
himself to the practical part of fortification only; the pleasure of
which, like a spring held back, returned upon him with redoubled force.

it was in this year that my uncle began to break in upon the daily
regularity of a clean shirt,--to dismiss his barber unshaven,--and to
allow his surgeon scarce time sufficient to dress his wound, c
 
 ___________________________
 
, in order to
expostulate with him upon the protraction of the cure, which, he told
him, might surely have been accomplished at least by that time:--he
dwelt long upon the miseries he had undergone, and the sorrows of his
four years melancholy imprisonment;--adding, that had it not been for
the kind looks and fraternal chearings of the best of brothers,--he
had long since sunk under his misfortunes.--my father was by. my uncle
toby's eloquence brought tears into his eyes;--'twas unexpected:--my
uncle toby, by nature was not eloquent;--it had the greater effect:--the
surgeon was confounded;--not that there wanted grounds for such, or
greater marks of impatience,--but 'twas unexpected too; in the four
years he had attended him, he had never seen any thing like it in
my uncle toby's carriage; he had never once dropped one fretful or
discontented word;--he had been all patience,--all submission.

--we lose the right of complaining sometimes by forbearing it;--but we
often treble the force:--the surg
 
 ___________________________
 
eon was astonished; but much more so,
when he heard my uncle toby go on, and peremptorily insist upon his
healing up the wound directly,--or sending for monsieur ronjat, the
king's serjeant-surgeon, to do it for him.

the desire of life and health is implanted in man's nature;--the love of
liberty and enlargement is a sister-passion to it: these my uncle toby
had in common with his species--and either of them had been sufficient
to account for his earnest desire to get well and out of doors;--but
i have told you before, that nothing wrought with our family after the
common way;--and from the time and manner in which this eager desire
shewed itself in the present case, the penetrating reader will suspect
there was some other cause or crotchet for it in my uncle toby's
head:--there was so, and 'tis the subject of the next chapter to set
forth what tha

t cause and crotchet was. i own, when that's done, 'twill
be time to return back to the parlour fire-side, where we left my uncle
toby in the middle of his sentence.



chapter 1.xxx.

when a man gives himself up to the government of a ruling passion,--or,
in other words, when his hobby-horse grows headstrong,--farewell cool
reason and fair discretion!

my uncle toby's wound was near well, and as soon as the surgeon
recovered his surprize, and could get leave to say as much--he told
him, 'twas just beginning to incarnate; and that if no fresh exfoliation
happened, which there was no sign of,--it would be dried up in five or
six weeks. the sound of as many olympiads, twelve hours before, would
have conveyed an idea of shorter duration to my uncle toby's mind.--the
succession of his ideas was now rapid,--he broiled with impatience to
put his design in executi

ed to take no one soul's advice,--he privately ordered
trim, his man, to pack up a bundle of lint and dressings, and hire a
chariot-and-four to be at the door exactly by twelve o'clock that day,
when he knew my father would be upon 'change.--so leaving a bank-note
upon the table for the surgeon's care of him, and a letter of
tender thanks for his brother's--he packed up his maps, his books of
fortification, his instruments, &c. and by the help of a crutch on one
side, and trim on the other,--my uncle toby embarked for shandy-hall.

the reason, or rather the rise of this sudden demigration was as
follows:

the table in my uncle toby's room, and at which, the night before this
change happened, he was sitting with his maps, &c. about him--being
somewhat of the smallest, for that infinity of great and small
instruments of knowledge which usually lay crowded upon it--he had
the accident, in reaching over for his tobacco-box, to throw down his
compasses, and in stooping to take the compasses up, with 
 
 ___________________________
 
his sleeve he
threw down his case of instruments and snuffers;--and as the dice took
a run against him, in his endeavouring to catch the snuffers in
falling,--he thrust monsieur blondel off the table, and count de pagon
o'top of him.

'twas to no purpose for a man, lame as my uncle toby was, to think
of redressing these evils by himself,--he rung his bell for his man
trim;--trim, quoth my uncle toby, prithee see what confusion i have here
been making--i must have some better contrivance, trim.--can'st not thou
take my rule, and measure the length and breadth of this table, and
then go and bespeak me one as big again?--yes, an' please your honour,
replied trim, making a bow; but i hope your honour will be soon well
enough to get down to your country-seat, where,--as your honour takes so
much pleasure in fortification, we could manage this matter to a t.

i must here inform you, that this se
 
 ___________________________
 
rvant of my uncle toby's, who went
by the name of trim, had been a corporal in my uncle's own company,--his
real name was james butler,--but having got the nick-name of trim, in
the regiment, my uncle toby, unless when he happened to be very angry
with him, would never call him by any other name.

the poor fellow had been disabled for the service, by a wound on his
left knee by a musket-bullet, at the battle of landen, which was two
years before the affair of namur;--and as the fellow was well-beloved
in the regiment, and a handy fellow into the bargain, my uncle toby took
him for his servant; and of an excellent use was he, attending my uncle
toby in the camp and in his quarters as a valet, groo

m, barber, cook,
sempster, and nurse; and indeed, from first to last, waited upon him and
served him with great fidelity and affection.

my uncle toby loved the man in return, and what attached him more to him
still, was the similitude of their knowledge.--for corporal trim, (for
so, for the future, i shall call him) by four years occasional attention
to his master's discourse upon fortified towns, and the advantage of
prying and peeping continually into his master's plans, &c. exclusive
and besides what he gained hobby-horsically, as a body-servant, non
hobby horsical per se;--had become no mean proficient in the science;
and was thought, by

 the cook and chamber-maid, to know as much of the
nature of strong-holds as my uncle toby himself.

i have but one more stroke to give to finish corporal trim's
character,--and it is the only dark line in it.--the fellow loved to
advise,--or rather to hear himself talk; his carriage, however, was so
perfectly respectful, 'twas easy to keep him silent when you had him
so; but set his tongue a-going,--you had no hold of him--he was
voluble;--the eternal interlardings of your honour, with the
respectfulness of corporal trim's manner, interceding so strong
in behalf of his elocution,--t

hat though you might have been
incommoded,--you could not well be angry. my uncle toby was seldom
either the one or the other with him,--or, at least, this fault, in
trim, broke no squares with them. my uncle toby, as i said, loved the
man;--and besides, as he ever looked upon a faithful servant,--but as an
humble friend,--he could not bear to stop his mouth.--such was corporal
trim.

if i durst presume, continued trim, to give your honour my advice, and
speak my opinion in this matter.--thou art welcome, trim, quoth my uncle
toby--speak,--speak what thou thinkest upon the subject, man, without
fear.--why then, replied trim, (not hanging his ears and scratching his
head like a country-lout, but) stroking
 
 ___________________________
 
 replied my uncle.--i would throw out the earth upon
this hand towards the town for the scarp,--and on that hand towards
the campaign for the counterscarp.--very right, trim, quoth my uncle
toby:--and when i had sloped them to your mind,--an' please your honour,
i would face the glacis, as the finest fortifications are done in
flanders, with sods,--and as your honour knows they should be,--and i
would make the walls and parapets with sods too.--the best engineers
call them gazons, trim, said my uncle toby.--whether they are gazons or
sods, is not much matter, replied trim; your honour knows they are ten
times beyond a facing either of brick or stone.--i know they are,
trim in some respects,--quoth my uncle toby, nodding his head;--for a
cannon-ball enters into the gazon right onwards, without bringing any
rubbish down with it, which might fill the fosse, (as was the case at
st. nicolas's gate) and facilitate the passage over it.

your honour understands these matters, replied corporal trim, bett

than any officer in his majesty's service;--but would your honour please
to let the bespeaking of the table alone, and let us but go into the
country, i would work under your honour's directions like a horse,
and make fortifications for you something like a tansy, with all their
batteries, saps, ditches, and palisadoes, that it should be worth all
the world's riding twenty miles to go and see it.

my uncle toby blushed as red as scarlet as trim went on;--but it was not
a blush of guilt,--of modesty,--or of anger,--it was a blush of joy;--he
was fired with corporal trim's project and description.--trim! said
my uncle toby, thou hast said enough.--we might begin the campaign,
continued trim, on the very day that his majesty and the allies take the
field, and demolish them town by town as fast as--trim, quoth my uncle
toby, say no more. your honour, continued trim, might sit in your
arm-chair (pointing t

i would--say no more, trim, quoth my uncle toby--besides, your honour
would get not only pleasure and good pastime--but good air, and good
exercise, and good health,--and your honour's wound would be well in a
month. thou hast said enough, trim,--quoth my uncle toby (putting his
hand into his breeches-pocket)--i like thy project mightily.--and if
your honour pleases, i'll this moment go and buy a pioneer's spade
to take down with us, and i'll bespeak a shovel and a pick-axe, and a
couple of--say no more, trim, quoth my uncle toby, leaping up upon one
leg, quite overcome with rapture,--and thrusting a guinea into trim's
hand,--trim, said my uncle toby, say no more;--but go down, trim, this
moment, my lad, and bring up my supper this instant.

trim ran down 
 
 ___________________________
 
and brought up his master's supper,--to no
purpose:--trim's plan of operation ran so in my uncle toby's head, he
could not taste it.--trim, quoth my uncle toby, get me to bed.--'twas
all one.--corporal trim's description had fired his imagination,--my
uncle toby could not shut his eyes.--the more he considered it, the more
bewitching the scene appeared to him;--so that, two full hours before
day-light, he had come to a final determination and had concerted the
whole plan of his and corporal trim's decampment.

my uncle toby had a little neat country-house of his own, in the village
where my father's estate lay at shandy, which had been left him by
an old uncle, with a small estate of about one hundred pounds a-year.
behind this house, and contiguous to
 
 ___________________________
 
 it, was a kitchen-garden of about
half an acre, and at the bottom of the garden, and cut off from it by
a tall yew hedge, was a bowling-green, containing just about as much
ground as corporal trim wished for;--so that as trim uttered the
words, 'a rood and a half of ground to do what they would with,'--this
identical bowling-green instantly presented itself, and became curiously
painted all at once, upon the retina of my uncle toby's fancy;--which
was the physical cause of making him change colour, or at least of
heightening his blush, to that immoderate degree i spoke of.

never did lover post down to a beloved mistress with more heat and
expectation, than my uncle toby did, to enjoy this self-same thing in
private;--i say in private;--for it was sheltered from the house, as i
told you, by a tall yew hedge, and was covered on the other three sides,
from mortal sight, by rough holly and thick-set flowering shrubs:--so
tha
 
 ___________________________
 
t the idea of not being seen, did not a little contribute to the
idea of pleasure pre-conceived in my uncle toby's mind.--vain thought!
however thick it was planted about,--or private soever it might
seem,--to think, dear uncle toby, of enjoying a thing which took up a
whole rood and a half of ground,--and not have it known!

how my uncle toby and corporal trim managed this matter,--with the
history of their campaigns, which were no way barren of events,--may
make no uninteresting under-plot in the epitasis and working-up of this
drama.--at present the scene must drop,--and change for the parlour
fire-side.



chapter 1.xxxi.

--what can they be doing? brother, said my father.--i think, replied
my uncle toby,--taking, as i told you, his pipe from his mouth, and
striking the ashes out of it as he began his sentence;--i think, replied

 
 ___________________________
 
s is taken very badly.--and where's susannah running down the
garden there, as if they were going to ravish her?--sir, she is running
the shortest cut into the town, replied obadiah, to fetch the old
midwife.--then saddle a horse, quoth my father, and do you go directly
for dr. slop, the man-midwife, with all our services,--and let him know
your mistress is fallen into labour--and that i desire he will return
with you with all speed.

it is very strange, says my father, addressing himself to my uncle toby,
as obadiah shut the door,--as there is so expert an operator as dr. slop
so near,--that my wife should persist to the very last in this obstinate
humour of hers, in trusting the life of my child, who has had one
misfortune already, to the ignorance of an old woman;--and not only the
life of my child, brother,--but her own life, and with it the lives of
all the children i might, peradventure, have begot out of her hereafter.

mayhap, brother, replied my uncle toby, my sister does it to save the

expence:--a pudding's end,--replied my father,--the doctor must be paid
the same for inaction as action,--if not better,--to keep him in temper.

--then it can be out of nothing in the whole world, quoth my uncle toby,
in the simplicity of his heart,--but modesty.--my sister, i dare say,
added he, does not care to let a man come so near her.... i will not say
whether my uncle toby had completed the sentence or not;--'tis for his
advantage to suppose he had,--as, i think, he could have added no one
word which would have improved it.

if, on the contrary, my uncle toby had not fully arrived at the period's
end--then the world stands indebted to the sudden snapping of my
father's tobacco-pipe for one of the neatest examples of that ornamental
figure in oratory, which rhetoricians stile the aposiopesis.--just
heaven! how does the poco piu and the poco meno of the italian
art

ists;--the insensible more or less, determine the precise line of
beauty in the sentence, as well as in the statue! how do the slight
touches of the chisel, the pencil, the pen, the fiddle-stick, et
caetera,--give the true swell, which gives the true pleasure!--o my
countrymen:--be nice; be cautious of your language; and never, o! never
let it be forgotten upon what small particles your eloquence and your
fame depend.

--'my sister, mayhap,' quoth my uncle toby, 'does not choose to let a
man come so near her....' make this dash,--'tis an aposiopesis,--take
the dash away, and write backside,--'tis bawdy.--scratch backside
out, and put cover'd way in, 'tis a metaphor;--and, i dare say, as
fortification ran so much in my uncle toby's head, that if he had been
left to have added one word to the sentence,--that word was it.

but whether that was the case or not the case;--or whether the snapping
of my father's tobacco-pipe, so critically, happened through

 natural philosopher,--yet he was something of
a moral philosopher too; for which reason, when his tobacco-pipe snapp'd
short in the middle,--he had nothing to do, as such, but to have taken
hold of the two pieces, and thrown them gently upon the back of the
fire.--he did no such thing;--he threw them with all the violence in the
world;--and, to give the action still more emphasis,--he started upon
both his legs to do it.

this looked something like heat;--and the manner of his reply to what my
uncle toby was saying, proved it was so.

--'not choose,' quoth my father, (repeating my uncle toby's words) 'to
let a man come so near her!'--by heaven, brother toby! you would try the
patience of job;--and i think i have the plagues of one already without
it.--why?--where?--wherein?--wherefore?--upon what account? replied my
uncle toby: in the utmost astonishment.--to think, said my father, of a
man living to your age, brother, and knowing so little about women!--i
know nothing at all about them,--repli

ed my uncle toby: and i think,
continued he, that the shock i received the year after the demolition of
dunkirk, in my affair with widow wadman;--which shock you know i should
not have received, but from my total ignorance of the sex,--has given me
just cause to say, that i neither know nor do pretend to know any thing
about 'em or their concerns either.--methinks, brother, replied my
father, you might, at least, know so much as the right end of a woman
from the wrong.

it is said in aristotle's master piece, '

that when a man doth think of
any thing which is past,--he looketh down upon the ground;--but that
when he thinketh of something that is to come, he looketh up towards the
heavens.'

my uncle toby, i suppose, thought of neither, for he look'd
horizontally.--right end! quoth my uncle toby, muttering the two words
low to himself, and fixing his two eyes insensibly as he muttered them,
upon a small crevice, formed by a bad joint in the chimney-piece--right
end of a woman!--i declare, quoth my uncle, i know no more which it is
than the man in the moon;--and if i was to think, continued my uncle
toby (keeping his eyes still fixed upon the bad joint) this month
together, i am sure i should not be able to find it out.

then, brother toby, replied my father, i will tell you.

every thi

ng in this world, continued my father (filling a fresh
pipe)--every thing in this world, my dear brother toby, has two
handles.--not always, quoth my uncle toby.--at least, replied my father,
every one has two hands,--which comes to the same thing.--now, if a man
was to sit down coolly, and consider within himself the make, the shape,
the construction, come-at-ability, and convenience of all the parts
which constitute the whole of that animal, called woman, and compare
them analogically--i never understood rightly the meaning of that
word,--quoth my uncle toby.--

analogy, replied my father, is the certain relation and agreement

simple modes, is got merely from the train and succession of our
ideas--and is the true scholastic pendulum,--and by which, as a scholar,
i will be tried in this matter,--abjuring and detesting the jurisdiction
of all other pendulums whatever.

i would therefore desire him to consider that it is but poor eight miles
from shandy-hall to dr. slop, the man-midwife's house:--and that whilst
obadiah has been going those said miles and back, i have brought my
uncle toby from namur, quite across all flanders, into england:--that
i have had him ill upon my hands near four years;--and have since
travelled him and corporal trim in a chariot-and-four, a journey of near
two hundred miles down into yorkshire.--all which put together, must
have prepared the reader's imagination for the entrance of dr. slop upon
the stage,--as much, at least (i hope) as a dance, a song, or a concerto
between the acts.

and speechless, for a full minute and a half at the parlour-door

parts, upon which he had received his fall, totally besmeared,--and in
every other part of him, blotched over in such a manner with obadiah's
explosion, that you would have sworn (without mental reservation) that
every grain of it had taken effect.

here was a fair opportunity for my uncle toby to have triumphed over
my father in his turn;--for no mortal, who had beheld dr. slop in that
pickle, could have dissented from so much, at least, of my uncle toby's
opinion, 'that mayhap his sister might not care to let such a dr. slop
come so near her....' but it was the argumentum ad hominem; and if my
uncle toby was not very expert at it, you may think, he might not care
to use it.--no; the reason was,--'twas not his nature to insult.

dr. slop's presence at that time, was no less problemat

the ringing of the bell and the rap upon the door,--measuring their
distance, and keeping his mind so intent upon the operation, as to have
power to think of nothing else,--common-place infirmity of the greatest
mathematicians! working with might and main at the demonstration, and so
wasting all their strength upon it, that they have none left in them to
draw the corollary, to do good with.

the ringing of the bell, and the rap upon the door, struck likewise
strong upon the sensorium of my uncle toby,--but it excited a very
different train of thoughts;--the two irreconcileable pulsations
instantly brought stevinus, the great engineer, along with them, into
my uncle toby's mind. what business stevinus had in this affair,--is
the greatest problem of all:--it shall be solved,--but not in the next
chapter.

your sudden and unexpected arrival, quoth my uncle toby, addressing
himself to dr. slop, (all three of them sitting down to the fire
together, as my uncle toby began to speak)--instantly brought the great
stevinus into my head, who, you must know, is a favourite author with
me.--then, added my father, making use of the argument ad crumenam,--i
will lay twenty guineas to a single crown-piece (which will serve to
give away to obadiah when he gets back

engineer or other--or has wrote something or other, either directly or
indirectly, upon the science of fortification.

he has so,--replied my uncle toby.--i knew it, said my father, though,
for the soul of me, i cannot see what kind of connection there can
be betwixt dr. slop's sudden coming, and a discourse upon
fortification;--yet i fear'd it.--talk of what we will, brother,--or let
the occasion be never so foreign or unfit for the subject,--you are
sure to bring it in. i would not, brother toby, continued my
father,--i declare i would not have my head so full of curtins and
horn-works.--that i dare say you would not, quoth dr. slop, interrup

dennis the critic could not detest and abhor a pun, or the insinuation
of a pun, more cordially than my father;--he would grow testy upon it at
any time;--but to be broke in upon by one, in a serious discourse, was
as bad, he would say, as a fillip upon the nose;--he saw no difference.

probability, have taken their name from them;'--nor have the horn-works
he speaks of, any thing in the world to do with the horn-works of
cuckoldom: but the curtin, sir, is the word we use in fortification, for
that part of the wall or rampart which lies between the two bastions and
joins them--besiegers seldom offer to carry

against the curtin, for this reason, because they are so well flanked.
('tis the case of other curtains, quoth dr. slop, laughing.) however,
continued my uncle toby, to make them sure, we generally choose to place
ravelins before them, taking care only to extend them beyond the fosse
or ditch:--the common men, who know very little of fortification,
confound the ravelin and the half-moon together,--tho' they are very
different things;--not in their figure or construction, for we make
them exactly alike, in all points; for they always consist of two faces,
making a salient angle, with the gorges, not straight, but in form of
a crescent;--where then lies the

difference? (quoth my father, a little
testily.)--in their situations, answered my uncle toby:--for when a
ravelin, brother, stands before the curtin, it is a ravelin; and when a
ravelin stands before a bastion, then the ravelin is not a ravelin;--it
is a half-moon;--a half-moon likewise is a half-moon, and no more, so
long as it stands before its bastion;--but was it to change place, and
get before the curtin,--'twould be no longer a half-moon; a half-moon,
in that case, is not a half-moon;--'tis no more than a ravelin.--i
think, quoth my father, that the noble science of defence has i

sides--as well as others.

as for the horn-work (high! ho! sigh'd my father) which, continued my
uncle toby, my brother was speaking of, they are a very considerable
part of an outwork;--they are called by the french engineers, ouvrage a
corne, and we generally make them to cover such places as we suspect
to be weaker than the rest;--'tis formed by two epaulments or
demi-bastions--they are very pretty,--and if you will take a walk, i'll
engage to shew you one well worth your trouble.--i own, continued my
uncle toby, when we crown them,--they are much stronger, but then they
are very expensive, and ta

e.--accoucheur,--if you please, quoth dr.
slop.--with all my heart, replied my father, i don't care what they
call you,--but i wish the whole science of fortification, with all its
inventors, at the devil;--it has been the death of thousands,--and it
will be mine in the end.--i would not, i would not, brother toby,
have my brains so full of saps, mines, blinds, gabions, pallisadoes,
ravelins, half-moons, and such trumpery, to be proprietor of namur, and
of all the towns in flanders with it.

my uncle toby was a man patient of injuries;--not from want of
courage,--i have told you in a former chapter, 'that he was a man of
courage:'--and will add here, that where just occasions presented, or
called it forth,--i know no man under whose arm i would have sooner
taken shelter;--nor did this arise from any insensibility or obtuseness
of his intellectual parts;--for he felt this insult of my father's
as feelingly as a man could do;--but he was of a peaceful, placid
nature,--no jarring element in it,--al

l was mixed up so kindly within
him; my uncle toby had scarce a heart to retaliate upon a fly.

--go--says he, one day at dinner, to an over-grown one which had buzzed
about his nose, and tormented him cruelly all dinner-time,--and which
after infinite attempts, he had caught at last, as it flew by him;--i'll
not hurt thee, says my uncle toby, rising from his chair, and going
across the room, with the fly in his hand,--i'll not hurt a hair of
thy head:--go, says he, lifting up the sash, and opening his hand as he
spoke, to let it escape;--go, poor devil, get thee gone, why should i
hurt thee?--this world surely is wide enough to hold both thee and me.

i was but ten years old when this happened: but whether it was, that the
action itself was more in unison to my nerves at that age of pity, which
instantly set my whole frame into one

sensation;--or how far the manner and expression of it might go towards
it;--or in what degree, or by what secret magick,--a tone of voice and
harmony of movement, attuned by mercy, might find a passage to my heart,
i know not;--this i know, that the lesson of universal good-will then
taught and imprinted by my uncle toby, has never since been worn out of
my mind: and tho' i would not depreciate what the study of the literae
humaniores, at the university, have done for me in that respect, or
discredit the other helps of an expensive education bestowed upon me,
both at home and abroad since;--yet i often think that i owe one half of
my philanthropy to that one accidental impression.

this is to serve for parents and governors instead of a whole volume
upon the subject.

the instrument with which i drew the other parts of it,--that taking in
no more than the mere hobby-horsical likeness:--this is a part of his
moral character. my father, in this patient endurance of wrongs, which i
mention, was very different, as the reader must long ago have noted; he
had a much more acute and quick sensibility of nature, attended with a
little soreness of temper; tho' this never transported him to any thing
which looked like malignancy:--yet in the little rubs a

of life, 'twas apt to shew itself in a drollish and witty kind of
peevishness:--he was, however, frank and generous in his nature;--at all
times open to conviction; and in the little ebullitions of this subacid
humour towards others, but particularly towards my uncle toby, whom he
truly loved:--he would feel more pain, ten times told (except in the
affair of my aunt dinah, or where an hypothesis was concerned) than what
he ever gave.

the characters of the two brothers, in this view of them, reflected
light upon each other, and appeared with great advantage in this affair
which arose about stevinus.

i need not tell the reader, if he keeps a hobby-horse,--that a man's
hobby-horse is as tender a part as he has about him; and that

him.--no:--as i said above, my uncle toby did feel them, and very
sensibly too.

pray, sir, what said he?--how did he behave?--o, sir!--it was great: for
as soon as my father had done insulting his hobby-horse,--he turned his
head without the least emotion, from dr. slop, to whom he was addressing
his discourse, and looking up into my father's face, with a countenance
spread over with so much good-nature;--so placid;--so fraternal;--so
inexpressibly tender towards him:--it penetrated my father to his heart:
he rose up hastily from his

chair, and seizing hold of both my
uncle toby's hands as he spoke:--brother toby, said he:--i beg thy
pardon;--forgive, i pray thee, this rash humour which my mother gave
me.--my dear, dear brother, answered my uncle toby, rising up by my
father's help, say no more about it;--you are heartily welcome, had it
been ten times as much, brother. but 'tis ungenerous, replied my father,
to hurt any man;--a brother worse;--but to hurt a brother of such gentle
manners,--so unprovoking,--and so unresenting;--'tis base:--by heaven,
'tis cowardly.--you are heartily welcome, brother, quoth my uncle
toby,--had it been fifty times as much.--besides, what have i to do,
my dear toby, cried my father, either with your amusements 
 
 ___________________________
 
or your
pleasures, unless it was in my power (which it is not) to increase their
measure?

--brother shandy, answered my uncle toby, looking wistfully in his
face,--you are much mistaken in this point:--for you do increase my
pleasure very much, in begetting children for the shandy family at your
time of life.--but, by that, sir, quoth dr. slop, mr. shandy increases
his own.--not a jot, quoth my father.



chapter 1.xxxviii.

my brother does it, quoth my uncle toby, out of principle.--in a family
way, i suppose, quoth dr. slop.--pshaw!--said my father,--'tis not worth
talking of.



chapter 1.xxxix.

at the end of the last chapter, my father and my uncle toby were left
both standing, like brutus and cassius, at the close of the scene,
making up their accounts.

as my father spoke the three last words,--he sat down;--my uncle toby
exactly followed his example, only, that before he took his chair, he
rung the bell, to order corporal trim, who was in waiting

, to step
home for stevinus:--my uncle toby's house being no farther off than the
opposite side of the way.

some men would have dropped the subject of stevinus;--but my uncle toby
had no resentment in his heart, and he went on with the subject, to shew
my father that he had none.

your sudden appearance, dr. slop, quoth my uncle, resuming the
discourse, instantly brought stevinus into my head. (my father, you
may be sure, did not offer to lay any more wagers upon stevinus's
head.)--because, continued my uncle toby, the celebrated sailing
chariot, which belonged to prince maurice, and was of such wonderful
contrivance and velocity, as to carry half a dozen people thirty g

erman
miles, in i don't know how few minutes,--was invented by stevinus, that
great mathematician and engineer.

you might have spared your servant the trouble, quoth dr. slop (as the
fellow is lame) of going for stevinus's account of it, because in my
return from leyden thro' the hague, i walked as far as schevling, which
is two long miles, on purpose to take a view of it.

that's nothing, replied my uncle toby, to what the learned peireskius
did, who walked a matter of five hundred miles, reckoning from paris to
schevling, and from schevling to paris back again, in order to see it,
and nothing else.

some men cannot bear to be out-gone.

the more fool peireskius, replied dr. slop. but mark, 'twas out of no
contempt of peireskius at all;--but that peireskius's indefatigable
labour in trudging so far on foot, out of love for the sciences, reduced
the exploit of dr. slop, in that affair, to nothing:--th
 
 ___________________________
 
 peireskius, or any man else, to be
abused for an appetite for that, or any other morsel of sound knowledge:
for notwithstanding i know nothing of the chariot in question, continued
he, the inventor of it must have had a very mechanical head; and tho'
i cannot guess upon what principles of philosophy he has atchieved
it;--yet certainly his machine has been constructed upon solid ones,
be they what they will, or it could not have answered at the rate my
brother mentions.

it answered, replied my uncle toby, as well, if not better; for, as
peireskius elegantly expresses it, speaking of the velocity of its
motion, tam citus erat, quam erat ventus; which, unless i have forgot my
latin, is, that it was as swift as the wind itself.

but pray, dr. slop, quoth my father, interrupting my uncle (tho' not
without begging pardon for it at the same time) upon what principles was
this self-same chariot set a-going?--upon very pretty principles to
be sure, replied dr. slop:--and i have often wondered, continue

the scheme is bad;--it is the consumption of
our products, as well as the manufactures of them, which gives bread to
the hungry, circulates trade,--brings in money, and supports the value
of our lands;--and tho', i own, if i was a prince, i would
generously recompense the scientifick head which brought forth such
contrivances;--yet i would as peremptorily suppress the use of them.

my father here had got into his element,--and was going on as
prosperously with his dissertation upon trade, as my uncle toby had
before, upon his of fortification;--but to the loss of much sound
knowledge, the destinies in the morning had decreed that no dissertation
of any kind should be spun by my father that day,--for as he opened his
mouth to begin the next sentence,

discourse had been exhausted without him, and was running into a new
channel.

him.

 gave the book a good sound
shake.

there is something falling out, however, said trim, an' please your
honour;--but it is not a chariot, or any thing like one:--prithee,
corporal, said my father, smiling, what is it then?--i think, answered
trim, stooping to take it up,--'tis more like a sermon,--for it begins
with a text of scripture, and the chapter and verse;--and then goes on,
not as a chariot, but like a sermon directly.

the company smiled.

i cannot conceive how it is possible, quoth my uncle toby, for such a
thing as a sermon to have got into my stevinus.

i think 'tis a sermon, replied trim:--but if it please your honours,
as it is a fair hand, i will read you a page;--for trim, you must know,
loved to hear himself read almost as well as talk.

i have ever a strong propensity, said my father, to look into things
which cross my way, by such strange fatalities as these;--and as we
have nothing better to do, at least till obadiah gets back, i shall be
obliged to you, brother, if dr. slop

has no objection to it, to order
the corporal to give us a page or two of it,--if he is as able to do it,
as he seems willing. an' please your honour, quoth trim, i officiated
two whole campaigns, in flanders, as clerk to the chaplain of the
regiment.--he can read it, quoth my uncle toby, as well as i can.--trim,
i assure you, was the best scholar in my company, and should have had
the next halberd, but for the poor fellow's misfortune. corporal trim
laid his hand upon his heart, and made an humble bow to his master; then
laying down his hat upon the floor, and taking up the sermon in his
left hand, in order to have his right at liberty,--he advanced, nothing
doubting, into the middle of the room, where he could best see, and be
best seen by his audience.

ide, as nature and the laws of gravity ordered
it,--but with the palm of it open and turned towards his audience, ready
to aid the sentiment in case it stood in need.

corporal trim's eyes and the muscles of his face were in full harmony
with the other parts of him;--he looked frank,--unconstrained,--
something assured,--but not bordering upon assurance.

let not the critic ask how corporal trim could come by all this.--i've
told him it should be explained;--but so he stood before my father, my
uncle toby, and dr. slop,--so swayed his body, so contrasted his limbs,
and with such an oratorical sweep throughout the whole figure,--a
statuary might have modelled from it;--nay, i doubt whether the oldest
fellow of a college,--or the hebrew professor himself, could have much
mended it.

trim made a bow, and read as follows:

 this treatment of him
has not done it already. but from whence, replied my father, have you
concluded so soon, dr. slop, that the writer is of our church?--for
aught i can see yet,--he may be of any church.--because, answered dr.
slop, if he was of ours,--he durst no more take such a licence,--than
a bear by his beard:--if, in our communion, sir, a man was to insult an
apostle,--a saint,--or even the paring of a saint's nail,--he would have
his eyes scratched out.--what, by the saint? quoth my uncle toby. no,
replied dr. slop, he would have an old house over his head. pray is
the inquisition an ancient building, answered my uncle toby, or is it
a modern one?--i know nothing of architecture, replied dr. slop.--an'
please your honours, quoth trim, the inquisition is the vilest--prithee
spare thy description, trim, i hate the very name of it, said my
father.--no matter for that, answered dr. slop,--it has its uses; for
tho' i'm no great advocate for it, yet, in such a case as this, he would

rate, would be flung into the inquisition for his pains. god help him
then, quoth my uncle toby. amen, added trim; for heaven above knows,
i have a poor brother who has been fourteen years a captive in it.--i
never heard one word of it before, said my uncle toby, hastily:--how
came he there, trim?--o, sir, the story will make your heart bleed,--as
it has made mine a thousand times;--but it is too long to be told
now;--your honour shall hear it from first to last some day when i am
working beside you in our fortifications;--but the short of the story
is this;--that my brother tom went over a servant to lisbon,--and then
married a jew's widow, who kept a small shop, and sold sausages, which
somehow or other, was the cause of his being taken in the middle

good, and that the man must be good also.'

(then the apostle is altogether in the wrong, i suppose, quoth dr. slop,
and the protestant divine is in the right. sir, have patience, replied
my father, for i think it will presently appear that st. paul and the
protestant divine are both of an opinion.--as nearly so, quoth dr. slop,
as east is to west;--but this, continued he, lifting both hands, comes
from the liberty of the press.

it is no more at the worst, replied my uncle toby, than the liberty of
the pulpit; for it does not appear that the sermon is printed, or ever
likely to be.

go on, trim, quoth my father.)

'at first sight this may seem to be a true state of the case: and i make
no doubt but the knowledge of right and wrong is so truly impressed
upon the mind of man,--that did no such thing ever happen, as that the
conscience of a man, by long habits of sin, might (as the scripture
assures it may) insensibly become hard;--and, like some tender parts of
his body

to my
father,--the case could not happen in our church.--it happens in ours,
however, replied my father, but too often.--i own, quoth dr. slop,
(struck a little with my father's frank acknowledgment)--that a man
in the romish church may live as badly;--but then he cannot easily
die so.--'tis little matter, replied my father, with an air of
indifference,--how a rascal dies.--i mean, answered dr. slop, he would
be denied the benefits of the last sacraments.--pray how many have you
in all, said my uncle toby,--for i always forget?--seven, answered
dr. slop.--humph!--said my uncle toby; tho' not accented as a note of
acquiescence,--but as an interjection of that particular species of
surprize, when a man in looking into a drawer, finds more of a thing
than he expected.--humph! replied my uncle toby. dr. slop, who had an
ear, understood my uncle toby as well as if he had wrote a whole volume
against the seven sacraments.--humph! replied dr. slop, (stating my
uncle toby's argument over again to him)--

why, sir, are there not seven
cardinal virtues?--seven mortal sins?--seven golden candlesticks?--seven

not seven wonders of the world?--seven days of the creation?--seven
planets?--seven plagues?--that there are, quoth my father with a most
affected gravity. but prithee, continued he, go on with the rest of thy
characters, trim.)

'another is sordid, unmerciful,' (here trim waved his right hand) 'a
strait-hearted, selfish wretch, incapable either of private friendship
or public spirit. take notice how he passes by the widow and orphan in
their distress, and sees all the miseries inci

 the statutes at large;--finds no express law broken by what
he has done;--perceives no penalty or forfeiture of goods and chattels
incurred;--sees no scourge waving over his head, or prison opening his
gates upon him:--what is there to affright his conscience?--conscience
has got safely entrenched behind the letter of the law; sits there
invulnerable, fortified with cases and reports so strongly on all
sides;--that it is not preaching can dispossess it of its hold.'

(here corporal trim and my uncle toby exchanged looks with each
other.--aye, aye, trim! quoth my uncle toby, shaking his head,--these
are but sorry fortifications, trim.--o! very poor work, answered trim,
to what your honour and i make of it.--the character of this last man,
said dr. slop, interrupting trim, is more detestable than all the rest;
and seems to have been taken from some pettifogging lawyer amongst
you:--amongst us, a man's conscience could not possibly continue so long
blinded,--three times in a year, at least, he mus

my father, or obadiah will have got back before thou has got to the
end of thy sermon.--'tis a very short one, replied trim.--i wish it was
longer, quoth my uncle toby, for i like it hugely.--trim went on.)

'a fourth man shall want even this refuge;--shall break through all
their ceremony of slow chicane;--scorns the doubtful workings of
secret plots and cautious trains to bring about his purpose:--see
the bare-faced villain, how he cheats, lies, perjures, robs,

the present case--the poor man was in the dark!--his priest had got the
keeping of his conscience;--and all he would let him know

e, and, by the terrors of gaols and
halters, oblige us to it.'

(i see plainly, said my father, that this sermon has been composed to be
preached at the temple,--or at some assize.--i like the reasoning,--and
am sorry that dr. slop has fallen asleep before the time of his
conviction:--for it is now clear, that the parson, as i thought at
first, never insulted st. paul in the least;--nor has there been,
brother, the least difference between them.--a great matter, if they
had differed, replied my uncle toby,--the best friends in the world may
differ sometimes.--true,--brother toby quoth my father, shaking hands
with him,--we'll fill our pipes, brother, and then trim shall go on.

well,--what dost thou think of it? said my father, speaking to corporal
trim, as he reached his tobacco-box.

i think, answered the corporal, that the seven watch-men upon the tower,
who, i suppose, are all centinels there,--are more, an' please your
honour, than were necessary;--and, to go on at that rate, would harrass

a regiment all to pieces, which a commanding officer, who loves his
men, will never do, if he can help it, because two centinels, added
the corporal, are as good as twenty.--i have been a commanding officer
myself in the corps de garde a hundred times, continued trim, rising
an inch higher in his figure, as he spoke,--and all the time i had
the honour to serve his majesty king william, in relieving the most
considerable posts, i never left more than two in my life.--very right,
trim, quoth my uncle toby,--but you do not consider, trim, that the
towers, in solomon's days, were not such things as our bastions,
flanked and defended by other works;--this, trim, was an invention since
solomon's death; nor had they horn-works, or ravelins before the curtin,
in his time;--or such a fosse as we make with a cuvette in the middle
of it, and with covered ways and counterscarps pallisadoed along it, to
guard against a coup de main:--so that the seven men upon the tower were

slop, looking towards trim, with something more of contempt than the
corporal's honest heart deserved.--what do you know, friend, about this
battle you talk of?--i know, replied trim, that i never refused quarter
in my life to any man who cried out for it;--but to a woman or a child,
continued trim, before i would level my musket at them, i would loose
my life a thousand times.--here's a crown for thee, trim, to drink with
obadiah to-night, quoth my uncle toby, and i'll give obadiah another
too.--god bless your honour, replied trim,--i had rather these poor
women and children had it.--thou art an honest fellow, quoth my uncle

but prithee, trim, said my father, make an end,--for i see thou hast but

clapping his hands together--i fear 'tis poor tom. my father's and my

the sentence again.)--'behold this helpless victim delivered up to his

concern,--'tis cruelty to force him to go on with it.--give me hold of
the sermon, trim,--i'll finish it for thee, and thou may'st go. i must
stay and hear it too, replied trim, if your honour will allow me;--tho'
i would not read it myself for a colonel's pay.--poor trim! quoth my
uncle toby. my father went on.)

know that very well, said my father,--but in a tone and manner which
disgusted dr. slop, full as much as his assent, simply, could have
pleased him.--but in this, added dr. slop, a little piqued,--our sermons
have greatly the advantage, that we never introduce any character
into them below a patriarch or a patriarch's wife, or a martyr or a
saint.--there are some very bad characters in this, however, said my
father, and i do not think the sermon a jot the worse for 'em.--but
pray, quoth my uncle toby,--who's can this be?--how could it get into my
stevinus? a man must be as great a conjurer as stevinus, said my
father, to resolve the second question:--the first, i think, is not
so difficult;--for unless my judgment greatly deceives me,--i know the
author, for 'tis wrote, certainly, by the parson of the parish.

the similitude of the stile and manner of it, with those my father
constantly had heard preached in his parish-church, was the ground of
his conjecture,--proving it as strongly, as an

 argument a priori could
prove such a thing to a philosophic mind, that it was yorick's and no
one's else:--it was proved to be so, a posteriori, the day after, when
yorick sent a servant to my uncle toby's house to enquire after it.

it seems that yorick, who was inquisitive after all kinds of knowledge,
had borrowed stevinus of my uncle toby, and had carelesly popped his
sermon, as soon as he had made it, into the middle of stevinus; and
by an act of forgetfulness, to which he was ever subject, he had sent
stevinus home, and his sermon to keep him company.

ill-fated sermon! thou wast lost, after this recovery of thee, a second

the lean old mother of a midwife above stairs cannot do without
you.--women have their particular fancies, and in points of this nature,
continued my father, where they bear the whole burden, and suffer so
much acute pain for the advantage of our families, and the good of
the species,--they claim a right of deciding, en souveraines, in whose
hands, and in what fashion, they choose to undergo it.

they are in the right of it,--quoth my uncle toby. but sir, replied dr.
slop, not taking notice of my uncle toby's opinion, but turning to my
father,--they had better govern in other points;--and a father of a
family, who wishes its perpetuity, in my opinion, had better exchange
this prerogative with them, and give up some other rights in lieu of
it.--i know not, quoth my father, answering a letter too testily, to be
quite dispassionate in what he said,--i know not, quoth he, what we have
left to give up, in lieu of who shall bring our childre

any thing, replied dr. slop.--i beg your pardon,--answered my uncle
toby.--sir, replied dr. slop, it would astonish you to know what
improvements we have made of late years in all branches of obstetrical
knowledge, but particularly in that one single point of the safe and
expeditious extraction of the foetus,--which has received such lights,
that, for my part (holding up his hand) i declare i wonder how the world
has--i wish, quoth my uncle toby, you had seen what prodigious armies we
had in flanders.

i have dropped the curtain over this scene for a minute,--to remind you
of one thing,--and to inform you of another.

what i have to inform you, comes, i own, a little out of its due
course;--for it should have been told a hundred and fifty pages ago,
but that i foresaw then 'twould come in pat hereafter, and be of more
advantage here than elsewhere.--writers had need look before them, to

when these two things are done,--the curtain shall be drawn up again,
and my uncle toby, my father, and dr. slop, shall go on with their
discourse, without any more interruption.

first, then, the matter which i have to remind you of, is this;--that
from the specimens of singularity in my father's notions in the point of
christian-names, and that other previous point thereto,--you was led, i
think, into an opinion,--(and i am sure i said as much) that my father
was a gentleman altogether as odd and whimsical in fifty other opinions.
in truth, there was not a stage in the life of m

now, from the best accounts he had been able to get of this matter, he
was satisfied it could not be where des cartes had fixed it, upon the
top of the pineal gland of the brain; which, as he philosophized, formed
a cushion for her about the size of a marrow pea; tho' to speak the
truth, as so many nerves did terminate all in that one place,--'twas
no bad conjecture;--and my father had certainly fallen with that great
philosopher plumb into the centre of the mistake, had it not been for
my uncle toby, who rescued him out of it, by a story he told him of a
walloon officer at the battle of landen, who had one part of his brain
shot away by a musket-ball,--and another part of it taken out after by
a french surgeon; and after all, recovered, and did his duty very well
without it.

if death, said my father, reasoning with himself, is nothing but the
separation of the soul from the body;--and if it is true that people can
walk about and do their business without brains,--then certes the soul

this will account for the coalition betwixt my father and dr. slop,
in the ensuing discourse, which went a little hard against my uncle
toby.--in what manner a plain man, with nothing but common sense, could
bear up against two such allies in science,--is hard to conceive.--you
may conjecture upon it, if you please,--and whilst your imagination is
in motion, you may encourage it to go on, and discover by what causes
and effects in nature it could come to pass, that my uncle toby got his
modesty by the wound he received upon his groin.--you may raise a system
to account for the loss of my nose by marriage-articles,--and shew
the world how it could happen, that i should have the misfortune to be
called tristram, in opposition to my father's hypothesis, and the wish
of the whole family, godfathers and godmothers not excepted.--these,
with fifty other points left yet unravelled, you may endeavour to solve
if you have time;--but i tell you beforehand it will be in vain, for

matters till the next year,--when a series of things will be laid open
which he little expects.



chapter 1.xlv.

--'i wish, dr. slop,' quoth my uncle toby, (repeating his wish for dr.
slop a second time, and with a degree of more zeal and earnestness in
his manner of wishing, than he had wished at first (vide.))--'i wish,
dr. slop,' quoth my uncle toby, 'you had seen what prodigious armies we
had in flanders.'

my uncle toby's wish did dr. slop a disservice which his heart never
intended any man,--sir, it confounded him--and thereby putting his ideas
first into confusion, and then to flight, he could not rally them again
for the soul of him.

was one of the most interesting disputes in the world, 'whether the
child of his prayers and endeavours should be born without a head or
with one:'--he waited to the last moment, to allow dr. slop, in whose
behalf the wish was made, his right of returning it; but perceiving, i
say, that he was confounded, and continued looking with that perplexed
vacuity of eye which puzzled souls generally stare with--first in my
uncle toby's face--then in his--then up--then down--then east--east and
by east, and so on,--coasting it along by the plinth of the wainscot
till he had got to the opposite point of the compass,--and that he had
actually begun to count the brass nails upon the arm of his chair,--my
father thought there was no time to be lost with my uncle toby, so took
up the discourse as follows.

it was not an easy matter in any king's reign (unless you were as lean
a subject as myself) to have forced your hand diagonally, quite
across your whole body, so as to gain the bottom of your opposite coat
pocket.--in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighteen, when
this happened, it was extremely difficult; so that when my uncle toby
discovered the transverse zig-zaggery of my father's approaches towards
it, it instantly brought into his mind those he had done duty in, before
the gate of st. nicolas;--the idea of which drew off his attention so
intirely from the subject in debate, that he had got his right hand
to the bell to ring up trim to go and fetch his map of namur, and his
compasses and sector along with it, to measure the returning angles of
the traverses of that attack,--but particularly of that one, where he

been a lover of such kind of concord as arises from two such instruments

interpreted every motion of the body in the kindest sense the motion

him too. my uncle toby blamed nothing but the taylor who cut the
pocket-hole;--so sitting still till my father had got his handkerchief
out of it, and looking all the time up in his face with inexpressible
good-will--my father, at length, went on as follows.

'what prodigious armies you had in flanders!'

man, and with as good and as upright a heart as ever god created;--nor
is it thy fault, if all the children which have been, may,

the world:--but believe me, dear toby, the accidents which unavoidably
way-lay them, not only in the article of our begetting 'em--though
these, in my opinion, are well worth considering,--but the dangers and
difficulties our children are beset with, after they are got forth into
the world, are enow--little need is there to expose them to unnecessary
ones in their passage to it.--are these dangers, quoth my uncle toby,
laying his hand upon my father's knee, and looking up seriously in his
face for an answer,--are these dangers greater now o'days, brother,
than in times past? brother toby, answered my father, if a child was but
fairly begot, and born alive, and healthy, and the mother did well after
it,--our forefathers never looked farther.--my uncle toby instantly
withdrew his hand from off my father's knee, reclined his body gently
back in his chair, raised his head till he could just see the cornice of

whistling) fired against a bastion.--they serve, continued my father,
to stir the humours--but carry off none of their acrimony:--for my own
part, i seldom swear or curse at all--i hold it bad--but if i fall into
it by surprize, i generally retain so much presence of mind (right,
quoth my uncle toby) as to make it answer my purpose--that is, i swear
on till i find myself easy. a wife and a just man however would always

world for that gentleman, who, in distrust of his own discretion in
this point, sat down and composed (that is at his leisure) fit forms
of swearing suitable to all cases, from the lowest to the highest
provocation which could possibly happen to him--which forms being well
considered by him, and such moreover as he could stand to, he kept them

was curious in his collections) had procured out of the leger-book

most affected seriousness of look and voice, which might have cajoled
ernulphus himself--he put it into dr. slop's hands.--dr. slop wrapt his
thumb up in the corner of his handkerchief, and with a wry face, though
without any suspicion, read aloud, as follows--my uncle toby whistling
lillabullero as loud as he could all the time.

(as the geniuneness of the consultation of the sorbonne upon the
question of baptism, was doubted by some, and denied by others--'twas
thought proper to print the original of this excommunication; for the
copy of which mr. shandy returns thanks to the chapter clerk of the dean
and chapter of rochester.)

e is no necessity, quoth dr.
slop, dropping the paper down to his knee, and addressing himself to my
father--as you have read it over, sir, so lately, to read it aloud--and
as captain shandy seems to have no great inclination to hear it--i
may as well read it to myself. that's contrary to treaty, replied my
father:--besides, there is something so whimsical, especially in the
latter part of it, i should grieve to lose the pleasure of a second
reading. dr. slop did not altogether like it,--but my uncle toby
offering at that instant to give over whistling, and read it himself to
them;--dr. slop thought he might as well read it under the cover of my
uncle toby's whistling--as suffer my uncle toby to read it alone;--so
raising up the paper to his face, and holding it quite parallel to it,
in order to hide his chagrin--he read it aloud as follows--my uncle toby
whistling lillabullero, though not quite so loud as before.

'may he (obadiah) be damn'd wherever he be--whether in the house or the
stables, the garden or the field, or the highway, or in the path, or
in the wood, or in the water, or in the church.--may he be cursed in

in the second bar of his tune, kept whistling one continued note to the
end of the sentence.--dr. slop, with his division of curses moving under
him, like a running bass all the way.) 'may he be cursed in eating and
drinking, in being hungry, in being thirsty, in fasting, in sleeping, in
slumbering, in walking, in standing, in sitting, in lying, in working,
in resting, in pissing, in shitting, and in blood-letting!

worth in the world, i would have given the better of them, as freely as
ever cid hamet offered his--to have stood by, and heard my uncle toby's

powers which move therein, rise up against him, curse and damn him'
(obadiah) 'unless he repent and make satisfaction! amen. so be it,--so
be it. amen.'

i declare, quoth my uncle toby, my heart would not let me curse the
devil himself with so much bitterness.--he is the father of curses,
replied dr. slop.--so am not i, replied my uncle.--but he is cursed, and
damn'd already, to all eternity, replied dr. slop.

affair.

chapter 2.viii.

dr. slop was within an ace of being an exception to all this
argumentation: for happening to have his green baize bag upon his knees,
when he began to parody my uncle toby--'twas as good as the best mantle
in the world to him: for which purpose, when he foresaw the sentence
would end in his new-invented forceps, he thrust his hand into the bag
in order to have them ready to clap in, when your reverences took so
much notice of the..., which had he managed--my uncle toby had certainly
been overthrown: the sentence and the argument in that case jumping
closely in one point, so like the two lines which form the salient angle
of a ravelin,--dr. slop would never have g

 as taking them by force: but
dr. slop fumbled so vilely in pulling them out, it took off the whole
effect, and what was a ten times worse evil (for they seldom come alone
in this life) in pulling out his forceps, his forceps unfortunately drew
out the squirt along with it.

when a proposition can be taken in two senses--'tis a law in
disputation, that the respondent may reply to which of the two he
pleases, or finds most convenient for him.--this threw the advantage of
the argument quite on my uncle toby's side.--'good god!' cried my uncle
toby, 'are children brought into the world with a squirt?'



chapter 2.ix.

--upon my honour, sir, you have tore every bit of skin quite off the
back of both my hands with your forceps, cried my uncle toby--and you
have crush'd all my knuckles into the bargain with them to a jelly. 'tis
your own fault, said dr. slop--you should have clinch'd your two fists
together into the form of a child's head as i told you, and sat firm.--i
did so, answered my uncle toby

.--it would not have been a
cherry-stone the worse, answered dr. slop.--i maintain it, said my uncle
toby, it would have broke the cerebellum (unless indeed the skull
had been as hard as a granado) and turn'd it all into a perfect
posset.--pshaw! replied dr. slop, a child's head is naturally as soft
as the pap of an apple;--the sutures give way--and besides, i could
have extracted by the feet after.--not you, said she.--i rather wish you
would begin that way, quoth my father.

pray do, added my uncle toby.



chapter 2.x.

--and pray, good woman, after all, will you take upon you to say, it
may not be the child's hip, as well as the child's head?--'tis most
certainly the head, replied the midwife. because, continued dr. slop
(turning to my father) as positive as these old ladies generally
are--'tis a point very difficult to know--and yet of the greatest
consequence to be known;--because, sir, if the hip is mistaken for the
head--there is a possibility (if it is a boy) that the forceps....

--wha
 
 ___________________________
 
t the possibility was, dr. slop whispered very low to my father,
and then to my uncle toby.--there is no such danger, continued he, with
the head.--no, in truth quoth my father--but when your possibility has
taken place at the hip--you may as well take off the head too.

--it is morally impossible the reader should understand this--'tis
enough dr. slop understood it;--so taking the green baize bag in his
hand, with the help of obadiah's pumps, he tripp'd pretty nimbly, for
a man of his size, across the room to the door--and from the door was
shewn the way, by the good old midwife, to

it, and my pantoufles too.

now, sir, they are all at your service; and i freely make you a present
of 'em, on condition you give me all your attention to this chapter.

though my father said, 'he knew not how it happen'd,'--yet he knew
very well how it happen'd;--and at the instant he spoke it, was
pre-determined in his mind to give my uncle toby a clear account of the
matter by a metaphysical dissertation upon the subject of duration and
its simple modes, in order to shew my uncle toby by what mechanism and
mensurations in the brain it came to pass, that the rapid succession of
their ideas, and the eternal scampering of the discourse from one thing
to another, since dr. slop had come into the room, had lengthened out
so short a period to so inconceivable an extent.--'i know not how it
happens--cried my father,--but it seems an age.'

-'tis owing entirely, quoth my uncle toby, to the succession of our
ideas.

my father, who had an itch, in common with all philosophers, of
reasoning upon every thing which happened, and accounting for it
too--proposed infinite pleasure to himself in this, of the succession of
ideas, and had not the least apprehension of having it snatch'd out of
his hands by my uncle toby, who (honest man!) generally took every thing
as it happened;--and who, of all things in the world, troubled his brain
the least with abstruse thinking;--the ideas of time and space--or how
we came by those ideas--or of what stuff they were made--or whether they
were born with us--or we picked them up afterwards as we went along--or
whether we did it in frocks--or not till we had got into breeches--with
a thousand other inquiries and disputes about infinity prescience,
liberty, necessity, and s

o forth, upon whose desperate and unconquerable
theories so many fine heads have been turned and cracked--never did my
uncle toby's the least injury at all; my father knew it--and was no less
surprized than he was disappointed, with my uncle's fortuitous solution.

do you understand the theory of that affair? replied my father.

not i, quoth my uncle.

--but you have some ideas, said my father, of what you talk about?

no more than my horse, replied my uncle toby.

gracious heaven! cried my father, looking upwards, and clasping his
two hands together--there is a worth in thy honest ignorance, brother
toby--'twere almost a pity to exchange it for a knowledge.--but i'll
tell thee.--

to understand what time is aright, without which we never can comprehend
infinity, insomuch as one is a portion of the other--we ought seriously
to sit down and consider what idea it is we have of duration, so as
to give a satisfactory account how we came by it.--what is that

you will perceive, brother, that whilst you and i are talking together,
and thinking, and smoking our pipes, or whilst we receive successively
ideas in our minds, we know that we do exist, and so we estimate the
existence, or the continuation of the existence of ourselves, or any
thing else, commensurate to the succession of any ideas in our minds,
the duration of ourselves, or an

cried my uncle toby.

--'tis owing to this, replied my father, that in our computations of
time, we are so used to minutes, hours, weeks, and months--and of clocks
(i wish there was not a clock in the kingdom) to measure out their
several portions to us, and to those who belong to us--that 'twill be
well, if in time to come, the succession of our ideas be of any use or
service to us at all.

now, whether we observe it or no, continued my father, in every sound
man's head, there is a regular succession of ideas of

which follow each other in train just like--a train of artillery? said
my uncle toby--a train of a fiddle-stick!--quoth my father--which follow

the images in the inside of a lanthorn turned round by the heat of
a candle.--i declare, quoth my uncle toby, mine are more like a
smoke-jack,--then, brother toby, i have nothing more to say to you upon
that subject, said my father.

explanatory moods--in eager pursuit of a metaphysical point into
the very regions, where clouds and thick darkness would soon have
encompassed it about;--my uncle toby in one of the finest dispositions
for it in the world;--his head like a smoke-jack;--the funnel unswept,

darkened over with fuliginous matter!--by the tomb-stone of lucian--if
it is in being--if not, why then by his ashes! by the ashes of my dear
rabelais, and dearer cervantes!--my father and my uncle toby's discourse
upon time and eternity--was a discourse devoutly to be wished for! and
the petulancy of my father's humour, in putting a stop to it as he did,
was a robbery of the ontologic treasury of such a jewel, as no coalition
of great occasions and great men are ever likely to restore to it again.

could not get my uncle toby's smoke-jack out of his head--piqued as

his faculties upon that variety of subjects which had taken their turn

the moment he had beheld my father and my uncle toby fast asleep--the
respectfulness of his carriage was such, he would have retired as silent
as death, and left them both in their arm-chairs, dreaming as happy
as he had found them: but the thing was, morally speaking, so very
impracticable, that for the many years in which this hinge was suffered
to be out of order, and amongst the hourly grievances my father

as he swore--i have not one appointment belonging to me, which i set
so much store by as i do by these jack-boots--they were our great
grandfather's brother toby--they were hereditary. then i fear, quoth my

man alive, cried my father--but these jack-boots, continued he (smiling,
though very angry at the same time) have been in the family, brother,
ever since the civil wars;--sir roger shandy wore them at the battle
of marston-moor.--i declare i would not have taken ten pounds for
them.--i'll pay you the money, brother shandy, quoth my uncle toby,

upon a siege.--have i not one hundred and twenty pounds a year, besides
my half pay? cried my uncle toby.--what is that--replied my father
hastily--to ten pounds for a pair of jack-boots?--twelve guineas for
your pontoons?--half as much for your dutch draw-bridge?--to say nothing
of the train of little brass artillery you bespoke last week, with
twenty other preparations for the siege of messina: believe me, dear
brother toby, continued my father, taking him kindly by the hand--these

the nation?--

my father could not help smiling for his soul--his anger at the worst
was never more than a spark;--and the zeal and simplicity of trim--and
the generous (though hobby-horsical) gallantry of my uncle toby, brought
him into perfect good humour with them in an instant.

you.--what can the fellow be puzzling about in the kitchen!--he is busy,

dr. slop, trim, and tell him i thank him heartily.

you must know, my uncle toby mistook the bridge--as widely as my father
mistook the mortars:--but to understand how my uncle toby could mistake
the bridge--i fear i must give you an exact account of the road which
led to it;--or to drop my metaphor (for there is nothing more dishonest
in an historian than the use of one)--in order to conceive the
probability of this error in my uncle toby aright, i must give y

account of an adventure of trim's, though much against my will, i say
much against my will, only because the story, in one sense, is certainly
out of its place here; for by right it should come in, either amongst
the anecdotes of my uncle toby's amours with widow wadman, in which
corporal trim was no mean actor--or else in the middle of his and my
uncle toby's campaigns on the bowling-green--for it will do very well in
either place;--but then if i reserve it for either of those parts of my
story--i ruin the story i'm upon;--and if i tell it here--i anticipate
matters, and ruin it there.

--what would your worship have me to do in this case?

--tell it, mr. shandy, by all means.--you are a fool, tristram, if you
do.

chapter 2.xvii.

tho' the shock my uncle toby received the year after the demolition of
dunkirk, in his affair with widow wadman, had fixed him in a resolution
never more to think of the sex--or of aught which belonged to it;--yet
corporal trim had made no such bargain with himself. indeed in my
uncle toby's case there was a strange and unaccountable concurrence of
circumstances, which insensibly drew him in, to lay siege to that fair
and strong citadel.--in trim's case there was a concurrence of nothing
in the world, but of him and bridge

t in the kitchen;--though in truth,
the love and veneration he bore his master was such, and so fond was he
of imitating him in all he did, that had my uncle toby employed his
time and genius in tagging of points--i am persuaded the honest corporal
would have laid down his arms, and followed his example with pleasure.
when therefore my uncle toby sat down before the mistress--corporal trim
incontinently took ground before the maid.

now, my dear friend garrick, whom i have so much cause to esteem
and honour--(why, or wherefore, 'tis no matter)--can it escape your
penetration--i defy it--that so many play-wrights, and opificers of
chit-chat have ever since been working upon trim's and my uncle toby's
pattern.--i care not what aristotle, or pacuvius, or bossu, or

than betwixt a single amour, and an amour thus nobly doubled, and going

silly affair of that kind--is quite lost in five acts--but that is
neither here nor there.

after a series of attacks and repulses in a course of nine months on my
uncle toby's quarter, a most minute account of every particular of which
shall be given in its proper place, my uncle toby, honest man! found
it necessary to draw off his forces and raise the siege somewhat
indignantly.

corporal trim, as i said, had made no such bargain either with
himself--or with any one else--the fidelity however of his heart not
suffering him to go into a house which his master had forsaken with
disgust--he contented himself with turning his part of the siege into a
blockade;--that is, he kept others off;--for though he never after went
to the house, yet he never met bridget in the village, bu

precisely in this situation, did these things stand for five years; that
is from the demolition of dunkirk in the year 13, to the latter end of
my uncle toby's campaign in the year 18, which was about six or seven
weeks before the time i'm speaking of.--when trim, as his custom was,
after he had put my uncle toby to bed, going down one moon-shiny night
to see that every thing was right at his fortifications--in the lane
separated from the bowling-green with flowering shrubs and holly--he
espied his bridget.

as the corporal thought there was nothing in the world so well worth
shewing as the glorious works which he and my uncle toby had made, trim

urteously and gallantly took her by the hand, and led her in: this was
not done so privately, but that the foul-mouth'd trumpet of fame carried
it from ear to ear, till at length it reach'd my father's, with this
untoward circumstance along with it, that my uncle toby's curious
draw-bridge, constructed and painted after the dutch fashion, and
which went quite across the ditch--was broke down, and somehow or other
crushed all to pieces that very night.

my father, as you have observed, had no great esteem for my uncle toby's
hobby-horse; he thought it the most ridiculous horse that ever gentleman
mounted; and indeed unless my uncle toby vexed him about it, could never
think of it once, without smiling at it--so that it could never get lame

ance, but it tickled my father's imagination beyond
measure; but this being an accident much more to his humour than any
one which had yet befall'n it, it proved an inexhaustible fund of
entertainment to him--well--but dear toby! my father would say, do tell
me seriously how this affair of the bridge happened.--how can you teaze
me so much about it? my uncle toby would reply--i have told it you
twenty times, word for word as trim told it me.--prithee, how was it
then, corporal? my father would cry, turning to trim.--it was a mere
misfortune, an' please your honour;--i was shewing mrs. bridget
our fortifications, and in going too near the edge of the fosse, i
unfortunately slipp'd in--very well, trim! my father would cry--(smiling
mysteriously, and giving a nod--but without interrupting him)--and being
link'd fast, an' please your honour, arm in arm with

 mrs. bridget, i
dragg'd her after me, by means of which she fell backwards soss against
the bridge--and trim's foot (my uncle toby would cry, taking the story
out of his mouth) getting into the cuvette, he tumbled full against the
bridge too.--it was a thousand to one, my uncle toby would add, that
the poor fellow did not break his leg.--ay truly, my father would say--a
limb is soon broke, brother toby, in such encounters.--and so, an'
please your honour, the bridge, which your honour knows was a very
slight one, was broke down betwixt us, and splintered all to pieces.

at other times, but especially when my uncle toby was so unfortunate
as to say a syllable about cannons, bombs, or petards--my father would
exhaust all the stores of his eloquence (which indeed were very gr

in a panegyric upon the battering-rams of the ancients--the vinea which
alexander made use of at the siege of troy.--he would tell my uncle toby
of the catapultae of the syrians, which threw such monstrous stones
so many hundred feet, and shook the strongest bulwarks from their very
foundation:--he would go on and describe the wonderful mechanism of
the ballista which marcellinus makes so much rout about!--the terrible
effects of the pyraboli, which cast fire;--the danger of the terebra and
scorpio, which cast javelins.--but what are these, would he say, to the
destructive machinery of corporal trim?--believe me, brother toby, no

, or bastion, or sally-port, that ever was constructed in this
world, can hold out against such artillery.

my uncle toby would never attempt any defence against the force of this
ridicule, but that of redoubling the vehemence of smoaking his pipe; in
doing which, he raised so dense a vapour one night after supper, that
it set my father, who was a little phthisical, into a suffocating fit of
violent coughing: my uncle toby leap'd up without feeling the pain upon
his groin--and, with infinite pity, stood beside his brother's chair,
tapping his back with one hand, and holding his head with the other, and
from time to time wiping his eyes with a clean cambrick handkerchief,
which he pulled out of his pocket.--the affectionate and endearing
manner in which my uncle toby did these little offices--cut my father
thro' his reins, for the pain he had just been giving him.--may my
brains be knock'd out with a battering-ram

chapter 2.xviii.

the draw-bridge being held irreparable, trim was ordered directly to
set about another--but not upon the same model: for cardinal alberoni's
intrigues at that time being discovered, and my uncle toby rightly
foreseeing that a flame would inevitably break out betwixt spain and
the empire, and that the operations of the ensuing campaign must in all
likelihood be either in naples or sicily--he determined upon an
italian bridge--(my uncle toby, by-the-bye, was not far out of his
conjectures)--but my father, who was infinitely the better politician,
and took the lead as far of my uncle toby in the cabinet, as my uncle
toby took it of him in the field--convinced him, that if the king of
spain and
 
 ___________________________
 
 the emperor went together by the ears, england and france and
holland must, by force of their pre-engagements, all enter the lists
too;--and if so, he would say, the combatants, brother toby, as sure
as we are alive, will fall to it again, pell-mell, upon the old
prize-fighting stage of flanders;--then what will you do with your
italian bridge?

--we will go on with it then upon the old model, cried my uncle toby.

when corporal trim had about half finished it in that style--my uncle
toby found out a capital defect in it, which he had never thoroughly
considered before. it turned, it seems, upon hinges at both ends of
it, opening in the middle, one half of which turning to one side of the
fosse, and the other to the other; the advantage of which was this,
that by dividing the weight of the bridge into two equal portions, it
impowered my uncle toby to raise it up or let it down with the end of
his crutch

inges, so that the whole might be lifted up together,
and stand bolt upright--but that was rejected for the reason given
above.

for a whole week after he was determined in his mind to have one of
that particular construction which is made to draw back horizontally,
to hinder a passage; and to thrust forwards again to gain a passage--of
which sorts your worship might have seen three famous ones at spires
before its destruction--and one now at brisac, if i mistake not;--but my
father advising my uncle toby, with great earnestness, to have nothing
more to do with thrusting bridges--and my uncle foreseeing moreover
that it would but perpetuate the memory of the corporal's misfortune--he
changed his mind for that of the marquis d'hopital's invention, which
the younger bernouilli has so well and learnedly described, as your
worships may see--act. erud. lips. an. 1695--to these a lead weight is
an eternal balance, and keeps watch as well as a couple of centinels,
inasmuch as the construction of them w

my uncle toby understood the nature of a parabola as well as any man
in england--but was not quite such a master of the cycloid;--he talked
however about it every day--the bridge went not forwards.--we'll ask
somebody about it, cried my uncle toby to trim.



chapter 2.xix.

when trim came in and told my father, that dr. slop was in the kitchen,
and busy in making a bridge--my uncle toby--the affair of the jack-boots
having just then raised a train of military ideas in his brain--took it
instantly for granted that dr. slop was making a model of the marquis
d'hopital's bridge.--'tis very obliging in him, quoth my uncle
toby;--pray give my humble service to dr. slop, trim, and tell him i
thank him heartily.

had my uncle toby's head been a savoyard's box, and my father peeping
in all the time at one end of it--it could not have given him a more
distinct conception of the operatio

ns of my uncle toby's imagination,
than what he had; so, notwithstanding the catapulta and battering-ram,
and his bitter imprecation about them, he was just beginning to
triumph--

when trim's answer, in an instant, tore the laurel from his brows, and
twisted it to pieces.



chapter 2.xx.

honour, cried trim, 'tis a bridge for master's nose.--in bringing him

 which peep'd out beyond the valance--his
right leg (his left being drawn up towards his body) hung half over the
side of the bed, the edge of it pressing upon his shin bone--he felt
it not. a fix'd, inflexible sorrow took possession of every line of his
face.--he sigh'd once--heaved his breast often--but uttered not a word.

an old set-stitch'd chair, valanced and fringed around with party
coloured worsted bobs, stood at the bed's head, opposite to the side
where my father's head reclined.--my uncle toby sat him down in it.

before an affliction is digested--consolation ever comes too soon;--and
after it is digested--it comes too late: so that you see, madam,
there is but a mark between these two, as fine almost as a hair, for a
comforter to take aim at:--my uncle toby was always either on this side,
or on that of it, and would often say, he believed in his heart he could
as soon hit the longitude; for this reason, when he sat down in the
chair, he drew the curtain a little forwards, and having

no doubt, the breaking down of the bridge of a child's nose, by the edge
of a pair of forceps--however scientifically applied--would vex any
man in the world, who was at so much pains in begetting a child, as
my father was--yet it will not account for the extravagance of his
affliction, nor will it justify the un-christian manner he abandoned and
surrendered himself up to.

to explain this, i must leave him upon the bed for half an hour--and my
uncle toby in his old fringed chair sitting beside him.

for it.--

king them up, and the more they
lay out of the common way, the better still was his title.--no mortal
claimed them; they had cost him moreover as much labour in cooking and
digesting as in the case above, so that they might well and truly be
said to be of his own goods and chattels.--accordingly he held fast by
'em, both by teeth and claws--would fly to whatever he could lay his
hands on--and, in a word, would intrench and fortify them round with
as many circumvallations and breast-works, as my uncle toby would a
citadel.

there was one plaguy rub in the way of this--the scarcity of materials
to make any thing of a defence with, in case of a smart attack; inasmuch
as few men of great genius had exercised their parts in writing books
upon the subject of great noses: by the trotting of my lean horse, the
thing is incredible! and i am quite lost in my understanding, when i am
considering what a treasure of precious time and talents together has
been wasted upon worse subjects--and how many millions

and though my father would oft-times sport with my uncle toby's
library--which, by-the-bye, was ridiculous enough--yet at the very same
time he did it, he collected every book and treatise which had been
systematically wrote upon noses, with as much care as my honest uncle
toby had done those upon military architecture.--'tis true, a much less
table would have held them--but that was not thy transgression, my dear

which the capacities of affording such exquisite scenes, and the powers
of shifting them perpetually from morning to night, were lodged and
intrusted with so unlimited a confidence, as in the shandy family.

not any one of these was more diverting, i say, in this whimsical
theatre of ours--than what frequently arose out of this self-same
chapter of long noses--especially when my father's imagination was
heated with the enquiry, and nothing would serve him but to heat my
uncle toby's too.

my uncle toby would give my father all possible fair play in this
attempt; and with infinite patience would sit smoking his pipe for
whole hours together, whilst my father was practising upon his head,
and trying every accessible avenue to drive prignitz and scroderus's
solutions into it.

that his brain was like damp timber, and no spark could possibly take
hold--or that it was so full of saps, mines, blinds, curtins

military disqualifications to his seeing clearly into prignitz and
scroderus's doctrines--i say not--let schoolmen--scullions, anatomists,
and engineers, fight for it among themselves--

'twas some misfortune, i make no doubt, in this affair, that my father
had every word of it to translate for the benefit of my uncle toby,
and render out of slawkenbergius's latin, of which, as he was no great
master, his translation was not always of the purest--and generally
least so where 'twas most wanted.--this naturally open'd a door to a
second misfortune;--that in the warmer paroxysms of his zeal to open
my uncle toby's eyes--my father's ideas ran on as much faster than the
translation, as the translation outmoved my uncle toby's--neither the
one or the other added much to the perspicuity of my father's lecture.

principal act of ratiocination in man, as logicians tell us, is the
finding out the agreement or disagreement of two ideas one with another,
by the intervention of a third (called the medius terminus); just as a
man, as locke well observes, by a yard, finds two mens nine-pin-alleys
to be of the same length, which could not be brought together, to
measure their equality, by juxta-position.

had the same great reasoner looked on, as my father illustrated his
systems of noses, and observed my uncle toby's deportment--what great
attention he gave to every word--and as oft as he took his pipe from
his mouth, with what wonderful seriousness he contemplated the length of
it--surveying it transversely as he held it betwixt his finger and
his thumb--then fore-right--then this way, and then that, in all its
possible directions and fore-shortenings--he would have concluded my
uncle toby had got hold of the medius terminus, and was syllogizing and
measuring with it the truth of each hypothesis of long

noses, in order,
as my father laid them before him. this, by-the-bye, was more than my
father wanted--his aim in all the pains he was at in these philosophick
lectures--was to enable my uncle toby not to discuss--but comprehend--to
hold the grains and scruples of learning--not to weigh them.--my uncle
toby, as you will read in the next chapter, did neither the one or the
other.

'tis a pity, cried my father one winter's night, after a three hours
painful translation of slawkenbergius--'tis a pity, cried my father,
putting my mother's threadpaper into the book for a mark, as he
spoke--that truth, brother toby, should shut herself up in such
impregnable fastnesses, and

be so obstinate as not to surrender herself
sometimes up upon the closest siege.--

now it happened then, as indeed it had often done before, that my uncle
toby's fancy, during the time of my father's explanation of prignitz to
him--having nothing to stay it there, had taken a short flight to the
bowling-green;--his body might as well have taken a turn there too--so
that with all the semblance of a deep school-man intent upon the medius
terminus--my uncle toby was in fact as ignorant of the whole lecture,
and all its pros and cons, as if my father had been translating hafen
slawkenbergius from the latin tongue into the cherokee. but the word
siege, like a talismanic power, in my father's metaphor, wafting back
my uncle toby's fancy, quick as a note could follow the touch--he open'd
his ears--and my father observing that he took his pipe out of his
mouth, and shuffled his chair nearer the table, as with a desire to
profit--my father with great pleasur

to the door--jerked it open--thrust his head half way
out--shut the door again--took no notice of the bad hinge--returned
to the table--pluck'd my mother's thread-paper out of slawkenbergius's
book--went hastily to his bureau--walked slowly back--twisted my
mother's thread-paper about his thumb--unbutton'd his waistcoat--threw
my mother's thread-paper into the fire--bit her sattin pin-cushion in
two, fill'd his mouth with bran--confounded it;--but mark!--the oath of
confusion was levell'd at my uncle toby's brain--which was e'en confused
enough already--the curse came charged only with the bran--the bran, may
it please your honours, was no more than powder to the ball.

'twas well my father's passions lasted not long; for so long as they
did last, they led him a busy life on't; and it is one of the most
unaccountable problems that ever i met with in my observations of human
nature, that nothing should prove my father's mettle so much, or make
his passions go off so like gun-powder, as the unexpe

his science met with from the quaint simplicity of my uncle toby's
questions.--had ten dozen of hornets stung him behind in so many
different places all at one time--he could not have exerted more
mechanical functions in fewer seconds--or started half so much, as with
one single quaere of three words unseasonably popping in full upon him
in his hobby-horsical career.

'twas all one to my uncle toby--he smoked his pipe on with unvaried
composure--his heart never intended offence to his brother--and as his
head could seldom find out where the sting of it lay--he always gave
my father the credit of cooling by himself.--he was five minutes and
thirty-five seconds about it in the present case.

taking the oath out of ernulphus's digest of curses--(though to do my

the aids of philosophy, which befriend one so much as they do--you would

i was telling you, i meant, as you might have known, had you favoured me
with one grain of attention, the various accounts which learned men of
different kinds of knowledge have given the world of the causes of short
and long noses.--there is no cause but one, replied my uncle toby--why
one man's nose is longer than another's, but because that god pleases to
have it so.--that is grangousier's solution, said my father.--'tis
he, continued my uncle toby, looking up, and not regarding my father's
interruption, who makes us all, and frames and puts us together in
such forms and proportions, and for such ends, as is agreeable to
his infinite wisdom,.--'tis a pious account, cried my father, but not

my father lay stretched across the bed as still as if the hand of death
had pushed him down, for a full hour and a half before he began to play
upon the floor with the toe of that foot which hung over the bed-side;
my uncle toby's heart was a pound lighter for it.--in a few moments,
his left-hand, the knuckles of which had all the time reclined upon the
handle of the chamber-pot, came to its feeling--he thrust it a little
more within the valance--drew up his hand, when he had done, into his
bosom--gave a hem! my good uncle toby, with infinite pleasure, answered
it; and full gladly would have ingrafted a sentence of consolation upon
the opening it afforded: but having no talents, as i said, that way, and

upon the cross of his crutch.

now whether the compression shortened my uncle toby's face into a more
pleasurable oval--or that the philanthropy of his heart, in seeing
his brother beginning to emerge out of the sea of his afflictions,
had braced up his muscles--so that the compression upon his chin only
doubled the benignity which was there before, is not hard to decide.--my
father, in turning his eyes, was struck with such a gleam of sun-shine
in his face, as melted down the sullenness of his grief in a moment.

he broke silence as follows:

cried my father, receive so many lashes?--the most i ever saw given,

he spoke--to think of two virtuous lads with hearts as warm in their

world--and fall into such evils!--poor tom! to be tortured upon a rack

replied the corporal, brightening up his face--your honour knows i have

goodness of thy heart i have had such proofs of--whilst thy master is
worth a shilling--thou shalt never ask elsewhere, trim, for a penny.
trim attempted to thank my uncle toby--but had not power--tears trickled
down his cheeks faster than he could wipe them off--he laid his hands
upon his breast--made a bow to the ground, and shut the door.

--i have left trim my bowling-green, cried my uncle toby--my father
smiled.--i have left him moreover a pension, continued my uncle

trim left the room, and my father found himself disposed to rise off
the bed--he had all the little preparatory movements to run over again,
before he could do it. attitudes are nothing, madam--'tis the transition
from one attitude to another--like the preparation and resolution of the

for which reason my father played the same jig over again with his toe
upon the floor--pushed the chamber-pot still a little farther within
the valance--gave a hem--raised himself up upon his elbow--and was just
beginning to address himself to my uncle toby--when recollecting the
unsuccessfulness of his first effort in that attitude--he got upon his
legs, and in making the third turn across the room, he stopped short
before my uncle toby; and laying the three first fingers of his
right-hand in the palm of his left, and stooping a little, he addressed
himself to my uncle toby as follows:

cross-reckonings and sorrowful items with which the heart of man is
overcharged, 'tis wonderful by what hidden resources the mind is enabled
to stand out, and bear itself up, as it does, against the impositions
laid upon our nature.--'tis by the assistance of almighty god, cried
my uncle toby, looking up, and pressing the palms of his hands close
together--'tis not from our own strength,

give me leave to lead you, brother toby, a little deeper into the
mystery.

with all my heart, replied my uncle toby.

my father instantly exchanged the attitude he was in, for that in which
socrates is so finely painted by raffael in his school of athens; which
your connoisseurship knows is so exquisitely imagined, that even the
particular manner of the reasoning of socrates is expressed by it--for
he holds the fore-finger of his left-hand between the fore-finger and
the thumb of his right, and seems as if he was saying to the libertine
he is reclaiming--'you grant me this--and this: and this, and this, i

and how gladly would i write such another to avail myself of thy
immortality, and secure my own behind it.

go his finger, and striking one hand against the other.--it makes every
thing straight for us, answered my uncle toby.--figuratively speaking,
dear toby, it may, for aught i know, said my father; but the spring i
am speaking of, is that great and elastic power within us of
counterbalancing evil, which, like a secret spring in a well-ordered
machine, though it can't prevent the shock--at least it imposes upon our
sense of it.

landing in order to set his back against the wall, whilst he propounded

state,--of which you may trust me, brother toby, there are more asses
loads than all job's stock of asses could have carried--there is not one
that has more intricacies in it than this--that from the very moment
the mistress of the house is brought to bed, every female in it, from my
lady's gentlewoman down to the cinder-wench, becomes an inch taller for
it; and give themselves more airs upon that single inch, than all their
other inches put

uncle toby--'tis a piteous burden upon 'em, continued he, shaking his

too--but certainly since shaking of heads came into fashion, never did
two heads shake together, in concert, from two such different springs.

bow, prevented all suspicion in my uncle toby, so he went on with what
he had to say to trim as follows:

--for my own part, trim, though i can see little or no difference
betwixt my nephew's being called tristram or trismegistus--yet as the
thing sits so near my brother's heart, trim--i would freely have given
a hundred pounds rather than it should have happened.--a hundred pounds,

christian-names, than what ignorant people imagine--for he says there
never was a great or heroic action performed since the world began by
one called tristram--nay, he will have it, trim, that a man can
neither be learned, or wise, or brave.--'tis all fancy, an' please your
honour--i fought just as well, replied the corporal, when the regiment
called me trim, as when they called me james butler.--and for my own
part, said my uncle toby, though i should blush to boast of myself,
trim--yet had my name been alexander, i could have done no more at namur
than my duty.--bless your honour! cried trim, advancing three steps as
he spoke, does a man think of his christian-name when he goes upon the
attack?--or when he stands in the trench, trim? cried my uncle toby,
looking firm.--or when he enters a breach? said trim, pushing in between
two chairs.--or forces the lines? cried my uncle, rising up, and pushing
his crutch like a pike.--o

my father was returned from his walk to the fish-pond--and opened the
parlour-door in the very height of the attack, just as my uncle toby was
marching up the glacis--trim recovered his arms--never was my uncle toby
caught in riding at such a desperate rate in his life! alas! my uncle
toby! had not a weightier matter called forth all the ready eloquence
of my father--how hadst thou then and thy poor hobby-horse too been
insulted!

my father hung up his hat with the same air he took it down; and after
giving a slight look at the disorder of the room, he took hold of one
of the chairs which had formed the corporal's breach, and placing
it over-against my uncle toby, he sat down in it, and as soon as

to struggle as i have done against this most uncomfortable of human
persuasions--i see it plainly, that either for my own sins, brother
toby, or the sins and follies of the shandy family, heaven has thought
fit to draw forth the heaviest of its artillery against me; and that the

of mind in your sister, with a due attention, brother toby, to her
evacuations and repletions--and the rest of her non-naturals, might not,
in a course of nine months gestation, have set all things to rights.--my
child was bereft of these!--what a teazing life did she lead herself,
and consequently her foetus too, with that nonsensical anxiety of hers
about lying-in in town? i thought my sister submitted with the greatest
patience, replied my uncle toby--i never heard her utter one fretful
word about it.--she fumed inwardly, cried my father; and that, let me
tell you, brother, was ten times worse for the child--and then! what
battles did she fight with me, and what perpetual storms about the
midwife.--there she gave vent, said my uncle toby.--vent! cried my
father, looking up.

--no doubt, sir,--there is a whole chapter wanting here--and a chasm of
ten pages made in the book by it--but the book-binder is neither a fool,
or a knave, or a puppy--nor is the book a jot more imperfect (at least
upon that score)--but, on the contrary, the book is more perfect and
complete by wanting the chapter, than having it, as i shall demonstrate

whether the same experiment might not be made as successfully upon
sundry other chapters--but there is no end, an' please your reverences,
in trying experiments upon chapters--we have had enough of it--so
there's an end of that matter.

but before i begin my demonstration, let me only tell you, that the
chapter which i have torn out, and which otherwise you would all have
been reading just now, instead of this--was the description of my
father's, my uncle toby's, trim's, and obadiah's setting out and
journeying to the visitation at....

had so fallen out that the coach-painter, whether by performing all his

--has the bend-sinister been brush'd out, i say? said my father.--there
has been nothing brush'd out, sir, answered obadiah, but the lining.
we'll go o'horseback, said my father, turning to yorick--of all things
in the world, except politicks, the clergy know the least of heraldry,
said yorick.--no matter for that, cried my father--i should be sorry
to appear with a blot in my escutcheon before them.--never mind the
bend-sinister, said my uncle toby, putting on his tye-wig.--no, indeed,
said my father--you may go with my aunt dinah to a visitation with a
bend-sinister, if you think fit--my poor uncle toby blush'd. my father
was vexed at himself.--no--my dear brother toby, said my father,
changing his tone--but the damp of the coach-lining about my loins, may
give me the sciatica again, as it did december, january, and february
last winter--so if you please you shall ride my wife's pad--and as
you are to preach, yorick, you had better make

our own rates.

now the chapter i was obliged to tear out, was the description of this
cavalcade, in which corporal trim and obadiah, upon two coach-horses
a-breast, led the way as slow as a patrole--whilst my uncle toby, in
his laced regimentals and tye-wig, kept his rank with my father, in deep
roads and dissertations alternately upon the advantage of learning and
arms, as each could get the start.

--but the painting of this journey, upon reviewing it, appears to be so
much above the stile and manner of any thing else i have been able
to paint in this book, that it could not have remained in it, without
depreciating every other scene; and destroying at the same time that
necessary equipoise and balance, (whe

the whole work results. for my own part, i am but just set up in the
business, so know little about it--but, in my opinion, to write a book
is for all the world like humming a song--be but in tune with yourself,
madam, 'tis no matter how high or how low you take it.

--this is the reason, may it please your reverences, that some of the
lowest and flattest compositions pass off very well--(as yorick told my
uncle toby one night) by siege.--my uncle toby looked brisk at the sound
of the word siege, but could make neither head or tail of it.

i humm'd over doctor homenas's notes--the modulation's very well--'twill

direct five words point-blank to the heart.--as yorick pronounced
the word point-blank, my uncle toby rose up to say something upon
projectiles--when a single word and no more uttered from the opposite
side of the table drew every one's ears towards it--a word of all others
in the dictionary the last in that place to be expected--a word i am
ashamed to write--yet must be written--must be read--illegal--

others who knew nothing of musical expression, and merely lent their
ears to the plain import of the word, imagined that phutatorius, who was
somewhat of a cholerick spirit, was just going to snatch the cudgels out
of didius's hands, in order to bemaul yorick to some purpose--and that
the desperate monosyllable z...ds was the exordium to an oration, which,
as they judged from the sample, presaged but a rough kind of handling of
him; so that my uncle toby's good-nature felt a pang for what yorick was
about to undergo. but seeing phutatorius stop short, without any attempt
or desire to go on--a third party began to suppose, that it was no more
than an involuntary respiration, casually forming itself into the shape
of a twelve-penny oath--without the sin or substance of one.

others, and especially one or two who sat next him, looked upon it on
the contrary as a real and substantial oath, propensly formed against
yorick, to whom he was known to be

you must be informed then, that gastripheres, who had taken a turn into
the kitchen a little before dinner, to see how things went on--observing
a wicker-basket of fine chesnuts standing upon the dresser, had ordered
that a hundred or two of them might be roasted and sent in, as soon
as dinner was over--gastripheres inforcing his orders about them, that
didius, but phutatorius especially, were particularly fond of 'em.

about two minutes before the time that my uncle toby interrupted
yorick's harangue--gastripheres's chesnuts were brought in--and as
phutatorius's fondness for 'em was uppermost in the waiter's head, he
laid them directly before phutatorius, wrapt up hot in a clean damask
napkin.

now whether it was physically impossible, with half a dozen hands all
thrust into the napkin at a time--but that some one chesnut, of more
life and rotundity than the rest, must be put in motion--it so fell
out, however, that one was actually sent rolling off the table;

--now, quoth didius, rising up, and laying his right hand with
his fingers spread upon his breast--had such a blunder about a
christian-name happened before the reformation--(it happened the day
before yesterday, quoth my uncle toby to himself)--and when baptism
was administer'd in latin--('twas all in english, said my uncle)--many
things might have coincided with it, and upon the authority of sundry
decreed cases, to have pronounced the baptism null, with a power of
giving the child a new name--had a priest, for instance, which was no
uncommon thing, through ignorance of the latin tongue, baptized a child
of tom-o'stiles, in nomine patriae & filia & spiritum sanctos--the
baptism was held null.--i beg your pardon, replied 
 
 ___________________________
 
he roots of the words continue untouch'd, the
inflections of their branches either this way or that, does not in any
sort hinder the baptism, inasmuch as the same sense continues in the
words as before.--but then, said didius, the intention of the priest's
pronouncing them grammatically must have been proved to have gone along
with it.--right, answered kysarcius; and of this, brother didius, we
have an instance in a decree of the decretals of pope leo the iiid.--but
my brother's child, cried my uncle toby, has nothing to do with the
pope--'tis the plain child of a protestant gentleman, christen'd
tristram against the wills and wishes both of his father and mother, and
all who are a-kin to it.--

if the wills and wishes, said kysarcius, interrupting my uncle toby, of
those only who stand related to mr. shandy's child, were to have weight
in this matter, mrs. shandy, of all people, has the least to do in
it.--my uncle toby lay'd down his pipe, and my father drew his chair
still closer to the table

'whether the mother be of kin to her
child,'--but, after much dispassionate enquiry and jactitation of the
arguments on all sides--it has been adjudged for the negative--namely,
'that the mother is not of kin to her child.' (vide brook abridg. tit.
administr. n. 47.) my father instantly clapp'd his hand upon my uncle
toby's mouth, under colour of whispering in his ear;--the truth was, he
was alarmed for lillabullero--and having a great desire to hear more of
so curious an argument--he begg'd my uncle toby, for heaven's sake, not
to disappoint him in it.--my uncle toby gave a nod--resumed his pipe,
and contenting himself with whistling lillabullero inwardly--kysarcius,
didius, and triptolemus went on with the discourse as follows:

this determination, continued kysarcius, how contrary soever it may seem
to run to the stream of vulgar ideas, yet had reason strongly on its
side; and has been put out of all manner of dispute from the famous
case, known commonly by the name of the duke of suffolk's c

the temporal lawyers--but the church lawyers--the juris-consulti--the
jurisprudentes--the civilians--the advocates--the commissaries--the
judges of the consistory and prerogative courts of canterbury and york,
with the master of the faculties, were all unanimously of opinion, that
the mother was not of (mater non numeratur inter consanguineos, bald. in
ult. c. de verb. signific.) kin to her child.--

and what said the duchess of suffolk to it? said my uncle toby.

the unexpectedness of my uncle toby's question, confounded kysarcius
more than the ablest advocate--he stopp'd a full minute, looking in
my uncle toby's face without replying--and in that single minute
triptolemus put by him, and took the lead as follows.

'tis a ground and principle in the law, said triptolemus, that things do
not ascend, but descend in it; and i make no doubt 'tis for this cause,
that however true it is, that the child may be of the blood and seed of
its parents--that the p

of--who not only thought of it, but justified his intention to his
father by the argument drawn from the law of retaliation.--'you
laid, sir, with my mother,' said the lad--'why may not i lay with
yours?'--'tis the argumentum commune, added yorick.--'tis as good,
replied eugenius, taking down his hat, as they deserve.

the company broke up.

--and pray, said my uncle toby, leaning upon yorick, as he and my father
were helping him leisurely down the stairs--don't be terrified, madam,
this stair-case conversation is not so long as the last--and pray,
yorick, said my uncle toby, which way is this said affair of tristram
at length settled by these learned men? very satisfactorily, replied
yorick; no mortal, sir, has any concern with it--for mrs. shandy the
mother is nothing at all a-kin to him--and as the mother's is the surest

uncle toby, have been some sort of consanguinity betwixt the duchess of
suffolk and her son.

tainly have been a mixture of ill-luck in it, that
the reasons on both sides should happen to be so equally balanced
by each other; for though my father weigh'd them in all humours
and conditions--spent many an anxious hour in the most profound and
abstracted meditation upon what was best to be done--reading books of
farming one day--books of travels another--laying aside all passion
whatever--viewing the arguments on both sides in all their lights and
circumstances--communing every day with my uncle toby--arguing
with yorick, and talking over the whole affair of the ox-moor with
obadiah--yet nothing in all that time appeared so strongly in behalf of
the one, which was not either strictly applicable to the other, or at
least so far counterbalanced by some consideration of equal weight, as
to keep the scales even.

excellent crop of wheat the year following--and the year after that,
to speak within bounds, a hundred--but in all likelihood, a hundred and

without end.--but then, to think he was all this while breeding up my
brother, like a hog to eat them--knocked all on the head again, and
generally left the old gentleman in such a state of suspense--that, as
he often declared to my uncle toby--he knew no more than his heels what
to do.

is to have a man's mind torn asunder by two projects of equal strength,
both obstinately pulling in a contrary direction at the same time:

him the family was out of yeast--and to ask whether he might not

of my brother's death, my father had got forwards again upon his
journey to within a stride of the compasses of the very same stage of

point of his compasses through nevers into the table--and nodding to
my uncle toby to see what was in the letter--twice of one night, is too

back from so lousy a town as nevers--what think'st thou, toby? added my
father in a sprightly tone.--unless it be a garrison town, said my uncle

as long as i live.--so giving a second nod--and keeping his compasses

a deep sigh from the bottom of his heart, he has been ill enough, poor

when agrippina was told of her son's death, tacitus informs us, that,
not being able to moderate the violence of her passions, she abruptly

own riding: he was sanguine in all his projects; so talked about his
pad every day with as absolute a security, as if it had been reared,

some neglect or other in obadiah, it so fell out, that my father's
expectations were answered with nothing better than a mule, and as ugly
a beast of the kind as ever was produced.

my mother and my uncle toby expected my father would be the death of
obadiah--and that there never would be an end of the disaster--see

done!--it was not me, said obadiah.--how do i know that? replied my

babylon, of cizicum and mitylenae? the fairest towns that ever the sun
rose upon, are now no more; the names only are left, and those (for many
of them are wrong spelt) are falling themselves by piece-meals to decay,
and in length of time will be forgotten, and involved with every thing
in a perpetual night: the world itself, brother toby, must--must come to
an end.

'returning out of asia, when i sailed from aegina towards megara,' (when
can this have been? thought my uncle toby,) 'i began to view the country
round about. aegina was behind me, megara was before, pyraeus on the
right hand, corinth on the left.--what flourishing towns now prostrate
upon the earth! alas! alas! said i to myself, that man should disturb
his soul for the loss of a child, when so much as this lies awfully
buried in his presence--remember, said i to myself again--remember thou
art a man.'--

now my uncle toby knew not that this last paragraph was an extract

trade, had been three or four different times in the levant, in one
of which he had stayed a whole year and an half at zant, my uncle toby
naturally concluded, that, in some one of these periods, he had taken a
trip across the archipelago into asia; and that all this sailing affair
with aegina behind, and megara before, and pyraeus on the right hand,
&c. &c. was nothing more than the true course of my father's voyage and
reflections.--'twas certainly in his manner, and many an undertaking
critic would have built two stories higher upon worse foundations.--and

finished the account--what year of our lord was this?--'twas no year
of our lord, replied my father.--that's impossible, cried my uncle
toby.--simpleton! said my father,--'twas forty years before christ was
born.

my uncle toby had but two things for it; either to suppose his brother
to be the wandering jew, or that his misfortunes had disordered his
brain.--'may the lord god of heaven and earth protect him and restore
him!' said my uncle toby, praying silently for my father, and with tears
in his eyes.

--my father placed the tears to a proper account, and went on with his
harangue with great spirit.

'there is not such great odds, brother toby, betwixt good and evil,
as the world imagines'--(this way of setting off,

 by the bye, was not
likely to cure my uncle toby's suspicions).--'labour, sorrow, grief,
sickness, want, and woe, are the sauces of life.'--much good may do
them--said my uncle toby to himself.--

'my son is dead!--so much the better;--'tis a shame in such a tempest to
have but one anchor.

'but he is gone for ever from us!--be it so. he is got from under the
hands of his barber before he was bald--he is but risen from a feast
before he was surfeited--from a banquet before he had got drunken.

quoth my uncle toby,)--'and feasted and made merry when a man went out

afresh?

there is no terrour, brother toby, in its looks, but what it borrows
from groans and convulsions--and the blowing of noses and the
wiping away of tears with the bottoms of curtains, in a dying man's
room.--strip it of these, what is it?--'tis better in battle than in
bed, said my uncle toby.--take away its hearses, its mutes, and its
mourning,--its plumes, scutcheons, and other mechanic aids--what
is it?--better in battle! continued my father, smiling, for he had
absolutely forgot my brother bobby--'tis terrible no way--for consider,
brother toby,--when we are--death is not;--and when death is--we are
not. my uncle toby laid down his pipe to consider the proposition; my
father's eloquence was too rapid to stay for any man--away it went,--and

for this reason, continued my father, 'tis worthy to recollect,
how little alteration, in great men, the approaches of death have
made.--vespasian died in a jest upon his close-stool--galba with a
sentence--septimus severus in a dispatch--tiberius in dissimulation, and
caesar augustus in a compliment.--i hope 'twas a sincere one--quoth my
uncle toby.

of this matter, continued my father,--this, like the gilded dome which

chapter 3.v.

my mother was going very gingerly in the dark along the passage which
led to the parlour, as my uncle toby pronounced the word wife.--'tis a
shrill penetrating sound of itself, and obadiah had helped it by leaving
the door a little a-jar, so that my mother heard enough of it to imagine
herself the subject of the conversation; so laying the edge of her
finger across her two lips--holding in her breath, and bending her head
a little downwards, with a twist of her neck--(not towards the door, but
from it, by which means her ear was brought to the chink)--she listened
with all her powers:--the listening

disputes,--and therefore (bating religious points, or such as touch

in the first passage, rather than be drawn into one--but i cannot

resolved from the beginning, that if ever the army of martyrs was to be
augmented,--or a new one raised,--i would have no hand in it, one way or
t'other.

--but to return to my mother.

my uncle toby's opinion, madam, 'that there could be no harm in
cornelius gallus, the roman praetor's lying with his wife;'--or rather
the last word of that opinion,--(for it was all my mother heard of it)
caught hold of her by the weak part of the whole sex:--you shall not
mistake me,--i mean her curiosity,--she instantly concluded herself the
subject of the conversation, and with that prepossession upon her fancy,
you will readily conceive every word my father said, was accommodated
either to herself, or h

--pray, madam, in what street does the lady live, who would not have
done the same?

from the strange mode of cornelius's death, my father had made a
transition to that of socrates, and was giving my uncle toby an abstract
of his pleading before his judges;--'twas irresistible:--not the oration
of socrates,--but my father's temptation to it.--he had wrote the life
of socrates (this book my father would never consent to publish; 'tis in
manuscript, with some other tracts of his, in the family, all, or most
of which will be printed in due time.) himself the year before he left
off trade, which, i fear, was the means of hastening him out of it;--so
that no one was able to set out with so full a sail, and

of his impatience,--of wondering why he was begot,--wishing himself
dead;--sometimes worse:--and when the provocation ran high, and grief
touched his lips with more than ordinary powers--sir, you scarce could
have distinguished him from socrates himself.--every word would breathe
the sentiments of a soul disdaining life, and careless about all its
issues; for which reason, though my mother was a woman of no deep
reading, yet the abstract of socrates's oration, which my father was
giving my uncle toby, was not altogether new to her.--she listened to
it with composed intelligence, and would have done so to the end of the
chapter, had not my father plunged (which he had no occasion to have
done) into that part of the pleading where the great philosopher
reckons up his connections, his alliances, and children; but renounces
a security to be so won by working upon the passions of his judges.--'i
have friends--i have relations,--i have three desolate children,'--says
socrates.--

--then, cried my

 mother, opening the door,--you have one more, mr.

of the room.



chapter 3.xiv.

--they are socrates's children, said my uncle toby. he has been dead a
hundred years ago, replied my mother.

my uncle toby was no chronologer--so not caring to advance one step but
upon safe ground, he laid down his pipe deliberately upon the table, and
rising up, and taking my mother most kindly by the hand, without saying
another word, either good or bad, to her, he led her out after my
father, that he might finish the ecclaircissement himself.

s own scattered thoughts,
counsels, and notions; and binding them together, so as to form an
institute for the government of my childhood and adolescence. i was
my father's last stake--he had lost my brother bobby entirely,--he had
lost, by his own computation, full three-fourths of me--that is, he had
been unfortunate in his three first great casts for me--my geniture,
nose, and name,--there was but this one left; and accordingly my father
gave himself up to it with as much devotion as ever my uncle toby had
done to his doctrine of projectils.--the difference between them was,
that my uncle toby drew his whole knowledge of projectils from nicholas
tartaglia--my father spun his, every thread of it, out of his own
brain,--or reeled and cross-twisted what all other spinners and
spinsters had spun before him, that 'twas pretty near the same torture
to him.

in about three years, or something more, my father had got advanced

i was five years old.--susannah did not consider that nothing was well

us;--nothing is left,--cried susannah,--nothing is left--for me, but to
run my country.--my uncle toby's house was a much kinder sanctuary; and
so susannah fled to it.

when susannah told the corporal the misadventure of the sash, with
all the circumstances which attended the murder of me,--(as she called
it,)--the blood forsook his cheeks,--all accessaries in murder being
principals,--trim's conscience told him he was as much to blame as
susannah,--and if the doctrine had been true, my uncle toby had as much
of the bloodshed to answer for to heaven, as either of 'em;--so tha

this to the reader's imagination:--to form any kind of hypothesis that

sore,--and to do it without,--he must have such brains as no reader ever
had before him.--why should i put them either to trial or to torture?
'tis my own affair: i'll explain it myself.



chapter 3.xix.

'tis a pity, trim, said my uncle toby, resting with his hand upon the
corporal's shoulder, as they both stood surveying their works,--that
we have not a couple of field-pieces to mount in the gorge of that new
redoubt;--'twould secure the lines all along there, and make the attack
on that side quite complete:--get me a couple cast, trim.

your honour shall have them, replied trim, before tomorrow morning.

it was the joy of trim's heart, nor was his fertile head ever at a loss
for expedients in doing it, to supply my uncle toby in

his campaigns,
with whatever his fancy called for; had it been his last crown, he would
have sate down and hammered it into a paderero, to have prevented a
single wish in his master. the corporal had already,--what with cutting
off the ends of my uncle toby's spouts--hacking and chiseling up
the sides of his leaden gutters,--melting down his pewter
shaving-bason,--and going at last, like lewis the fourteenth, on to
the top of the church, for spare ends, &c.--he had that very campaign
brought no less than eight new battering cannons, besides three
demi-culverins, into the field; my uncle toby's demand for two more
pieces for the redoubt, had set the corporal at work again; and no
better resource offering, he had taken the two leaden weights from th

nursery window: and as the sash pullies, when the lead was gone, were of
no kind of use, he had taken them away also, to make a couple of wheels
for one of their carriages.

he had dismantled every sash-window in my uncle toby's house long
before, in the very same way,--though not always in the same order; for
sometimes the pullies have been wanted, and not the lead,--so then he
began with the pullies,--and the pullies being picked out, then the lead
became useless,--and so the lead went to pot too.

--a great moral might be picked handsomely out of this, but i have not
time--'tis enough to say, wherever the demolition began, 'twas equally
fatal to the sash window.



chapter 3.xx.

the corporal had not taken his mea

tack, as she could;--true courage is not content with coming
off so.--the corporal, whether as general or comptroller of the
train,--'twas no matter,--had done that, without which, as he imagined,
the misfortune could never have happened,--at least in susannah's
hands;--how would your honours have behaved?--he determined at once,
not to take shelter behind susannah,--but to give it; and with this
resolution upon his mind, he marched upright into the parlour, to lay
the whole manoeuvre before my uncle toby.

my uncle toby had just then been giving yorick an account of the battle
of steenkirk, and of the strange conduct of count solmes in ordering the
foot to halt, and the horse to march where it could not act; which was
directly contrary to the king's commands, and proved the loss of the
day.

there are incidents in some families so pat to the purpose of what
is going to follow,--they are scarce exceeded by the invention of a
dramatic writer;--i mean of ancient days.--

tell his story so, that priests and virgins might have listened to
it;--and the story being told,--the dialogue went on as follows.



chapter 3.xxi.

--i would be picquetted to death, cried the corporal, as he concluded
susannah's story, before i would suffer the woman to come to any
harm,--'twas my fault, an' please your honour,--not her's.

the table,--if any thing can be said to be a fault, when the service
absolutely requires it should be done,--'tis i certainly who deserve the
blame,--you obeyed your orders.

fashion,--he

it not been for some regiments upon the right, who marched up boldly to
their relief, and received the enemy's fire in their faces, before any
one of their own platoons discharged a musket,--they'll go to heaven

yorick,--he's perfectly right. what signified his marching the horse,
continued the corporal, where the ground was so strait, that the french
had such a nation of hedges, and copses, and ditches, and fell'd trees

them for their lives.--there was nothing to be done for the horse:--he

fought us at landen.--possibly not,--trim, said my uncle toby;--though
if they have the advantage of a wood, or you give them a moment's time
to intrench themselves, they are a nation which will pop and pop for
ever at you.--there is no way but to march coolly up to them,--receive
their fire, and fall in upon them, pell-mell--ding dong, added
trim.--horse and foot, said my uncle toby.--helter skelter, said
trim.--right and left, cried my uncle toby.--blood an' ounds, shouted

terribly provoked at count solmes for disobeying his orders, that he
would not suffer him to come into his presence for many months after.--i
fear, answered yorick, the squire will be as much provoked at the
corporal, as the king at the count.--but 'twould be singularly hard
in this case, continued be, if corporal trim, who has behaved so
diametrically opposite to count solmes, should have the fate to be
rewarded with the same disgrace:--too oft in this wor

slight,--but a grateful bow towards his master,--and so the chapter
ends.

abreast,--and do you, corporal, follow a few paces behind us.--and
susannah, an' please your honour, said trim, shall be put in the
rear.--'twas an excellent disposition,--and in this order, without
either drums beating, or colours flying, they marched slowly from my
uncle toby's house to shandy-hall.

or fume one moment about the matter?

dear yorick, said my father smiling (for yorick had broke his rank with
my uncle toby in coming through the narrow entry, and so had stept first
into the parlour)--this tristram of ours, i find, comes very hardly by
all his religious rites.--never was the son of jew, christian, turk, or
infidel initiated into them in so oblique and slovenly a manner.--but he
is no worse, i trust, said yorick.--there has been certainly, continued
my father, the deuce and all to do in some part or other of the

he's the better for it.--provided, said yorick, you travel him into
egypt.--of that, answered my father, he will have the advantage, when he
sees the pyramids.--

now every word of this, quoth my uncle toby, is arabic to me.--i wish,
said yorick, 'twas so, to half the world.

cried my uncle toby.--though the learned, continued he, taking no notice
of my uncle toby's remark, but turning to yorick,--are greatly divided

opposite side of the question, have shewn the world the futility of the
greatest part of them.--but then again, our best polemic divines--i wish

will do the poor fellow more good than his supper,--i beg, brother,
you'll give him leave to come in.--with all my soul, said my

then putting the thumbs of both hands upon the crupper before him, and

i think it a little unfriendly in myself, in not having done it long
ago:--shall we have a short chapter or two now,--and a chapter or two
hereafter, as occasions serve; and so on, till we get through the whole?
my uncle toby and yorick made the obeisance which was proper; and the
corporal, though he was not included in the compliment, laid his hand
upon his breast, and made his bow at the same time.--the company smiled.
trim, quoth my father, has paid the full price for staying out
the entertainment.--he did not seem to relish the play, replied

to the table,--trim snuff'd the candle,--my father stirr'd up the

his head was worth.--but there is a better reason still, said my father
(dipping his pen into his ink); for the ox being the most patient of
animals, and the most useful withal in tilling the ground for their
nourishment,--was the properest instrument, and emblem too, for the new
joined couple, that the creation could have associated with them.--and
there is a stronger reason, added my uncle toby, than them all for the
ox.--my father had not power to take his pen out of his ink-horn, till
he had heard my uncle toby's reason.--for when the ground was tilled,
said my uncle toby, and made worth inclosing, then they began to secure
it by walls and ditches, which was the origin of fortification.--true,

ox in his place.

my father gave trim a nod, to snuff the candle, and resumed his

replied yorick, in the catechism.

--yorick could not forbear smiling.--your reverence does not consider,
said the corporal, shouldering his stick like a musket, and marching
into the middle of the room, to illustrate his position,--that 'tis
exactly the same thing, as doing one's exercise in the field.--

charitable uses (of which, by the bye, my father had no high opinion),
if the corporal has any one determinate idea annexed to any one word
he has repeated.--prithee, trim, quoth my father, turning round to
him,--what dost thou mean, by 'honouring thy father and mother?'

allowing them, an' please your honour, three halfpence a day out of my
pay, when they grow old.--and didst thou do that, trim? said yorick.--he
did indeed, replied my uncle toby.--then, trim, said yorick, springing
out of his chair, and taking the corporal by the hand, thou art the best
commentator upon that part of the decalogue; and i honour thee more for
it, corporal trim, than if thou hadst had a hand in the talmud itself.



chapter 3.xxxiii.

o blessed health! cried my father, making an exclamation, as he turned
over the leaves to the next chapter, thou art before all gold and
treasure; 'tis thou who enlargest the soul,--and openest all its powers

doubt: however, when the one decays, the
other decays also; and then is produced, either an unnatural heat, which
causes an unnatural dryness--or an unnatural moisture, which causes
dropsies.--so that if a child, as he grows up, can but be taught
to avoid running into fire or water, as either of 'em threaten his
destruction,--'twill be all that is needful to be done upon that head.--



chapter 3.xxxvii.

the description of the siege of jericho itself, could not have
engaged the attention of my uncle toby more powerfully than the last
chapter;--his eyes were fixed upon my father throughout it;--he never
mentioned radical heat and radical moisture, but my uncle toby took his
pipe out of his mouth, and shook his head; and as soon as the chapter
was finished, he beckoned to the corporal to come close to his chair,
to ask him the following question,--aside.--.... it was at the siege of
limerick, an' please your honour, replied the corporal, making a bow.

the poor fellow and i, quoth my uncle toby,

merick was raised, upon the very account you mention.--now
what can have got into that precious noddle of thine, my dear brother
toby? cried my father, mentally.--by heaven! continued he, communing
still with himself, it would puzzle an oedipus to bring it in point.--

i believe, an' please your honour, quoth the corporal, that if it had
not been for the quantity of brandy we set fire to every night, and the
claret and cinnamon with which i plyed your honour off;--and the geneva,
trim, added my uncle toby, which did us more good than all--i verily
believe, continued the corporal, we had both, an' please your honour,
left our lives in the trenches, and been buried in them too.--the
noblest grave, corporal! cried my uncle toby, his eyes sparkling as he
spoke, that a soldier could wish to lie down in.--but a pitiful death
for him! an' please your honour, replied the corporal.

all this was as much arabick to my father, as the rites of the colchi
and troglodites had been before to my uncle toby; my

father could not
determine whether he was to frown or to smile.

my uncle toby, turning to yorick, resumed the case at limerick, more
intelligibly than he had begun it,--and so settled the point for my
father at once.



chapter 3.xxxviii.

it was undoubtedly, said my uncle toby, a great happiness for myself
and the corporal, that we had all along a burning fever, attended with
a most raging thirst, during the whole five-and-twenty days the flux
was upon us in the camp; otherwise what my brother calls the radical
moisture, must, as i conceive it, inevitably have got the better.--my
father drew in his lungs top-full of air, and looking up, blew it forth
again, as slowly as he possibly could.--

--it was heaven's mercy to us, continued my uncle toby, which put it
into th

e corporal's head to maintain that due contention betwixt the
radical heat and the radical moisture, by reinforceing the fever, as he
did all along, with hot wine and spices; whereby the corporal kept up
(as it were) a continual firing, so that the radical heat stood its
ground from the beginning to the end, and was a fair match for the
moisture, terrible as it was.--upon my honour, added my uncle toby,
you might have heard the contention within our bodies, brother shandy,
twenty toises.--if there was no firing, said yorick.

well--said my father, with a full aspiration, and pausing a while after
the word--was i a judge, and the laws of the country which made me one
permitted it, i would condemn some of the worst malefactors, provided
they had had their clergy...--yorick, foreseeing the sentence was likely
to end with no sort of mercy, laid his hand upon my father's breast, and
begged he woul

d respite it for a few minutes, till he asked the corporal
a question.--prithee, trim, said yorick, without staying for my father's
leave,--tell us honestly--what is thy opinion concerning this self-same
radical heat and radical moisture?

with humble submission to his honour's better judgment, quoth the
corporal, making a bow to my uncle toby--speak thy opinion freely,
corporal, said my uncle toby.--the poor fellow is my servant,--not my
slave,--added my uncle toby, turning to my father.--

the corporal put his hat under his left arm, and with his stick hanging
upon the wrist of it, by a black thong split into a tassel about the
knot, he marched up to the ground where he had performed his catechism;
then touching his under-jaw with the thumb and fingers of his right hand
before he opened his mouth,--he delivered his notion thus.

well, my good doctor, cried my father sportively, for the transitions of
his passions were unaccountably sudden,--and what has this whelp of mine
to say to the matter?

had my father been asking after the amputation of the tail of a
puppy-dog--he could not have done it in a more careless air: the system
which dr. slop had laid down, to treat the accident by, no way allowed
of such a mode of enquiry.--he sat down.

pray, sir, quoth my uncle toby, in a manner which could not go
unanswered,--in what condition is the boy?--'twill end in a phimosis,
replied dr. slop.

i am no wiser than i was, quoth my uncle toby--returning his pipe
into his mouth.--then let the corporal go on, said my father, with his
medical lecture.--the corporal made a bow to his old friend, dr. slop,
and then delivered his opinion concerning radical heat and radical
moisture, in the following words.

and is, by its situation, one of the strongest fortified places in
ireland.--

i think this is a new fashion, quoth dr. slop, of beginning a medical
lecture.--'tis all true, answered trim.--then i wish the faculty would
follow the cut of it, said yorick.--'tis all cut through, an' please
your reverence, said the corporal, with drains and bogs; and besides,
there was such a quantity of rain fell during the siege, the whole
country was like a puddle,--'twas that, and nothing el

has done that with it--there is an end,--the mind and the idea are at

now the use of the auxiliaries is, at once to set the soul a-going
by herself upon the materials as they are brought her; and by the
versability of this great engine, round which they are twisted, to open
new tracts of enquiry, and make every idea engender millions.

you excite my curiosity greatly, said yorick.

for my own part, quoth my uncle toby, i have given it up.--the danes,
an' please your honour, quoth the corporal, who were on the left at the
siege of limerick, were all auxiliaries.--and very good ones, said my
uncle toby.--but the auxiliaries, trim, my brother is talking about,--i
conceive to be different things.--

--you do? said my father, rising up.

my father took a single turn across the room, then sat down, and
finished the chapter.

in which a child's memory should be exercised, there is no one idea can
enter his brain, how barren soever, but a magazine of conceptions and
conclusions may be drawn forth from it.--didst thou ever see a white
bear? cried my father, turning his head round to trim, who stood at
the back of his chair:--no, an' please your honour, replied the
corporal.--but thou couldst discourse about one, trim, said my father,
in case of need?--how is it possible, brother, quoth my uncle toby,
if the corporal never saw one?--'tis the fact i want, replied my
father,--and the possibility of it is as follows.

a white bear! very well. have i ever seen one? might i ever have seen
one? am i ever to see one? ought i ever to have seen one? or can i ever
see one?

would i had seen a white bear! (for how can i imagine it?)

of propositions;--and each proposition has its own consequences and
conclusions; every one of which leads the mind on again, into fresh
tracks of enquiries and doubtings.--the force of this engine, added my
father, is incredible in opening a child's head.--'tis enough, brother
shandy, cried my uncle toby, to burst it into a thousand splinters.--

i presume, said yorick, smiling,--it must be owing to this,--(for let
logicians say what they will, it is not to be accounted for sufficiently
from the bare use of the ten predicaments)--that the famous vincent
quirino, amongst the many other astonishing feats of his childhood, of
which the cardinal bembo has given the world so exact a story,--should
be able to paste up in the public schools at rome, so early as in the

fifty different theses, upon the most abstruse points of the most
abstruse theology;--and to defend and maintain them in such sort, as to
cramp and dumbfound his opponents.--what is that, cried my father, to
what is told us of alphonsus tostatus, who, almost in his nurse's arms,
learned all the sciences and liberal arts without being taught any one
of them?--what shall we say of the great piereskius?--that's the very
man, cried my uncle toby, i once told you of, brother shandy, who walked
a matter of five hundred miles, reckoning from paris to shevling, and
from shevling back again, merely to see stevinus's flying chariot.--he
was a very great man! added my uncle toby (meaning stevinus)--he was so,
brother toby, said my father (meaning piereskius)--and had multiplied
his ideas so fast, and increased his knowledge to such a prodigious
stock, that, if we may give credit to an anecdote concerning him, which
we cannot withhold here, wi

yorick:--but what are these, continued my father--(breaking out in a
kind of enthusiasm)--what are these, to those prodigies of childhood
in grotius, scioppius, heinsius, politian, pascal, joseph scaliger,
ferdinand de cordoue, and others--some of which left off their
substantial forms at nine years old, or sooner, and went on reasoning
without them;--others went through their classics at seven;--wrote

when the cataplasm was ready, a scruple of decorum had unseasonably rose
up in susannah's conscience, about holding the candle, whilst slop tied
it on; slop had not treated susannah's distemper with anodynes,--and so
a quarrel had ensued betwixt them.

face, as she declined the office;--then, i think i know you, madam--you

doctor slop and susannah filed cross-bills against each other in the
parlour; which done, as the cataplasm had failed, they retired into the
kitchen to prepare a fomentation for me;--and whilst that was doing, my
father determined the point as you will read.



chapter 3.xlviii.

you see 'tis high time, said my father, addressing himself equally to my
uncle toby and yorick, to take this young creature out of these women's
hands, and put him into those of a private governor. marcus antoninus
provided fourteen governors all at once to superintend his son
commodus's education,--and in six weeks he cashiered five of them;--i
know very well, continued my father, that commodus's mother was in love
with a gladiator at the time of her conception, which accounts for a
great many of commodus's cruelties when he became emperor;--but still i
am of opinion, that th

that is laziness;--or hang them down,--for that is folly; or hide them

nails, or hawk, or spit, or snift, or drum with his feet or fingers in
company;--nor (according to erasmus) shall he speak to any one in making
water,--nor shall he point to carrion or excrement.--now this is all
nonsense again, quoth my uncle toby to himself.--

i will have him, continued my father, cheerful, facete, jovial; at the
same time, prudent, attentive to business, vigilant, acute, argute,
inventive, quick in resolving doubts and speculative questions;--he
shall be wise, and judicious, and learned:--and why not humble, and
moderate, and gentle-tempered, and good? said yorick:--and why not,

off the chair, and laying down his pipe to take hold of my father's
other hand,--i humbly beg i may recommend poor le fever's son to you;--a
tear of joy of the first water sparkled in my uncle toby's eye, and
another, the fellow to it, in the corporal's, as the proposition was
made;--you will see why when you read le fever's story:--fool that i
was! nor can i recollect (nor perhaps you) without turning back to the
place, what it was that hindered me from letting the corporal tell it in
his own words;--but the occasion is lost,--i must tell it now in my own.

the story of le fever.

it was some time in the summer of that year in which dendermond was
taken by the allies,-

-which was about seven years before my father came
into the country,--and about as many, after the time, that my uncle toby
and trim had privately decamped from my father's house in town, in order
to lay some of the finest sieges to some of the finest fortified cities
in europe--when my uncle toby was one evening getting his supper, with
trim sitting behind him at a small sideboard,--i say, sitting--for in
consideration of the corporal's lame knee (which sometimes gave him
exquisite pain)--when my uncle toby dined or supped alone, he would
never suffer the corporal to stand; and the poor fellow's veneration for
his master was such, that, with a proper artillery, my uncle toby could
have taken dendermond itself, with less trouble than he was able to gain
this point over him; for many a ti

me when my uncle toby supposed the
corporal's leg was at rest, he would look back, and detect him standing
behind him with the most dutiful respect: this bred more little
squabbles betwixt them, than all other causes for five-and-twenty years
together--but this is neither here nor there--why do i mention it?--ask
my pen,--it governs me,--i govern not it.

he was one evening sitting thus at his supper, when the landlord of a
little inn in the village came into the parlour, with an empty phial in
his hand, to beg a gl

 thing--added the
landlord,--i would almost steal it for the poor gentleman, he is so
ill.--i hope in god he will still mend, continued he,--we are all of us
concerned for him.

thou art a good-natured soul, i will answer for thee, cried my uncle
toby; and thou shalt drink the poor gentleman's health in a glass of
sack thyself,--and take a couple of bottles with my service, and tell
him he is heartily welcome to them, and to a dozen more if they will do
him good.

though i am persuaded, said my uncle toby, as the landlord shut the
door, he is a very compassionate fellow--trim,--yet i cannot help
entertaining a high opinion of his guest too; there must be something
more than common in him, that in so short a time should win so much
upon the affections of his host;--and of his whole family, added the
corporal, for they are all concerned for him,.--step after him, said my
uncle toby,--do trim,--and ask if he knows his name.

--i have quite forgot it truly, said the landlord, coming back into the

rlour with the corporal,--but i can ask his son again:--has he a son
with him then? said my uncle toby.--a boy, replied the landlord, of
about eleven or twelve years of age;--but the poor creature has tasted
almost as little as his father; he does nothing but mourn and lament for
him night and day:--he has not stirred from the bed-side these two days.

my uncle toby laid down his knife and fork, and thrust his plate from
before him, as the landlord gave him the account; and trim, without
being ordered, took away, without saying one word, and in a few minutes
after brought him his pipe and tobacco.

--stay in the room a little, said my uncle toby.

trim!--said my uncle toby, after he lighted his pipe, and smoak'd about
a dozen whiffs.--trim came in front of his master, and made his bow;--my
uncle toby smoak'd on, and said no more.--corporal! said my uncle

but finished his pipe.

trim! said my uncle toby, i have a project in my head, as it is a bad
night, of wrapping myself up warm in my roquelaure, and paying a visit
to this poor gentleman.--your honour's roquelaure, replied the corporal,
has not once been had on, since the night before your honour received
your wound, when we mounted guard in the trenches before the gate of st.
nicholas;--and besides, it is so cold and rainy a night, that what with
the roquelaure, and what with the weather, 'twill be enough to give your
honour your death, and

 bring on your honour's torment in your groin. i
fear so, replied my uncle toby; but i am not at rest in my mind, trim,
since the account the landlord has given me.--i wish i had not known so
much of this affair,--added my uncle toby,--or that i had known more of
it:--how shall we manage it? leave it, an't please your honour, to me,
quoth the corporal;--i'll take my hat and stick and go to the house and
reconnoitre, and act accordingly; and i will bring your honour a full
account in an hour.--thou shalt go, trim, said my uncle toby, and here's
a shilling for thee to drink with his servant.--i shall get it all out
of him, said the corporal, shutting the door.

my uncle toby filled his second pipe; and had it not been, that h

full as well to have the curtain of the tennaile a straight line, as a

the story of le fever continued.

it was not till my uncle toby had knocked the ashes out of his third
pipe, that corporal trim returned from the inn, and gave him the
following account.

i despaired, at first, said the corporal, of being able to bring
back your honour any kind of intelligence concerning the poor sick
lieutenant--is he in the army, then? said my uncle toby--he is, said
the corporal--and in what regiment? said my uncle toby--i'll tell your
honour, replied the corporal, every thing straight forwards, as i learnt
it.--then, trim, i'll fill ano
 
 ___________________________
 
ther pipe, said my uncle toby, and not
interrupt thee till thou hast done; so sit down at thy ease, trim, in
the window-seat, and begin thy story again. the corporal made his old
bow, which generally spoke as plain as a bow could speak it--your honour
is good:--and having done that, he sat down, as he was ordered,--and
begun the story to my uncle toby over again in pretty near the same
words.

i despaired at first, said the corporal, of being able to bring back any
intelligence to your honour, about the lieutenant and his son; for when
i asked where his servant was, from whom i made myself sure of knowing
every thing which was proper to be asked,--that's a right distinction,
trim, said my uncle toby--i was answered, an' please your honour, that
he had no servant with him;--that he had come to the inn with hired
horses, which, upon finding hi

andlord spoke of;--but i
will do it for my father myself, said the youth.--pray let my save you
the trouble, young gentleman, said i, taking up a fork for the purpose,
and offering him my chair to sit down upon by the fire, whilst i did
it.--i believe, sir, said he, very modestly, i can please him best
myself.--i am sure, said i, his honour will not like the toast the worse
for being toasted by an old soldier.--the youth took hold of my hand,
and instantly burst into tears.--poor youth! said my uncle toby,--he
has been bred up from an infant in the army, and the name of a soldier,
trim, sounded in his ears like the name of a friend;--i wish i had him
here.

--i never, in the longest march, said the corporal, had so great a mind
to my dinner, as i had to cry with him for company:--what could be the
matter with me, an' please your honour? nothing in the world, trim,
said my uncle toby, blowing his nose,--but that thou art a good-natured
fellow.

when i gave him the toast, continued the corporal, i
 
 ___________________________
 
 thought it was
proper to tell him i was captain shandy's servant, and that your honour
(though a stranger) was extremely concerned for his father;--and that
if there was any thing in your house or cellar--(and thou might'st have
added my purse too, said my uncle toby),--he was heartily welcome to
it:--he made a very low bow (which was meant to your honour), but no
answer--for his heart was full--so he went up stairs with the toast;--i
warrant you, my dear, said i, as i opened the kitchen-door, your father
will be well again.--mr. yorick's curate was smoking a pipe by the
kitchen fire,--but said not a word good or bad to comfort the youth.--i
thought it wrong; added the corporal--i think so too, said my uncle
toby.

when the lieutenant had taken his glass of
 
 ___________________________
 
said your prayers at all.--i heard the poor gentleman say his
prayers last night, said the landlady, very devoutly, and with my own
ears, or i could not have believed it.--are you sure of it? replied the
curate.--a soldier, an' please your reverence, said i, prays as often
(of his own accord) as a parson;--and when he is fighting for his king,
and for his own life, and for his honour too, he has the most reason
to pray to god of any one in the whole world--'twas well said of thee,
trim, said my uncle toby.--but when a soldier, said i, an' please your
reverence, has been standing for twelve hours together in the trenches,
up to his knees in cold water,--or engaged, said i, for months
together in long and dangerous marches;--harassed, perhaps, in his rear
to-day;--harassing others to-morrow;--detached here;--countermanded
there;--resting this night out upon his arms;--beat up in his shirt the
next;--benumbed in his joints;--perhaps without straw in his tent to
kneel on;--must say his prayers how a
 
 ___________________________
 
nd when he can.--i believe, said
i,--for i was piqued, quoth the corporal, for the reputation of the
army,--i believe, an' please your reverence, said i, that when a soldier
gets time to pray,--he prays as heartily as a parson,--though not with
all his fuss and hypocrisy.--thou shouldst not have said that, trim,
said my uncle toby,--for god only knows who is a hypocrite, and who is
not:--at the great and general review of us all, corporal, at the day of
judgment (and not till then)--it will be seen who has done their
duties in this world,--and who has not; and we shall be advanced, trim,
accordingly.--i hope we shall, said trim.--it is in the scripture, said
my uncle toby; and i will shew it thee to-morrow:--in the mean time we
may depend upon it, trim, for our comfort, said my uncle toby, that god
almighty is so good an

but done our duties in it,--it will never be enquired into, whether
we have done them in a red coat or a black one:--i hope not, said the
corporal--but go on, trim, said my uncle toby, with thy story.

when i went up, continued the corporal, into the lieutenant's room,
which i did not do till the expiration of the ten minutes,--he was lying
in his bed with his head raised upon his hand, with his elbow upon the
pillow, and a clean white cambrick handkerchief beside it:--the youth
was just stooping down to take up the cushion, upon which i supposed he
had been kneeling,--the book was laid upon the bed,--and, as he rose, in
taking up the cushion with one hand, he reached out hi
 
 ___________________________
 
remember the story,
an't please your honour, said i, very well.--do you so? said he, wiping
his eyes with his handkerchief--then well may i.--in saying this, he
drew a little ring out of his bosom, which seemed tied with a black
ribband about his neck, and kiss'd it twice--here, billy, said he,--the
boy flew across the room to the bed-side,--and falling down upon his
knee, took the ring in his hand, and kissed it too,--then kissed his
father, and sat down upon the bed and wept.

i wish, said my uncle toby, with a deep sigh,--i wish, trim, i was
asleep.

your honour, replied the corporal, is too much concerned;--shall i pour
your honour out a glass of sack to your pipe?--do, trim, said my uncle
toby.

i remember, said my uncle toby, sighing again, the story of the ensign
and his wife, with a circumstance his modesty omitted;--and particularly
well that he, as well as she, upon some account or other (i forget what)
was universally pitied by the whole regiment;--but finish the story thou
art upon:-
 
 ___________________________
 
-'tis finished already, said the corporal,--for i could stay
no longer,--so wished his honour a good night; young le fever rose from
off the bed, and saw me to the bottom of the stairs; and as we went down
together, told me, they had come from ireland, and were on their route
to join the regiment in flanders.--but alas! said the corporal,--the
lieutenant's last day's march is over.--then what is to become of his
poor boy? cried my uncle toby.



chapter 3.li.

the story of le fever continued.

it was to my uncle toby's eternal honour,--though i tell it only for the
sake of those, who, when coop'd in betwixt a natural and a positive
law, know not, for their souls, which way in the world to turn
themselves--that notwithstanding my uncle toby was warmly engaged at
that time in carrying on the siege of dendermond, parallel with the
allies, who pressed theirs on so vigorously, that they scarce allowed
him time to get his dinner--that ne

rds the private distresses at the inn; and except
that he ordered the garden gate to be bolted up, by which he might be
said to have turned the siege of dendermond into a blockade,--he left
dendermond to itself--to be relieved or not by the french king, as the

relieve the poor lieutenant and his son.

--that kind being, who is a friend to the friendless, shall recompence
thee for this.

thou hast left this matter short, said my uncle toby to the corporal, as
he was putting him to bed,--and i will tell thee in what, trim.--in the
first place, when thou madest an offer of my services to le fever,--as
sickness and travelling are both expensive, and thou knowest he was but
a poor lieutenant, with a son to subsist as well as himself out of his
pay,--that thou didst not make an offer to him of my purse; because, had
he stood in need, thou knowest, trim, he had been as welcome to it as
myself.--your honour knows, said the corporal, i h

quoth my uncle toby,--thou didst very right, trim, as a soldier,--but
certainly very wrong as a man.

in the second place, for which, indeed, thou hast the same excuse,
continued my uncle toby,--when thou offeredst him whatever was in my
house,--thou shouldst have offered him my house too:--a sick brother
officer should have the best quarters, trim, and if we had him with
us,--we could tend and look to him:--thou art an excellent nurse
thyself, trim,--and what with thy care of him, and the old woman's and
his boy's, and mine together, we might recruit him again at once, and
set him upon his legs.--

--in a fortnight or three weeks, added my uncle toby, smiling,--he might
march.--he w

the corporal:--he will march; said my uncle toby, rising up from the
side of the bed, with one shoe off:--an' please your honour, said the
corporal, he will never march but to his grave:--he shall march, cried
my uncle toby, marching the foot which had a shoe on, though without
advanceing an inch,--he shall march to his regiment.--he cannot
stand it, said the corporal;--he shall be supported, said my uncle
toby;--he'll drop at last, said the corporal, and what will become
of his boy?--he shall not drop, said my uncle toby,
firmly.--a-well-o'day,--do what we can for him, said trim, maintaining
his point,--the poor soul will die:--he shall not die, by g.., cried my
uncle toby.

the story of le fever continued.

the sun looked bright the morning after, to every eye in the village but
le fever's and his afflicted son's; the hand of death pressed heavy upon
his eye-lids,--and hardly could the wheel at the cistern turn round its
circle,--when my uncle toby, who had rose up an hour bef

modes and customs, opened the curtain in the manner an old friend and
brother officer would have done it, and asked him how he did,--how
he had rested in the night,--what was his complaint,--where was his
pain,--and what he could do to help him:--and without giving him time
to answer any one of the enquiries, went on, and told him of the little
plan which he had been concerting with the corporal the night before for
him.--

--you shall go home directly, le fever, said my uncle toby, to my
house,--and we'll send for a doctor to see what's the matter,--and we'll
have an apothecary,--and the corporal shall be your nurse;--and i'll be
your servant, le fever.

there was a frankness in my uncle toby,--not the effect of
familiarity,--but the cause of it,--which let you at once into his soul,
and shewed you the goodness of his nature; to this there was something
in his looks, and voice, and manner, superadded, which eternally
beckoned to the unfortunate to come and take shelter u

before my uncle toby had half finished the kind offers he was making to
the father, had the son insensibly pressed up close to his knees, and
had taken hold of the breast of his coat, and was pulling it towards
him.--the blood and spirits of le fever, which were waxing cold and
slow within him, and were retreating to their last citadel, the
heart--rallied back,--the film forsook his eyes for a moment,--he
looked up wishfully in my uncle toby's face,--then cast a look upon his
boy,--and that ligament, fine as it was,--was never broken.--

le fever's, that is, from this turn of his fortune, to the time my uncle
toby recommended him for my preceptor, shall be told in a very few words

in the next chapter.--all that is necessary to be added to this chapter
is as follows.--

that my uncle toby, with young le fever in his hand, attended the poor
lieutenant, as chief mourners, to his grave.

that the governor of dendermond paid his obsequies all military
honours,--and that yorick, not to be behind-hand--paid him all
ecclesiastic--for he buried him in his chancel:--and it appears
likewise, he preached a funeral sermon over him--i say it appears,--for
it was yorick's custom, which i suppose a general one with those of
his profession, on the first leaf of every sermon which he composed,

allowed.--these, though hussar-like, they skirmish lightly and out of
all order, are still auxiliaries on the side of virtue;--tell me then,
mynheer vander blonederdondergewdenstronke, why they should not be

chapter 3.lv.

when my uncle toby had turned every thing into money, and settled all
accounts betwixt the agent of the regiment and le fever, and betwixt le
fever and all mankind,--there remained nothing more in my uncle toby's
hands, than an old regimental coat and a sword; so that my uncle toby
found little or no opposition from the world in taking administration.
the coat my uncle toby gave the corporal;--wear it, trim, said my
uncle toby, as long as it will hold together, for the sake of the poor
lieutenant--and this,--said
 
 ___________________________
 
 my uncle toby, taking up the sword in his
hand, and drawing it out of the scabbard as he spoke--and this, le
fever, i'll save for thee,--'tis all the fortune, continued my uncle
toby, hanging it up upon a crook, and pointing to it,--'tis all the
fortune, my dear le fever, which god has left thee; but if he has given
thee a heart to fight thy way with it in the world,--and thou doest it
like a man of honour,--'tis enough for us.

as soon as my uncle toby had laid a foundation, and taught him to
inscribe a regular polygon in a circle, he sent him to a public school,
where, excepting whitsontide and christmas, at which times the corporal
was punctually dispatched for him,--he remained to the spring of the
year, seventeen; when the stories of the emperor's sending his army into
hungary against the turks, kindling a spark of fire in his bosom, he
left his greek and latin without leave, and throwing himself upon his
knees before my uncle toby, begge

laid his hand upon his groin, and hung down his head in sorrow and
disconsolation.--

my uncle toby took down the sword from the crook, where it had hung
untouched ever since the lieutenant's death, and delivered it to
the corporal to brighten up;--and having detained le fever a single
fortnight to equip him, and contract for his passage to leghorn,--he
put the sword into his hand.--if thou art brave, le fever, said my
uncle toby, this will not fail thee,--but fortune, said he (musing a
little),--fortune may--and if she does,--added my uncle toby, embracing
him, come back again to me, le feve

the greatest injury could not have oppressed the heart of le fever more
than my uncle toby's paternal kindness;--he parted from my uncle toby,
as the best of sons from the best of fathers--both dropped tears--and as
my uncle toby gave him his last kiss, he slipped sixty guineas, tied up
in an old purse of his father's, in which was his mother's ring, into
his hand,--and bid god bless him.



chapter 3.lvi.

le fever got up to the imperial army just time enough to try what metal
his sword was made of, at the defeat of the turks before belgrade; but
a series of unmerited mischances had pursued him from that moment,
and trod close upon his heels for four years together after; he had
withstood these buffetings to the last,

till sickness overtook him at
marseilles, from whence he wrote my uncle toby word, he had lost his
time, his services, his health, and, in short, every thing but his

as this letter came to hand about six weeks before susannah's accident,
le fever was hourly expected; and was uppermost in my uncle toby's mind
all the time my father was giving him and yorick a description of what
kind of a person he would chuse for a preceptor to me: but as my uncle
toby thought my father at first somewhat fanciful in the accomplishments
he required, he forbore mentioning le fever's name,--till the character,
by yorick's inter-position, ending unexpectedly, in one, who should be
gentle-tempered, and generous, and good, it impressed the image of
le fever, and his interest, upon my uncle toby so forcibly, he ros

toby.--and the greatest cowards, an' please your honour, in our

contradicting it,--was to confirm it as strongly in the opinion of the
other half.--

chapter 3.lxiv.

if the reader has not a clear conception of the rood and the half of
ground which lay at the bottom of my uncle toby's kitchen-garden, and
which was the scene of so many of his delicious hours,--the fault is not
in me,--but in his imagination;--for i am sure i gave him so minute a
description, i was almost ashamed of it.

when fate was looking forwards one afternoon, into the great
transactions of future times,--and recollected for what purposes
this little plot, by a decree fast bound down in iron, had been
destined,--she gave a nod to nature,--'twas enough--nature threw half a
spade full of her kindliest co

mpost upon it, with just so much clay in
it, as to retain the forms of angles and indentings,--and so little of
it too, as not to cling to the spade, and render works of so much glory,
nasty in foul weather.

my uncle toby came down, as the reader has been informed, with plans
along with him, of almost every fortified town in italy and flanders;
so let the duke of marlborough, or the allies, have set down before what
town they pleased, my uncle toby was prepared for them.

his way, which was the simplest one in the world, was this; as soon as
ever a town was invested--(but sooner when the design was known) to take
the plan of it (let it be what town it would), and enlarge it upon a
scale to the exact size of his bowling-green; upon the surface of which,
by means of a large role of packthread, and a number of small piquets
driven into the ground, at the several angles and redans, he transferred
the lines from his paper; then taking the prof

ile of the place, with its
works, to determine the depths and slopes of the ditches,--the talus of
the glacis, and the precise height of the several banquets, parapets,
&c.--he set the corporal to work--and sweetly went it on:--the nature
of the soil,--the nature of the work itself,--and above all, the
good-nature of my uncle toby sitting by from morning to night, and
chatting kindly with the corporal upon past-done deeds,--left labour
little else but the ceremony of the name.

when the place was finished in this manner, and put into a proper
posture of defence,--it was invested,--and my uncle toby and the
corporal began to run their first parallel.--i beg i may not be
interrupted in my story, by being told, that the first parallel should
be at least three hundred toises distant from the main body of the
place,--and that

 i have not left a single inch for it;--for my uncle
toby took the liberty of incroaching upon his kitchen-garden, for the
sake of enlarging his works on the bowling-green, and for that reason
generally ran his first and second parallels betwixt two rows of his
cabbages and his cauliflowers; the conveniences and inconveniences of
which will be considered at large in the history of my uncle toby's
and the corporal's campaigns, of which, this i'm now writing is but a
sketch, and will be finished, if i conjecture right, in three pages (but
there is no guessing)--the campaigns themselves will take up as many
books; and therefore i apprehend it would be hanging too great a weight
of one kind of matter in so flimsy a performance as this, to rhapsodize
them, as i once intended, into the body of the work--surely they
had better be printed apart,--we'll consider the affair--so take the

chapter 3.lxv.

when the town, with its works, was finished, my uncle toby and the
corporal began to run their first parallel--not at random, or any
how--but from the same points and distances the allies had begun to run
theirs; and regulating their approaches and attacks, by the accounts
my uncle toby received from the daily papers,--they went on, during the
whole siege, step by step with the allies.

when the duke of marlborough made a lodgment,--my uncle toby made a
lodgment too.--and when the face of a bastion was battered down, or a
defence ruined,--the corporal took his mattock and did as much,--and
so on;--gaining ground, and making themselves masters of the works one
after another, till the town fell into their hands.

to one who took pleasure in the happy state of others,--there could not
have been a greater sight in world, than on a post morning, in which a
practicable breach had been made by the duke of marlborough, in the
main body of the p

observed the spirit with which my uncle toby, with trim behind him,
sallied forth;--the one with the gazette in his hand,--the other with a

in my uncle toby's looks as he marched up to the ramparts! what intense
pleasure swimming in his eye as he stood over the corporal, reading the
paragraph ten times over to him, as he was at work, lest, peradventure,
he should make the breach an inch too wide,--or leave it an inch too
narrow.--but when the chamade was beat, and the corporal helped my uncle
up it, and followed with the colours in his hand, to fix them upon the
ramparts--heaven! earth! sea!--but what avails apostrophes?--with

in this track of happiness for many years, without one interruption to
it, except now and then when the wind continued to blow due west for a
week or ten days together, which detained the flanders mail, and kept
them so long in torture,--but still 'twas the torture of the happy--in
this track, i say, did my uncle toby and trim move for many years, every
year of which, and sometimes every month, from the invention of either
the one or the other of them, adding some new conceit or quirk of
improvement to their operations, which always opened fresh springs of
delight in carrying them on.

the first year's campaign was carried on from beginning to end, in the
plain and simple method i've related.

in the second year, in which my uncle toby took liege and ruremond, he
thought he might afford the expence of four h

two of which i have given an exact description in the former part of my
work.

at the latter end of the same year he added a couple of gates with
port-cullises:--these last were converted afterwards into orgues, as
the better thing; and during the winter of the same year, my uncle toby,
instead of a new suit of clothes, which he always had at christmas,
treated himself with a handsome sentry-box, to stand at the corner of
the bowling-green, betwixt which point and the foot of the glacis,
there was left a little kind of an esplanade for him and the corporal to
confer and hold councils of war upon.

--the sentry-box was in case of rain.

all these were painted white three times over the ensuing spring, which
enabled my uncle toby to take the field with great splendour.

the war, but particularly that very year, had taken the field--but 'tis
not my brother toby's nature, kind soul! my father would add, to insult
any one.

--but let us go on.



chapter 3.lxvi.

i must observe, that although in the first year's campaign, the word
town is often mentioned,--yet there was no town at that time within the
polygon; that addition was not made till the summer following the spring
in which the bridges and sentry-box were painted, which was the third
year of my uncle toby's campaigns,--when upon his taking amberg, bonn,
and rhinberg, and huy and limbourg, one after another, a thought came
into the corporal's head, that to talk of taking so many towns, without
one town to shew for it,--was a very nonsensical way of going to work,
and so proposed to my uncle toby, that they should have a little model
of a town built for them,--to be run up together of slit deals, and then
painted, and clapped within the interior polygon to serve for all.

my uncle toby felt the go

y to be the representative:--with grated windows,
and the gable ends of the houses, facing the streets, &c. &c.--as those
in ghent and bruges, and the rest of the towns in brabant and flanders.

the other was, not to have the houses run up together, as the corporal
proposed, but to have every house independent, to hook on, or off, so
as to form into the plan of whatever town they pleased. this was put
directly into hand, and many and many a look of mutual congratulation
was exchanged between my uncle toby and the corporal, as the carpenter
did the work.

--it answered prodigiously the next summer--the town was a perfect
proteus--it was landen, and trerebach, and santvliet, and drusen, and
hagenau,--and then it was ostend and menin, and aeth and dendermond.

--surely never did any town act so many parts, since sodom and gomorrah,
as my uncle toby's town did.

in the fourth year, my uncle toby thinking a town looked foolishly
without a church, added a very fine one with a steeple.--trim was for
ha

ving bells in it;--my uncle toby said, the metal had better be cast
into cannon.

this led the way the next campaign for half a dozen brass field-pieces,
to be planted three and three on each side of my uncle toby's
sentry-box; and in a short time, these led the way for a train
of somewhat larger,--and so on--(as must always be the case in
hobby-horsical affairs) from pieces of half an inch bore, till it came
at last to my father's jack boots.

the next year, which was that in which lisle was besieged, and at the
close of which both ghent and bruges fell into our hands,--my uncle
toby was sadly put to it for proper ammunition;--i say proper
ammunition--because his great artillery would not bear powder; a

nd 'twas
well for the shandy family they would not--for so full were the papers,
from the beginning to the end of the siege, of the incessant firings
kept up by the besiegers,--and so heated was my uncle toby's imagination
with the accounts of them, that he had infallibly shot away all his
estate.

something therefore was wanting as a succedaneum, especially in one or
two of the more violent paroxysms of the siege, to keep up something
like a continual firing in the imagination,--and this something, the
corporal, whose principal strength lay in invention, supplied by an
entire new system of battering of his own,--without which, this had been
objected to by military critics, to the end of the world,

this will not be explained the worse, for setting off, as i generally
do, at a little distance from the subject.

the completion was no further off, than the very next morning; which was
that of the storm of the counterscarp betwixt the lower deule, to the
right, and the gate st. andrew,--and on the left, between st. magdalen's
and the river.

as this was the most memorable attack in the whole war,--the most
gallant and obstinate on both sides,--and i must add the most bloody
too, for it cost the allies themselves that morning above eleven hundred
men,--my uncle toby prepared himself for it with a more than ordinary
solemnity.

the eve which preceded, as my uncle toby went to bed, he ordered his
ramallie wig, which had laid inside out for many years in the corner of
an old campaigning trunk, which stood by his bedside, to be taken out
and laid upon the lid of it, ready for the morning;--and the very first
thing he did in his shirt, when he had stepped out of bed, my uncle
toby, after he had turned the rough side outwards,--put it on:--this
done, he proceede

sword half way in,--when he considered he should want shaving, and that
it would be very inconvenient doing it with his sword on,--so took it
off:--in essaying to put on his regimental coat and waistcoat, my uncle
toby found the same objection in his wig,--so that went off too:--so
that what with one thing and what with another, as always falls out when
a man is in the most haste,--'twas ten o'clock, which was half an hour
later than his usual time, before my uncle toby sallied out.



chapter 3.lxviii.

my uncle toby had scarce turned the corner of his yew hedge, which
separated his kitchen-garden from his bowling-green, when he perceived
the corporal had begun the attack without him.--

let me stop and give you a picture of the corporal's apparatus; and of
the corporal himself in the height of his attack, just as it struck my
uncle toby, as he turned towards the sentry-box, where the corporal
was at work,--for in nature there is not such another,--nor can an

chapter 3.lxix.

the corporal, who the night before had resolved in his mind to supply
the grand desideratum, of keeping up something like an incessant firing
upon the enemy during the heat of the attack,--had no further idea in
his fancy at that time, than a contrivance of smoking tobacco against
the town, out of one of my uncle toby's six field-pieces, which were
planted on each side of his sentry-box; the means of effecting which
occurring to his fancy at the same time, though he had pledged his cap,
he thought it in no danger from the miscarriage of his projects.

upon turning it this way, and that, a little in his mind, he soon began
to find out, that by means of his two turkish tobacco-pipes, with the
supplement of three smaller tubes of wash-leather at each of their
lower ends, to be tagg'd by the same number of tin-p

one good stroke, a good flint and steel could strike
into the tail of it.--think ye not that in striking these in,--he might,

--but this project, by the bye.

the corporal sat up the best part of the night, in bringing his to
perfection; and having made a sufficient proof of his cannon, with
charging them to the top with tobacco,--he went with contentment to bed.



chapter 3.lxx.

the corporal had slipped out about ten minutes before my uncle toby, in
order to fix his apparatus, and just give the enemy a shot or two before
my uncle toby came.

he had drawn the six field-pieces for this end, all close up together in
front of my uncle toby's sentry-box, leaving only an interval of about
a yard and a half betwixt the three, on the right and left, for the
convenience of charging, &c.--and the sake possibly of two batteries,
which he might think double the honour of one.

faced the counterscarp, where the attack was to be made that morning.
his first intention, as i said, was no more than giving the enemy a
single puff or two;--but the pleasure of the puffs, as well as the
puffing, had insensibly got hold of the corporal, and drawn him on from
puff to puff, into the very height of the attack, by the time my uncle
toby joined him.

'twas well for my father, that my uncle toby had not his will to make
that day.



chapter 3.lxxi.

my uncle toby took the ivory pipe out of the corporal's hand,--looked at
it for half a minute, and returned it.

in less than two minutes, my uncle toby took the pipe from the corporal
again, and raised it half way to his mouth--then hastily gave it back a
second time.

the corporal redoubled the attack,--my uncle toby smiled,--then looked
grave,--then smiled for a moment,--then looked serious for a long
time;--give me hold of the ivory pip

uncle toby put it to his lips,--drew it back directly,--gave a peep over
the horn-beam hedge;--never did my uncle toby's mouth water so much for
a pipe in his life.--my uncle toby retired into the sentry-box with the
pipe in his hand.--

--dear uncle toby! don't go into the sentry-box with the pipe,--there's
no trusting a man's self with such a thing in such a corner.



chapter 3.lxxii.

i beg the reader will assist me here, to wheel off my uncle toby's
ordnance behind the scenes,--to remove his sentry-box, and clear the
theatre, if possible, of horn-works and half moons, and get the rest
of his military apparatus out of the way;--that done, my dear friend
garrick, we'll snuff the candles bright,--sweep the stage with a new
broom,--draw up the curtain, and exhibit my uncle toby dressed in a new
character, throughout which the world can have no idea how he will act:

puzzlest us in every one.

there was, madam, in my uncle toby, a singleness of heart which misled
him so far out of the little serpentine tracks in which things of this
nature usually go on; you can--you can have no conception of it: with
this, there was a plainness and simplicity of thinking, with such
an unmistrusting ignorance of the plies and foldings of the heart of
woman;--and so naked and defenceless did he stand before you, (when a
siege was out of his head,) that you might have stood behind any one
of your serpentine walks, and shot my uncle toby

with all this, madam,--and what confounded every thing as much on the
other hand, my uncle toby had that unparalleled modesty of nature i
once told you of, and which, by the bye, stood eternal sentry upon
his feelings, that you might as soon--but where am i going? these
reflections crowd in upon me ten pages at least too soon, and take up
that time, which i ought to bestow upon facts.

and persicus, and prusicus, not one of whom (except cappadocius and
pontus, who were both a little suspected) ever once bowed down his
breast to the goddess--the truth is, they had all of them something else
to do--and so had my uncle toby--till fate--till fate i say, envying his
name the glory of being handed down to posterity with aldrovandus's and
the rest,--she basely patched up the peace of utrecht.

--believe me, sirs, 'twas the worst deed she did that year.



chapter 3.lxxiv.

amongst the many ill consequences of the treaty of utrecht, it was
within a point of giving my uncle toby a surfeit of sieges; and though
he recovered his appetite afterwards, yet calais itself left not a
deeper scar in mary's heart, than utrecht up

on my uncle toby's. to the
end of his life he never could hear utrecht mentioned upon any account
whatever,--or so much as read an article of news extracted out of the
utrecht gazette, without fetching a sigh, as if his heart would break in
twain.

my father, who was a great motive-monger, and consequently a very
dangerous person for a man to sit by, either laughing or crying,--for he
generally knew your motive for doing both, much better than you knew it
yourself--would always console my uncle toby upon these occasions, in a
way, which shewed plainly, he imagined my uncle toby grieved for nothing
in the whole affair, so much as the loss of his hobby-horse.--never
mind, brother toby, he would say,--by god's blessing we shall have
another war break out again some of these days; and when it does,--the
belligerent powers, if they would hang themselves, cannot keep us out of
play.--i defy 'em, my dear toby, he would add, to take countries without
taking towns,--or towns without sieges.

le toby never took this back-stroke of my father's at his
hobby-horse kindly.--he thought the stroke ungenerous; and the more
so, because in striking the horse he hit the rider too, and in the most
dishonourable part a blow could fall; so that upon these occasions,
he always laid down his pipe upon the table with more fire to defend
himself than common.

i told the reader, this time two years, that my uncle toby was not
eloquent; and in the very same page gave an instance to the contrary:--i
repeat the observation, and a fact which contradicts it again.--he
was not eloquent,--it was not easy to my uncle toby to make long
harangues,--and he hated florid ones; but there were occasions where the
stream overflowed the man, and ran so counter to its usual course,
that in some parts my uncle toby, for a time, was at least equal to
tertullus--but in others, in my own opinion, infinitely above him.

my father

was so highly pleased with one of these apologetical orations
of my uncle toby's, which he had delivered one evening before him and
yorick, that he wrote it down before he went to bed.

i have had the good fortune to meet with it amongst my father's papers,
with here and there an insertion of his own, betwixt two crooks, thus

wishing to continue the war.

my uncle toby's apologetical oration.

i am not insensible, brother shandy, that when a man whose profession
is arms, wishes, as i have done, for war,--it has an ill aspect to the
world;--and that, how just and right soever his motives the intentions
may be,--he stands in an uneasy posture in vindicating himself from
private views in doing it.

for this cause, if a soldier is a prudent man, which he may be without
being a jot the less brave, he will be sure not to utter his wish in
the hearing of an enemy; f

all which being considered, and that you see 'tis morally impracticable
for me to wind this round to where i set out--

i begin the chapter over again.



chapter 3.lxxvii.

i told the christian reader in the beginning of the chapter which
preceded my uncle toby's apologetical oration,--though in a different
trope from what i should make use of now, that the peace of utrecht was
within an ace of creating the same shyness betwixt my uncle toby and
his hobby-horse, as it did betwixt the queen and the rest of the
confederating powers.

there is an indignant way in which a man sometimes dismounts his horse,
which, as good as says to him, 'i'll go afoot, sir, all the days of my
life before i would ride a single mile upon your back again.' now my
uncle toby 
 
 ___________________________
 
could not be said to dismount his horse in this manner; for
in strictness of language, he could not be said to dismount his horse at
all--his horse rather flung him--and somewhat viciously, which made my
uncle toby take it ten times more unkindly. let this matter be settled
by state-jockies as they like.--it created, i say, a sort of shyness
betwixt my uncle toby and his hobby-horse.--he had no occasion for him
from the month of march to november, which was the summer after the
articles were signed, except it was now and then to take a short ride
out, just to see that the fortifications and harbour of dunkirk were
demolished, according to stipulation.

the french were so backwards all that summer in setting about that
affair, and monsieur tugghe, the deputy from the magistrates of dunkirk,
presented so many affecting petitions to the queen,--beseeching 
 
 ___________________________
 
her
majesty to cause only her thunderbolts to fall upon the martial works,
which might have incurred her displeasure,--but to spare--to spare the
mole, for the mole's sake; which, in its naked situation, could be no
more than an object of pity--and the queen (who was but a woman) being
of a pitiful disposition,--and her ministers also, they not wishing
in their hearts to have the town dismantled, for these private
reasons,...--...; so that the whole went heavily on with my uncle toby;
insomuch, that it was not within three full months, after he and the
corporal had constructed the town, and put it in a condition to be
destroyed, that the several commandants, commissaries, deputies,
negociators, and intendants, would permit him to set about it.--fatal
interval of inactivity!

the corporal was for beginning the demolition, by making a breach in the
ramparts, or main fortifications of the town--no,--that will never do,
corporal, said my uncle toby, for in going that way to wor

if the french are treacherous--they are as treacherous as devils, an'
please your honour, said the corporal--it gives me concern always when
i hear it, trim, said my uncle toby;--for they don't want personal
bravery; and if a breach is made in the ramparts, they may enter it, and
make themselves masters of the place when they please:--let them enter
it, said the corporal, lifting up his pioneer's spade in both his hands,
as if he was going to lay about him with it,--let them enter, an' please
your honour, if they dare.--in cases like this, corporal, said my
uncle toby, slipping his right hand down to the middle of his cane,
and holding it afterwards truncheon-wise wit

chapter 3.lxxviii.

a delusive, delicious consultation or two of this kind, betwixt my uncle
toby and trim, upon the demolition of dunkirk,--for a moment rallied
back the ideas of those pleasures, which were slipping from under
him:--still--still all went on heavily--the magic left the mind the
weaker--stillness, with silence at her back, entered the solitary
parlour, and drew their gauzy mantle over my uncle toby's head;--and
listlessness, with her lax fibre and undirected eye, sat quietly
down beside him in his arm-chair.--no longer amberg and rhinberg, and
limbourg, and huy, and bonn, in one year,--and the prospect of landen,
and trerebach, and drusen, and dendermond, the next,--hurried on the
blood:--no longer did saps, and mines, and blinds, and gabions, and
palisadoes, keep out this fair enemy of man's repose:--no more could my
uncle toby, after passing the french lines, as he eat his egg at supper

oyes, and
with all picardie open behind him, march up to the gates of paris, and
fall asleep with nothing but ideas of glory:--no more was he to dream,
he had fixed the royal standard upon the tower of the bastile, and awake
with it streaming in his head.

--softer visions,--gentler vibrations stole sweetly in upon his
slumbers;--the trumpet of war fell out of his hands,--he took up the
lute, sweet instrument! of all others the most delicate! the most
difficult!--how wilt thou touch it, my dear uncle toby?



chapter 3.lxxix.

now, because i have once or twice said, in my inconsiderate way of
talking, that i was confident the following memoirs of my uncle toby's
courtship of widow wadman, whenever i got time to write them, would
turn out one of the most complete systems, both of the elementary and
practical part of love and love-making, that ever was addressed to
the world--are you to imagine from thence, that i shall set out with
a description of what love is? whether part god and part devil, a

purslane--to which he added a pinch of snuff, of the herb hanea;--and
where aoetius durst venture it,--his topaz-ring.

--the other, that of gordonius, who (in his cap. 15. de amore) directs
they should be thrashed, 'ad putorem usque,'--till they stink again.

these are disquisitions which my father, who had laid in a great stock
of knowledge of this kind, will be very busy with in the progress of
my uncle toby's affairs: i must anticipate thus much, that from his
theories of love, (with which, by the way, he contrived to crucify my
uncle toby's mind, almost as much as his amours themselves,)--he took
a single step into practice;--and by means of a camphorated cerecloth,
which he found means to impose upon the taylor for buckram, whilst he
was making my uncle toby a new pair of breeches, he produced gordonius's
effect upon my uncle toby without the disgrace.

what changes this produced, will be read i

is needful to be added to the anecdote, is this--that whatever effect it
had upon my uncle toby,--it had a vile effect upon the house;--and if my

effect upon my father too.



chapter 3.lxxx.

--'twill come out of itself by and bye.--all i contend for is, that i am
not obliged to set out with a definition of what love is; and so long
as i can go on with my story intelligibly, with the help of the word

the rest of the world, why should i differ from it a moment before the
time?--when i can get on no further,--a

all sides of this mystic labyrinth,--my opinion will then come in, in

at present, i hope i shall be sufficiently understood, in telling the
reader, my uncle toby fell in love:

--not that the phrase is at all to my liking: for to say a man is fallen
in love,--or that he is deeply in love,--or up to the ears in love,--and
sometimes even over head and ears in it,--carries an idiomatical kind of
implication, that love is a thing below a man:--this is recurring again
to plato's opinion, which, with all his divinityship,--i hold to be
damnable and heretical:--and so much for that.

let love therefore be what it will,--my uncle toby fell into it.

chapter 3.lxxxiii.

i am now beginning to get fairly into my work; and by the help of a
vegetable diet, with a few of the cold seeds, i make no doubt but i
shall be able to go on with my uncle toby's story, and my own, in a
tolerable straight line. now,

(four very squiggly lines across the page signed inv.t.s and scw.t.s)

these were the four lines i moved in through my first, second, third,
and fourth volumes (alluding to the first edition.)--in the fifth volume
i have been very good,--the precise line i have described in it being
this:

(one very squiggly line across the page with loops marked
a,b,c,c,c,c,c,d)

by which it appears, that except at the curve, marked a. where i took

parentheses, and the common ins and outs incident to the lives of
the greatest ministers of state; and when compared with what men have
done,--or with my own transgressions at the letters abd--they vanish
into nothing.

in this last volume i have done better still--for from the end of le
fever's episode, to the beginning of my uncle toby's campaigns,--i have
scarce stepped a yard out of my way.

if i mend at this rate, it is not impossible--by the good leave of
his grace of benevento's devils--but i may arrive hereafter at the
excellency of going on even thus:

indeed most of the family, except my mother, who being taken up with
a project of knitting my father a pair of large worsted breeches--(the

she staid at home, at shandy hall, to keep things right during the
expedition; in which, i say, my father stopping us two days at auxerre,
and his researches being ever of such a nature, that they would have

of all colours, in such strange lights--and his remarks and reasonings
upon the characters, the manners, and customs of the countries we pass'd
over, were so opposite to those of all other mortal men, particularly
those of my uncle toby and trim--(to say nothing of myself)--and to
crown all--the occurrences and scrapes which we were perpetually meeting
and getting into, in consequence of his systems and opiniotry--they were
of so odd, so mix'd and tragi-comical a contexture--that the whole put
together, it appears of so different a shade and tint from any tour of
europe, which was ever executed--that i will venture to pronounce--the
fault must be mine and mine only--if it be not read by all travellers
and travel-readers, till

still.--

--but this rich bale is not to be open'd now; except a small thread or
two of it, merely to unravel the mystery of my father's stay at auxerre.

--as i have mentioned it--'tis too slight to be kept suspended; and when
'tis wove in, there is an end of it.

we'll go, brother toby, said my father, whilst dinner is coddling--to
the abbey of saint germain, if it be only to see these bodies, of which
monsieur sequier has given such a recommendation.--i'll go see any body,
quoth my uncle toby; for he was all compliance through every step of the
journey--defend me! said my father--they are all mummies--then one need
not shave; quoth my uncle toby--shave! no--cried my father--'twill be
more like relations to go with our beards on--so out we sallied, the
corporal lending his master his arm, and bringing up the rear, to the
abbey of saint germain.

every thing is very fine, and very rich, and very superb, and very
magnificent, said my father, addressing himself to the sacristan, who
was

 us into the tomb of st. heribald--this, said the sacristan, laying
his hand upon the tomb, was a renowned prince of the house of bavaria,
who under the successive reigns of charlemagne, louis le debonnair,
and charles the bald, bore a great sway in the government, and had a
principal hand in bringing every thing into order and discipline--

then he has been as great, said my uncle, in the field, as in the
cabinet--i dare say he has been a gallant soldier--he was a monk--said
the sacristan.

my uncle toby and trim sought comfort in each other's faces--but found
it not: my father clapped both his hands upon his cod-piece, which was a
way he had when any thing hugely tickled him: for though he hated a monk
and the very smell of a monk worse than all the devils in hell--yet the
shot hitting my uncle toby and trim so much harder than him, 'twas a
relative triumph; and put him into the gayest humour in the world.

it? said my uncle toby--what does any woman get by it? said my

to the ground, and uttering the word with so humble, but decisive a
cadence, it disarmed my father for a moment. 'tis supposed, continued
the benedictine, that st. maxima has lain in this tomb four hundred

her tomb: she was one of the fairest and most beautiful ladies either of
italy or france, continued the sacristan--but who the duce has got lain
down here, besides her? quoth my father, pointing with his cane to
a large tomb as we walked on--it is saint optat, sir, answered the
sacristan--and properly is saint optat plac'd! said my father: and
what is saint optat's story? continued he. saint optat, replied the
sacristan, was a bishop--

say, so disinterested was he in the search of truth, that had he
found a treasure in saint optat's tomb, it would not have made him half
so rich: 'twas as successful a short visit as ever was paid to the
dead; and so highly was his fancy pleas'd with all that had passed in
it,--that he determined at once to stay another day in auxerre.

we cross'd over the square--and while you are paying that visit, brother

higher--and nonsense--no, madam,--not there--i mean at the part i am now
pointing to with my forefinger--how can we help ourselves?

of all mortal, and immortal men too, if you please, who ever
soliloquized upon this mystic subject, my uncle toby was the worst
fitted, to have push'd his researches, thro' such a contention of
feelings; and he had infallibly let them all run on, as we do
worse matters, to see what they would turn out--had not bridget's
pre-notification of them to susannah, and susannah's repeated
manifestoes thereupon to all the world, made it necessary for my uncle
toby to look into the affair.

chapter 4.xxx.

i wish my uncle toby had been a water-drinker; for then the thing had
been accounted for, that the first moment widow wadman saw him, she felt
something stirring within her in his favour--something!--something.

--something perhaps more than friendship--less than love--something--no
matter what--no matter where--i would not give a single hair off my
mule's tail, and be obliged to pluck it off myself (indeed the villain
has not many to spare, and is not a little vicious into the bargain), to
be let by your worships

into the secret--

but the truth is, my uncle toby was not a water-drinker; he drank it
neither pure nor mix'd, or any how, or any where, except fortuitously
upon some advanced posts, where better liquor was not to be had--or
during the time he was under cure; when the surgeon telling him it would
extend the fibres, and bring them sooner into contact--my uncle toby
drank it for quietness sake.

now as all the world knows, that no effect in nature can be produced
without a cause, and as it is as well known, that my uncle toby was
neither a weaver--a gardener, or a gladiator--unless as a captain, you
will needs have him one--but then he was only a captain of foot--and
besides, the whole is an equivocation--there is nothing left for us to
suppose, but that my uncle toby's leg--but that will avail us little in
the present hypothesis, unless it had proceeded f

stiff and awkward, from a total disuse of it, for the three years he lay
confined at my father's house in town; but it was plump and muscular,
and in all other respects as good and promising a leg as the other.

other, you have got me thrust almost into the middle of it--

chapter 4.xxxii.

my uncle toby and the corporal had posted down with so much heat and
precipitation, to take possession of the spot of ground we have so often
spoke of, in order to open their campaign as early as the rest of the
allies; that they had forgot one of the most necessary articles of the
whole affair, it was neither a pioneer's spade, a pickax, or a shovel--

--it was a bed to lie on: so that as shandy-hall was at that time
unfurnished; and the little inn where poor le fever died, not yet built;
my uncle toby was 
 
 ___________________________
 
constrained to accept of a bed at mrs. wadman's, for
a night or two, till corporal trim (who to the character of an excellent
valet, groom, cook, sempster, surgeon, and engineer, super-added that of
an excellent upholsterer too), with the help of a carpenter and a couple
of taylors, constructed one in my uncle toby's house.

a daughter of eve, for such was widow wadman, and 'tis all the character
i intend to give of her--

--'that she was a perfect woman--' had better be fifty leagues off--or
in her warm bed--or playing with a case-knife--or any thing you
please--than make a man the object of her attention, when the house and
all the furniture is her own.

there is nothing in it out of doors and in broad day-light, where a
woman has a power, physically speaking, of viewing a man in more lights
than one--b

 when bridget untuck'd the feet of the
bed, &c. to do this--she consulted no thermometer but that of her
own passions; and so performed it standing--kneeling--or squatting,
according to the different degrees of faith, hope, and charity, she was
in, and bore towards her mistress that night. in every other respect,
the etiquette was sacred, and might have vied with the most mechanical
one of the most inflexible bed-chamber in christendom.

the first night, as soon as the corporal had conducted my uncle toby
up stairs, which was about ten--mrs. wadman threw herself into her
arm-chair, and crossing her left knee with her right, which formed a
resting-place for her elbow, she reclin'd her cheek upon the palm of her
hand, and leaning forwards, ruminated till midnight upon both sides of
the question.

the second night she went to her bureau, and having ordered bridget to
bring her up a couple of fresh candles and leave them upon the table,
she took out her marriage-settlement, and read it over with gre

stay) when bridget had pull'd down the night-shift, and was assaying to
stick in the corking pin--

--with a kick of both heels at once, but at the same time the
most natural kick that could be kick'd in her situation--for
supposing......... to be the sun in its meridian, it was a north-east
kick--she kick'd the pin out of her fingers--the etiquette which hung
upon it, down--down it fell to the ground, and was shiver'd into a
thousand atoms.

from all which it was plain that widow wadman was

my uncle toby's head at that time was full of other matters, so that it
was not till the demolition of dunkirk, when all the other civilities of
europe were settled, that he found leisure to return this.

this made an armistice (that is, speaking with regard to my uncle
toby--but with respect to mrs. wadman, a vacancy)--of almost eleven
years. but in all cases of this nature, as it is the second blow, happen
at what distance of time it will, which makes the fray--i chuse for
that reason to call these the amo

this is not a distinction without a difference.

it is not like the affair of an old hat cock'd--and a cock'd old
hat, about which your reverences have so often been at odds with one

and let me tell you, gentry, a wide one too.

now as widow wadman did love my uncle toby--and my uncle toby did not
love widow wadman, there was nothing for widow wadman to do, but to go
on and love my uncle toby--or let it alone.

widow wadman would do neither the one or the other.

the fates, who certainly all fore-knew of these amours of widow wadman
and my uncle toby, had, from the first creation of matter and motion
(and with more courtesy than they usually do things of this kind),
established such a chain of causes and effects hanging so fast to one
another, that it was scarce possible for my uncle toby to have dwelt in
any other house in the world, or to have occupied any other garden
in christendom, but the very house and garden which join'd and laid
parallel to mrs. wadman's; this, with the advantage of a thickset
arbour in mrs. wadman's garden, but planted in the hedge-row of my
uncle toby's, put all the occasions into her hands which love-militancy
wanted; she could observe my uncle toby's motions, and was mistress
likewise of his councils of war; and as his unsuspecting heart had given

sometimes out of gratitude, to make an attack, and endeavour to blow my
uncle toby up in the very sentry-box itself.

it is a great pity--but 'tis certain from every day's observation of
man, that he may be set on fire like a candle, at either end--provided
there is a sufficient wick standing out; if there is not--there's an
end of the affair; and if there is--by lighting it at the bottom, as
the flame in that case has the misfortune generally to put out
itself--there's an end of the affair again.

for my part, could i always have the ordering of it which

then i should burn down decently to the socket; that is, from my head to
my heart, from my heart to my liver, from my liver to my bowels, and
so on by the meseraick veins and arteries, through all the turns and
lateral insertions of the intestines and their tunicles to the blind
gut--

--i beseech you, doctor slop, quoth my uncle toby, interrupting him as
he mentioned the blind gut, in a discourse with my father the night my
mother was brought to bed of me--i beseech you, quoth my uncle toby, to
tell me which is the blind gut; for, old as i am, i vow i do not know to
this day where it lies.

the blind gut, answered doctor slop, lies betwixt the ilion and colon--

in a man? said my father.

that's more than i know; quoth my father.

now, through all the lumber rooms of military furniture, including both
of horse and foot, from the great arsenal of venice to the tower of
london (exclusive), if mrs. wadman had been rummaging for seven years
together, and with bridget to help her, she could not have found any one
blind or mantelet so fit for her purpose, as that which the expediency
of my uncle toby's affairs had fix'

d up ready to her hands.

i believe i have not told you--but i don't know--possibly i have--be it
as it will, 'tis one of the number of those many things, which a man
had better do over again, than dispute about it--that whatever town
or fortress the corporal was at work upon, during the course of
their campaign, my uncle toby always took care, on the inside of his
sentry-box, which was towards his left hand, to have a plan of the
place, fasten'd up with two or three pins at the top, but loose at
the bottom, for the conveniency of holding it up to the eye, &c...as
occasions required; so that when an attack was resolved upon, mrs.
wadman had nothing more to do, when she had got advanced to the door
of the sentry-box, but to extend her right hand; and edging in her left
foot at the same movement, to take hold of the ma

p or plan, or upright,
or whatever it was, and with out-stretched neck meeting it half way,--to
advance it towards her; on which my uncle toby's passions were sure to
catch fire--for he would instantly take hold of the other corner of the
map in his left hand, and with the end of his pipe in the other, begin
an explanation.

when the attack was advanced to this point;--the world will
naturally enter into the reasons of mrs. wadman's next stroke of
generalship--which was, to take my uncle toby's tobacco-pipe out of his
hand as soon as she possibly could; which, under one pretence or other,
but generally that of pointing more distinctly at some redoubt or
breastwork in the map, she would effect before my uncle toby (poor
soul!) had well march'd above half a dozen toises with it.

--it obliged my uncle toby to make use of his forefinger.

the difference it made in the attack was this; that in going upon it, as
in the first case, with the end of her fore-finger against the end of my
unc
 
 ___________________________
 
le toby's tobacco-pipe, she might have travelled with it, along the
lines, from dan to beersheba, had my uncle toby's lines reach'd so far,
without any effect: for as there was no arterial or vital heat in the
end of the tobacco-pipe, it could excite no sentiment--it could neither
give fire by pulsation--or receive it by sympathy--'twas nothing but
smoke.

whereas, in following my uncle toby's forefinger with hers, close thro'
all the little turns and indentings of his works--pressing sometimes
against the side of it--then treading upon its nail--then tripping it
up--then touching it here--then there, and so on--it set something at
least in motion.

this, tho' slight skirmishing, and at a distance from the main body, yet
drew on the rest; for here, the map usually falling with the back of it,
close to the side of the sentry-box, my uncle toby, in the simplicity
of his soul, would l

 mrs. wadman, by a manoeuvre as quick as thought,
would as certainly place her's close beside it; this at once opened a
communication, large enough for any sentiment to pass or re-pass, which
a person skill'd in the elementary and practical part of love-making,
has occasion for--

by bringing up her forefinger parallel (as before) to my uncle
toby's--it unavoidably brought the thumb into action--and the forefinger
and thumb being once engaged, as naturally brought in the whole hand.
thine, dear uncle toby! was never now in 'ts right place--mrs. wadman
had it ever to take up, or, with the gentlest pushings, protrusions,
and equivocal compressions, that a hand to be removed is capable of
receiving--to get it press'd a hair breadth of one side out of her way.

whilst this was doing, how could she forget to make him sensible, that
it was her leg (and no one's else) at the bottom of the sentry-box,
which slightly press'd against the calf of his--so that my uncle toby

these attacks of mrs. wadman, you will readily conceive to be of
different kinds; varying from each other, like the attacks which history
is full of, and from the same reasons. a general looker-on would scarce
allow them to be attacks at all--or if he did, would confound them all
together--but i write not to them: it will be time enough to be a little
more exact in my descriptions of them, as i come up to them, which will
not be for some chapters; having nothing more to add

the parlour, trim, for the stipulation--it lies upon the table.

it has lain there these six weeks, replied the corporal, till this very
morning that the old woman kindled the fire with it--

--then, said my uncle toby, there is no further occasion for our
services. the more, an' please your honour, the pity, said the corporal;
in uttering which he cast his spade into the wheel-barrow, which was
beside him, with an air the most expressive of disconsola

sorrowfully to his ear, forbad him.

--no; said the corporal to himself, i'll do it before his honour rises
to-morrow morning; so taking his spade out of the wheel-barrow again,
with a little earth in it, as if to level something at the foot of the
glacis--but with a real intent to approach nearer to his master, in
order to divert him--he loosen'd a sod or two--pared their edges with
his spade, and having given them a gentle blow or two with the back
of it, he sat himself down close by my uncle toby's feet and began as
follows.

demolition to the end--i have never once whistled, or sung, or laugh'd,
or cry'd, or talk'd of past done deeds, or told your honour one story
good or bad--

--thou hast many excellencies, trim, said my uncle toby, and i hold it

score: but prithee what is this story? thou hast excited my curiosity.

i'll tell it your honour, quoth the corporal, directly--provided,
said my uncle toby, looking earnestly towards dunkirk and the mole
again--provided it is not a merry one; to such, trim, a man should ever
bring one half of the entertainment along with him; and the disposition
i am in at present would wrong both thee, trim, and thy story--it is
not a merry one by any means, replied the corporal--nor would i have it
altogether a grave one, added my uncle toby--it is neither the one nor
the other, replied the corporal, but will suit your honour exactly--then
i'll thank thee for it

the corporal made his reverence; and though it is not so easy a matter
as the world imagines, to pull off a lank montero-cap with grace--or a
whit less difficult, in my conceptions, when a man is sitting squat upon
the ground, to make a bow so teeming with respect as the corporal was
wont; yet by suffering the palm of his right hand, which was towards his
master, to slip backwards upon the grass, a little beyond his body, in
order to allow it the greater sweep--and

 be said, rather to be insensibly squeez'd--than pull'd off with a
flatus--the corporal acquitted himself of both in a better manner than
the posture of his affairs promised; and having hemmed twice, to find in
what key his story would best go, and best suit his master's humour,--he
exchanged a single look of kindness with him, and set off thus.

there was a certain king of bo...he--as the corporal was entering the
confines of bohemia, my uncle toby obliged him to halt for a single
moment; he had set out bare-headed, having, since he pull'd off his
montero-cap in the latter end of the last chapter, left it lying beside
him on the ground.

--the eye of goodness espieth all things--so that before the corporal
had well got through the first five words of his story, had my
uncle toby twice touch'd his montero-cap with the end of his cane,
interrogatively--as much as to say, why don't you put it on, trim? trim

being dismally tarnish'd and fray'd moreover in some of the principal
leaves and boldest parts of the pattern, he lay'd it down again between
his two feet, in order to moralize upon the subject.

--'tis every word of it but too true, cried my uncle toby, that thou art
about to observe--

'nothing in this world, trim, is made to last for ever.'

--but when tokens, dear tom, of thy love and remembrance wear out, said
trim, what shall we say?

there is no occasion, trim, quoth my uncle toby, to say any thing else;
and was a man to puzzle his brains till doom's day, i believe, trim, it
would be impossible.

would be in vain for the wit of man to think of extracting a purer moral

seven castles.

throughout all the dynasties, olympiads, urbeconditas, and other

corporal was telling his story--had my uncle toby subjected this vast
empire of time and all its abysses at his feet; but as modesty scarce
touches with a finger what liberality offers her with both hands
open--the corporal contented himself with the very worst year of the
whole bunch; which, to prevent your honours of the majority and minority
from tearing the very flesh off your bones in contestation, 'whether
that year is not always the last cast-year of the last cast-almanack'--i

ronology, trim, said my uncle toby; for
as for geography, 'tis of absolute use to him; he must be acquainted
intimately with every country and its boundaries where his profession
carries him; he should know every town and city, and village and hamlet,
with the canals, the roads, and hollow ways which lead up to them; there
is not a river or a rivulet he passes, trim, but he should be able at
first sight to tell thee what is its name--in what mountains it
takes its rise--what is its course--how far it is navigable--where

nd who ploughs it; and be able to describe, or, if it is
required, to give thee an exact map of all the plains and defiles, the
forts, the acclivities, the woods and morasses, thro' and by which his
army is to march; he should know their produce, their plants, their
minerals, their waters, their animals, their seasons, their climates,
their heats and cold, their inhabitants, their customs, their language,
their policy, and even their religion.

is it else to be conceived, corporal, continued my uncle toby, rising
up in his sentry-box, as he began to warm in this part of his
discourse--how marlborough could have marched his army from the banks of
the maes to belburg; from belburg to kerpenord--(here the corporal
could sit no longer) from kerpenord, trim, to kalsaken; from kalsaken
to newdorf; from newdorf to landenbourg; from landenbourg to mildenheim;
from mildenheim to elchingen; from elchingen to gingen; from gingen to
balmerchoffen; from balmerchoffen to skellenburg, where he broke in

lech--push'd on his troops into the heart of the empire, marching at the
head of them through fribourg, hokenwert, and schonevelt, to the plains
of blenheim and hochstet?--great as he was, corporal, he could not have
advanced a step, or made one single day's march without the aids of
geography.--as for chronology, i own, trim, continued my uncle toby,
sitting down again coolly in his sentry-box, that of all others, it
seems a science which the soldier might best spare, was it not for the
lights which that science must one day give him, in determining the
invention of powder; the furious execution of which, renversing every
thing like thunder before it, has become a new aera to us of military
improvements, changing so totally the nature of attacks and defences
both by sea and land, and awakening so much art and skill in doing it,
that the wo

of its discovery, or too inquisitive in knowing what great man was the
discoverer, and what occasions gave birth to it.

i am far from controverting, continued my uncle toby, what historians
agree in, that in the year of our lord 1380, under the reign of
wencelaus, son of charles the fourth--a certain priest, whose name
was schwartz, shew'd the use of powder to the venetians, in their wars
against the genoese; but 'tis certain he was not the first; because if
we are to believe don pedro, the bishop of leon--how came priests and
bishops, an' please your honour, to trouble their heads so much about
gun-powder? god knows, said my uncle toby--his providence brings good

 the year 1343, which was full thirty-seven
years before that time, the secret of powder was well known, and
employed with success, both by moors and christians, not only in their
sea-combats, at that period, but in many of their most memorable sieges
in spain and barbary--and all the world knows, that friar bacon had
wrote expressly about it, and had generously given the world a receipt
to make it by, above a hundred and fifty years before even schwartz was
born--and that the chinese, added my uncle toby, embarrass us, and all
accounts of it, still more, by boasting of the invention some hundreds
of years even before him--

they are a pack of liars, i believe, cried trim--

--they are somehow or other deceived, said my uncle toby, in this
matter, as is plain to me from the present miserable state of military
architecture amongst them; which consists of nothing more than a fosse
with a brick wall without flanks--and for what they gave us as a bastion
at each angle of it, 'tis so barbarously cons

my uncle toby, tho' in the utmost distress for a comparison, most
courteously refused trim's offer--till trim telling him, he had half a
dozen more in bohemia, which he knew not how to get off his hands--my
uncle toby was so touch'd with the pleasantry of heart of the
corporal--that he discontinued his dissertation upon gun-powder--and
begged the corporal forthwith to go on with his story of the king of
bohemia and his seven castles.

the story of the king of bohemia and his seven castles, continued.

this unfortunate king of bohemia, said trim,--was he unfortunate, then?
cried my uncle toby, for he had been so wrapt up in his dissertation
upon gun-powder, and other military affairs, that tho' he had desired

not so strong upon his fancy as to account for the epithet--was he
unfortunate, then, trim? said my uncle toby, pathetically--the corporal,
wishing first the word and all its synonimas at the devil, forthwith
began to run back in his mind, the principal events in the king of
bohemia's story; from every one of which, it appearing that he was the
most fortunate man that ever existed in the world--it put the corporal
to a stand: for not caring to retract his epithet--and less to explain
it--and least of all, to twist his tale (like men of lore) to serve a
system--he looked up in my uncle toby's face for as

sistance--but seeing
it was the very thing my uncle toby sat in expectation of himself--after
a hum and a haw, he went on--

the king of bohemia, an' please your honour, replied the corporal,
was unfortunate, as thus--that taking great pleasure and delight in
navigation and all sort of sea affairs--and there happening throughout
the whole kingdom of bohemia, to be no sea-port town whatever--

how the duce should there--trim? cried my uncle toby; for bohemia being
totally inland, it could have happen'd no otherwise--it might, said
trim, if it had pleased god--

my uncle toby never spoke of the being and natural attributes of god,
but with diffidence and hesitation--

--i believe not, replied my uncle toby, after some pause--for being
inland, as i said, and having silesia and moravia to the east; lusatia
and upper saxony to the north; franconia to the west; and bavaria to the
south; bohemia could not have been propell'd to the sea witho

bohemia, without overflowing a great part of germany, and destroying
millions of unfortunate inhabitants who could make no defence against
it--scandalous! cried trim--which would bespeak, added my uncle toby,
mildly, such a want of compassion in him who is the father of it--that,
i think, trim--the thing could have happen'd no way.

the corporal made the bow of unfeign'd conviction; and went on.

now the king of bohemia with his queen and courtiers happening one fine
summer's evening to walk out--aye! there the word happening is right,
trim, cried my uncle toby; for the king of bohemia and his queen might
have walk'd out or let it alone:--'twas a matter of contingency, which
might happen, or not, j

king william was of an opinion, an' please your honour, quoth trim,
that every thing was predestined for us in this world; insomuch, that
he would often say to his soldiers, that 'every ball had its billet.' he
was a great man, said my uncle toby--and i believe, continued trim, to
this day, that the shot which disabled me at the battle of landen,
was pointed at my knee for no other purpose, but to take me out of his
service, and place me in your honour's, where i should be taken so
much better care of in my old age--it shall never, trim, be construed
otherwise, said my uncle toby.

the heart, both of the master and the man, were alike subject to sudden
over-flowings;--a short silence ensued.

besides, said the corporal, resuming the dis

course--but in a gayer
accent--if it had not been for that single shot, i had never, 'an please
your honour, been in love--

so, thou wast once in love, trim! said my uncle toby, smiling--

souse! replied the corporal--over head and ears! an' please your honour.
prithee when? where?--and how came it to pass?--i never heard one word
of it before; quoth my uncle toby:--i dare say, answered trim, that
every drummer and serjeant's son in the regiment knew of it--it's high
time i should--said my uncle toby.

your honour remembers with concern, said the corporal, the total rout
and confusion of our camp and army at the affair of landen; every one
was left to shift for himself; and if it had not been for the regiments
of wyndham, lumley, and galway, which covered the retreat over the
bridge neerspeeken, the king himself could scarce have gained it--he was
press'd hard, as your honour knows, on every side of him--

gallant mortal! cried my uncle toby, caught up with enthusiasm--this
moment, now that

 all is lost, i see him galloping across me, corporal,
to the left, to bring up the remains of the english horse along with him
to support the right, and tear the laurel from luxembourg's brows, if
yet 'tis possible--i see him with the knot of his scarfe just shot off,
infusing fresh spirits into poor galway's regiment--riding along the
line--then wheeling about, and charging conti at the head of it--brave,
brave, by heaven! cried my uncle toby--he deserves a crown--as richly,
as a thief a halter; shouted trim.

my uncle toby knew the corporal's loyalty;--otherwise the comparison
was not at all to his mind--it did not altogether strike the corporal's
fancy when he had made it--but it could not be recall'd--so he had
nothing to do, but proceed.

as the number of wounded was prodigious, and no one had time to think
of any thing but his own safety--though talmash, said my uncle toby,
brought off the foot with great prudence--but i was le

said the corporal. thou wast so; poor fellow! replied my uncle toby--so
that it was noon the next day, continued the corporal, before i was
exchanged, and put into a cart with thirteen or fourteen more, in order
to be convey'd to our hospital.

there is no part of the body, an' please your honour, where a wound
occasions more intolerable anguish than upon the knee--

except the groin; said my uncle toby. an' please your honour, replied
the corporal, the knee, in my opinion, must certainly be the most acute,
there being so many tendons and what-d'ye-call-'ems all about it.

it is for that reason, quoth my uncle toby, that the groin is
infinitely more sensible--there being not only as many tendons
and what-d'ye-call-'ems (for i know their names as little as thou
dost)--about it--but moreover ...--

the dispute was maintained with amicable and equal force betwixt my
uncle toby and trim for some time; till trim at length recollecting that
he had often cried at his master's sufferings, but never shed a tear
at his own--was for giving up the point, which my uncle toby would not
allow--'tis a proof of nothing, trim, said he, but the generosity of thy
temper--

so that whether the pain of a wound in the groin (caeteris paribus) is
greater than the pain of a wound in the knee--or

whether the pain of a wound in the knee is not greater than the pain of
a wound in the groin--are points which to this day remain unsettled.



chapter 4.xliv.

the anguish of my knee, continued the corporal, was excessive in itself;
and the uneasiness of the cart, with the roughness

e, she had given
it me a second and a third time--so i was telling her, an' please your
honour, the anguish i was in, and was saying it was so intolerable
to me, that i had much rather lie down upon the bed, turning my face
towards one which was in the corner of the room--and die, than go
on--when, upon her attempting to lead me to it, i fainted away in her
arms. she was a good soul! as your honour, said the corporal, wiping his
eyes, will hear.

i thought love had been a joyous thing, quoth my uncle toby.

'tis the most serious thing, an' please your honour (sometimes), that is
in the world.

by the persuasion of the young woman, continued the corporal, the cart
with the wounded men set off without me: she had assured them i should
expire immediately if i was put into the cart. so when i came to
myself--i found myself in a still quiet cottage, with no one but the
young woman, and the peasant and his wife. i was laid across the bed in
the corner of the room, with my wounded leg upon a chair, and

, i'll be
your nurse too.

i thought by her manner of speaking this, as well as by her dress, which
i then began to consider more attentively--that the young woman could
not be the daughter of the peasant.

she was in black down to her toes, with her hair conceal'd under a
cambric border, laid close to her forehead: she was one of those kind of
nuns, an' please your honour, of which, your honour knows, there are
a good many in flanders, which they let go loose--by thy description,
trim, said my uncle toby, i dare say she was a young beguine, of
which there are none to be found any where but in the spanish
netherlands--except at amsterdam--they differ from nuns in this, that
they can quit their cloister if they choose to marry; they visit and
take care of the sick by profession--i had rather, for my own part, they
did it out of good-nature.

did not like it.--i believe, trim, we are both wrong, said my uncle
toby--we'll ask mr.

the young beguine, continued the corporal, had scarce given herself time
to tell me 'she would be my nurse,' when she hastily turned about to
begin the office of one, and prepare something for me--and in a short
time--though i thought it a long one--she came back with flannels, &c.
&c. and having fomented my knee soundly for a couple of hours, &c. and
made me a thin bason of gruel for my supper--she wish'd me rest, and

ng them in reality. in truth, she was scarce
ever from me; and so accustomed was i to receive life from her hands,
that my heart sickened, and i lost colour when she left the room: and
yet, continued the corporal (making one of the strangest reflections
upon it in the world)----'it was not love'--for during the three weeks
she was almost constantly with me, fomenting my knee with her hand,
night and day--i can honestly say, an' please your honour--that...once.

that was very odd, trim, quoth my uncle toby.

i think so too--said mrs. wadman.

it never did, said the corporal.



chapter 4.xlv.

--but 'tis no marvel, continued the corporal--seeing my uncle toby
musing upon it--for love, an' please your honour, is exactly like war,
in this; that a soldier, though he has escaped three weeks complete
o'saturday night,--may nevertheless be shot through his heart on
sunday morning--it happened so here, an' please your honour, with this
difference only--that it was on sunday in the afternoon, when i fell

honour, like a bomb--scarce giving me time to say, 'god bless me.'

i thought, trim, said my uncle toby, a man never fell in love so very
suddenly.

yes, an' please your honour, if he is in the way of it--replied trim.

i prithee, quoth my uncle toby, inform me how this matter happened.

--with all pleasure, said the corporal, making a bow.



chapter 4.xlvi.

i had escaped, continued the corporal, all that time from falling
in love, and had gone on to the end of the chapter, had it not been
predestined otherwise--there is no resisting our fate.

it was on a sunday, in the afternoon, as i told your honour.

the old man and his wife had walked out--

every thing was still and hush as midnight about the house--

there was not so much as a duc

 her fore-finger backwards and forwards by the edge of the
flannel which kept on the dressing.

in five or six minutes i felt slightly the end of her second finger--and
presently it was laid flat with the other, and she continued rubbing in
that way round and round for a good while; it then came into my head,
that i should fall in love--i blush'd when i saw how white a hand she
had--i shall never, an' please your honour, behold another hand so white
whilst i live--

--not in that place, said my uncle toby--

though it was the most serious despair in nature to the corporal--he
could not forbear smiling.

the young beguine, continued the corporal, perceiving it was of great
service to me--from rubbing for some time, with two fingers--proceeded
to rub at length, with three--till by little and little she brought
down the fourth, and then rubb'd with her whole hand: i will never
say another word, an' please your honour, upon hands again--but it was
softer than sattin--

--prithee, trim, commend it as

 much as thou wilt, said my uncle toby;
i shall hear thy story with the more delight--the corporal thank'd his
master most unfeignedly; but having nothing to say upon the beguine's
hand but the same over again--he proceeded to the effects of it.

the fair beguine, said the corporal, continued rubbing with her whole
hand under my knee--till i fear'd her zeal would weary her--'i would do
a thousand times more,' said she, 'for the love of christ'--in saying
which, she pass'd her hand across the flannel, to the part above my
knee, which
 
 ___________________________
 
 i had equally complain'd of, and rubb'd it also.

i perceiv'd, then, i was beginning to be in love--

as she continued rub-rub-rubbing--i felt it spread from under her hand,
an' please your honour, to every part of my frame--

the more she rubb'd, and the longer strokes she took--the more the fire
kindled in my veins--till at length, by two or three strokes longer than
the rest--my passion rose to the highest pitch--i seiz'd her hand--

--and then thou clapped'st it to thy lips, trim, said my uncle toby--and
madest a speech.

whether the corporal's amour terminated precisely in the way my uncle
toby described it, is not material; it is enough that it contained in
it the essence of all the love romances which ever have been wrote since
the beginning of the world.



chapter 4.xlvii.

as soon as the corporal had finished the story of his amour--or rather
my uncle toby for him--mrs. wadman silently sallied forth from her
arbour, replaced the pin in her mob, pass'd the wicker gate, and
advanced sl

owly towards my uncle toby's sentry-box: the disposition
which trim had made in my uncle toby's mind, was too favourable a crisis
to be let slipp'd--

--the attack was determin'd upon: it was facilitated still more by my
uncle toby's having ordered the corporal to wheel off the pioneer's
shovel, the spade, the pick-axe, the picquets, and other military stores
which lay scatter'd upon the ground where dunkirk stood--the corporal
had march'd--the field was clear.

now, consider, sir, what nonsense it is, either in fighting, or writing,
or any thing else (whether in rhyme to it, or not) which a man has
occasion to do--to act by plan: for if ever plan, independent of all
circumstances, deserved registering in letters of gold

of my uncle toby in his sentry-box, by plan--now the plan hanging up in
it at this juncture, being the plan of dunkirk--and the tale of dunkirk
a tale of relaxation, it opposed every impression she could make: and
besides, could she have gone upon it--the manoeuvre of fingers and hands
in the attack of the sentry-box, was so outdone by that of the fair
beguine's, in trim's story--that just then, that particular attack,
however successful before--became the most heartless attack that could
be made--

--i am half distracted, captain shandy, said mrs. wadman, holding up her
cambrick handkerchief to her left eye, as she approach'd the door of my
uncle toby's sentry-box--a mote--or sand--or something--i know not what,
has got into this eye of mine--do look into it--it is not in the white--

in saying which, mrs. wadman edged herself close in beside my uncle
toby, and squeezing herself down upon the corner of his bench, she gave
him an opportunity of doing it without rising up--do look into it--said
she.

as ever child look'd into a raree-shew-box; and 'twere as much a sin to

--if a man will be peeping of his own accord into things of that
nature--i've nothing to say to it--

my uncle toby never did: and i will answer for him, that he would have
sat quietly upon a sofa from june to january (which, you know, takes
in both the hot and cold months), with an eye as fine as the thracian
rodope's (rodope thracia tam inevitabili fascino instructa, tam exacte
oculus intuens attraxit, ut si in illam quis incidisset, fieri non
posset, quin caperetur.--i know not who.) besides him, without being
able to tell, whether it was a black or blue one.

the difficulty was to get my uncle toby, to l

left eye shines this moment as lucid as her right--there is neither
mote, or sand, or dust, or chaff, or speck, or particle of opake matter
floating in it--there is nothing, my dear paternal uncle! but one
lambent delicious fire, furtively shooting out from every part of it, in
all directions, into thine--

--if thou lookest, uncle toby, in search of this mote one moment
longer,--thou art undone.

an eye is for all the world exactly like a cannon, in this respect; that
it is not so much the eye or the cannon, in themselves, as it is the
carriage of the eye--and the carriage of the cannon, by which both the
one and the other are enabled to do so much execution. i don't think the
comparison a bad one: however, as 'tis made and placed at the head of

might and main into the pupil--

those of venus herself, which certainly were as venereal a pair of eyes
as ever stood in a head--there never was an eye of them all, so fitted
to rob my uncle toby of his repose, as the very eye, at which he was
looking--it was not, madam a rolling eye--a romping or a wanton one--nor
was it an eye sparkling--petulant or imperious--of high claims and
terrifying exactions, which w

holds coarse converse--but whispering soft--like the last low accent of

chapter 4.l.

there is nothing shews the character of my father and my uncle toby, in
a more entertaining light, than their different manner of deportment,
under the same accident--for i call not love a misfortune, from a
persuasion, that a man's heart is ever the better for it--great god!
what must my uncle toby's have been, when 'twas all benignity without
it.

my father, as appears from many of his papers, was very subject to this
passion, before he married--but from a little subacid kind of drollish
impatience in his nature, whenever it befell him, he would never submit
to it like a christian; but would pish, and huff, and bounce, and kick,
and play the devil, and write the bitterest philippicks against the eye
that ever man wrote--there is one in verse upon somebody's eye or other,
that for two or

 rather towards malediction--only he did not do
it with as much method as ernulphus--he was too impetuous; nor with
ernulphus's policy--for tho' my father, with the most intolerant spirit,
would curse both this and that, and every thing under heaven, which was
either aiding or abetting to his love--yet never concluded his chapter
of curses upon it, without cursing himself in at the bargain, as one of
the most egregious fools and cox-combs, he would say, that ever was let
loose in the world.

my uncle toby, on the contrary, took it like a lamb--sat still and
let the poison work in his veins without resistance--in the sharpest
exacerbations of his wound (like that on his groin) he never dropt one
fretful or discontented word--he blamed neither heaven nor earth--or
thought or spoke an injurious thing of any body, or any part of it; he
sat solitary and pensive with his pipe--looking at his lame leg--then
whiffing out a sentimental heigh ho! which mixing with the smoke,
incommoded no one mortal.

he

took it like a lamb--i say.

in truth he had mistook it at first; for having taken a ride with my
father, that very morning, to save if possible a beautiful wood, which
the dean and chapter were hewing down to give to the poor (mr. shandy
must mean the poor in spirit; inasmuch as they divided the money amongst
themselves.); which said wood being in full view of my uncle toby's
house, and of singular service to him in his description of the battle
of wynnendale--by trotting on too hastily to save it--upon an uneasy
saddle--worse horse, &c. &c...it had so happened, that the serous part
of the blood had got betwixt the two skins, in the nethermost part of
my uncle toby--the first shootings of which (as my uncle toby had no
experience of love) he had taken for a part of the passion--till the
blister breaking in the one case--and the other remaining--my uncle toby
was p

resently convinced, that his wound was not a skin-deep wound--but
that it had gone to his heart.



chapter 4.li.

the world is ashamed of being virtuous--my uncle toby knew little of the
world; and therefore when he felt he was in love with widow wadman, he
had no conception that the thing was any more to be made a mystery of,
than if mrs. wadman had given him a cut with a gap'd knife across his
finger: had it been otherwise--yet as he ever look'd upon trim as a
humble friend; and saw fresh reasons every day of his life, to treat
him as such--it would have made no variation in the manner in which he
informed him of the affair.

of that story, trim?

--we lost it, an' please your honour, somehow betwixt us--but your
honour was as free from love then, as i am--'twas just whilst thou
went'st off with the wheel-barrow--with mrs. wadman, quoth my uncle

thundering attack upon her, in return--and telling her civilly
afterwards--for if she knows any thing of your honour's being in love,
before hand--l..d help her!--she knows no more at present of it, trim,
said my uncle toby--than the child unborn--

mrs. wadman had told it, with all its circumstances, to mrs. bridget
twenty-four hours before; and was at that very moment sitting in council
with her, touching some slight misgivings with regard to the issue of
the affairs, which the devil, who never lies dead in a ditch, had put
into her head--before he would allow half time, to get quietly through
her te deum.

i am terribly afraid, said widow wadman, in case i should marry him,
bridget--that the

i believe, besides, added she--that 'tis dried up--

--i could like to know--merely for his sake, said mrs. wadman--

--we'll know and long and the broad of it, in ten days--answered mrs.
bridget, for whilst the captain is paying his addresses to you--i'm
confident mr. trim will be for making love to me--and i'll let him as
much as he will--added bridget--to get it all out of him--

the measures were taken at once--and my uncle toby and the corporal went
on with theirs.

now, quoth the corporal, setting his left hand a-kimbo, and giving such
a flourish with his right, as just promised success--and no more--if
your honour will give me leave to lay down the plan of this attack--

--thou wilt please me by it, trim, said my uncle toby, exceedingly--and
as i foresee thou must act in it as my aid de camp, here's a crown,
corporal, to begin with, to steep thy commission.

then, an' please your honour, said the corporal (making a

bow first for
his commission)--we will begin with getting your honour's laced clothes
out of the great campaign-trunk, to be well air'd, and have the blue and
gold taken up at the sleeves--and i'll put your white ramallie-wig fresh
into pipes--and send for a taylor, to have your honour's thin scarlet
breeches turn'd--

--i had better take the red plush ones, quoth my uncle toby--they will
be too clumsy--said the corporal.

in your honour's way, replied trim.

my montero cap furbish'd up, and put on poor lieutenant le fever's

up boldly, as if 'twas to the face of a bastion; and whilst your honour
engages mrs. wadman in the parlour, to the right--i'll attack mrs.
bridget in the kitchen, to the left; and having seiz'd the pass,
i'll answer for it, said the corporal, snapping his fingers over his
head--that the day is our own.

i wish i may but manage it right; said my uncle toby--but i declare,
corporal, i had rather march up to the very edge of a trench--

--a woman is quite a different thing--said the corporal.

--i suppose so, quoth my uncle toby.



chapter 4.lv.

if any thing in this world, which my father said, could have provoked my
uncle toby, during the time he was in love, it was the perverse use my
father was always making of an expression of hilarion the hermit; who,
in speaking of his abstinence, his watchings, flagellations, and
other instrumental parts o

 his own ass, or else
of some other man's, during all that time.

i must here observe to you the difference betwixt my father's ass and my
hobby-horse--in order to keep characters as separate as may be, in our
fancies as we go along.

for my hobby-horse, if you recollect a little, is no way a vicious
beast; he has scarce one hair or lineament of the ass about him--'tis
the sporting little filly-folly which carries you out for the present
hour--a maggot, a butterfly, a picture, a fiddlestick--an uncle toby's
siege--or an any thing, which a man makes a shift to get a-stride on, to
canter it away from the cares and solicitudes of life--'tis as useful
a beast as is in the whole creation--nor do i really see how the world
could do without it--

--but for my father's ass--oh! mount him--mount him--mount him--(that's
three times, is it not?)--mount him not:--'tis a beast concupiscent--and
foul befal the man, who does not hinder him from kicking.

now my uncle toby thinking more of the part where he had had the
blister, than of hilarion's metaphor--and our preconceptions having (you
know) as great a power over the sounds of words as the shapes of things,
he had imagined, that my father, who was not very ceremonious in his
choice of words, had enquired after the part by its proper name: so
notwithstanding my mother, doctor slop, and mr. yorick, were sitting in
the parlour, he thought it rather civil to conform to the term my father
had made use of than not

my a..e, quoth my uncle toby, is much better--brother shandy--my father
had formed great expectations from his asse in this onset; and would
have brought him on again; but doctor slop setting up an intemperate
laugh--and my mother crying out l... bless us!--it drove my father's
asse off the field--and the laugh then becoming general--there was no
bringing him back to the charge, for some time--

and so the discourse went on without him.

every body, said my mother, says you are in love, brother toby,--and we
hope it is tru

i am as much in love, sister, i believe, replied my uncle toby, as any
man usually is--humph! said my father--and when did you know it? quoth
my mother--

--when the blister broke; replied my uncle toby.

my uncle toby's reply put my father into good temper--so he charg'd o'
foot.



chapter 4.lvii.

as the ancients agree, brother toby, said my father, that there are two
different and distinct kinds of love, according to the different parts
which are affected by it--the brain or liver--i think when a man is in
love, it behoves him a little to consider which of the two he is fallen
into.

what signifies it, brother shandy, replied my uncle toby, which of the
two it is, provided it will but make a man marry, an

--a few children! cried my father, rising out of his chair, and looking
full in my mother's face, as he forced his way betwixt her's and doctor
slop's--a few children! cried my father, repeating my uncle toby's words
as he walk'd to and fro--

--not, my dear brother toby, cried my father, recovering himself all at
once, and coming close up to the back of my uncle toby's chair--not
that i should be sorry hadst thou a score--on the contrary, i should
rejoice--and be as kind, toby, to every one of them as a father--

my uncle toby stole his hand unperceived behind his chair, to give my
father's a squeeze--

--nay, moreover, continued he, keeping hold of my uncle toby's hand--so
much dost thou possess, my dear toby, of the milk of human nature, and
so little of its asperities--'tis piteous the world is not peopled by
creatures which resemble thee; and was i an a

th his new project--i would oblige thee,
provided it would not impair thy strength--or dry up thy radical
moisture too fast--or weaken thy memory or fancy, brother toby, which
these gymnics inordinately taken are apt to do--else, dear toby, i would
procure thee the most beautiful woman in my empire, and i would oblige
thee, nolens, volens, to beget for me one subject every month--

as my father pronounced the last word of the sentence--my mother took a
pinch of snuff.

now i would not, quoth my uncle toby, get a child, nolens, volens, that
is, whether i would or no, to please the greatest prince upon earth--

--and 'twould be cruel in me, brother toby, to compel thee; said my
father--but 'tis a case put to shew thee, that it is not thy begetting
a child--in case thou should'st be able--but the system of love and
marriage thou goest upon, which i would set thee right in--

there is at least, said yorick, a great deal of reason and plain sense
in captain shandy's opinion of love; and 'tis amongst 
 
 ___________________________
 
ves--i know there
were two religions, replied yorick, amongst the ancients--one--for the
vulgar, and another for the learned;--but i think one love might have
served both of them very well--

i could not; replied my father--and for the same reasons: for of
these loves, according to ficinus's comment upon velasius, the one is
rational--

--the other is natural--the first ancient--without mother--where venus
had nothing to do: the second, begotten of jupiter and dione--

--pray, brother, quoth my uncle toby, what has a man who believes in
god to do with this? my father could not stop to answer, for fear of
breaking the thread of his discourse--

this latter, continued he, partakes wholly of the nature of venus.

the first, which is the golden chain let down from heaven, excites
to love heroic, which comprehends in it, and excites to the desire of
philosophy and truth--the second, excites to desire, simply--

--i think the procreation of children as beneficial to the world, said
yorick, as the find
 
 ___________________________
 
would defend it so gallantly, that 'twould have been a
concern, either to a brave man or a good-natured one, to have seen him
driven out.

yorick, for this reason, though he would often attack him--yet could
never bear to do it with all his force.

doctor slop's virginity, in the close of the last chapter, had got him
for once on the right side of the rampart; and he was beginning to blow
up all the convents in christendom about slop's ears, when corporal trim
came into the parlour to inform my uncle toby, that his thin scarlet
breeches, in which the attack was to be made upon mrs. wadman, would not
do; for that the taylor, in ripping them up, in order to turn them, had
found they had been turn'd before--then turn them again, brother, said
my father, rapidly, for there will be many a turning of 'em yet
before all's done in the affair--they are as rotten as dirt, said
the corporal--then by all means, said my father, bespeak a new pair,
brother--for though i know, continued my father, turning hims

 him--her
fever will be pass'd its height--

--she has gained her point.

in this case, continued my father, which plato, i am persuaded, never
thought of--love, you see, is not so much a sentiment as a situation,
into which a man enters, as my brother toby would do, into a corps--no
matter whether he loves the service or no--being once in it--he acts as
if he did; and takes every step to shew himself a man of prowesse.

the hypothesis, like the rest of my father's, was plausible enough, and
my uncle toby had but a single word to object to it--in which trim stood
ready to second him--but my father had not drawn his conclusion--

for this reason, continued my father (stating the case over
again)--notwithstanding all the world knows, that mrs. wadman affects my
brother toby--and my brother toby contrariwise affects mrs. wadman, and
no obstacle in nature to forbid the music striking up this very night,
yet will i answer for it, that this self-same tune will not be play'd
this twelvemonth.

we have 
 
 ___________________________
 
taken our measures badly, quoth my uncle toby, looking up
interrogatively in trim's face.

i would lay my montero-cap, said trim--now trim's montero-cap, as i once
told you, was his constant wager; and having furbish'd it up that
very night, in order to go upon the attack--it made the odds look more
considerable--i would lay, an' please your honour, my montero-cap to a
shilling--was it proper, continued trim (making a bow), to offer a wager
before your honours--

--there is nothing improper in it, said my father--'tis a mode of
expression;
 
 ___________________________
 
 for in saying thou would'st lay thy montero-cap to a
shilling--all thou meanest is this--that thou believest--

--now, what do'st thou believe?

that widow wadman, an' please your worship, cannot hold it out ten
days--

and whence, cried slop, jeeringly, hast thou all this knowledge of
woman, friend?

by falling in love with a popish clergy-woman; said trim.

'twas a beguine, said my uncle toby.

doctor slop was too much in wrath to listen to the distinction; and my
father taking that very crisis to fall in helter-skelter upon the whole
order of nuns and beguines, a set of silly, fusty, baggages--slop could
not stand it--and my uncle toby having some measures to take about his
breeches--and yorick about his fourth general division--in order for
their several attacks next day--the company broke up: and my father
being left alone, and having half an hour upon his hands betwixt that

the following letter of instructions:

my dear brother toby,

what i am going to say to thee is upon the nature of women, and of
love-making to them; and perhaps it is as well for thee--tho' not so
well for me--that thou hast occasion for a letter of instructions upon
that head, and that i am able to write it to thee.

had it been the good pleasure of him who disposes of our lots--and
thou no sufferer by the knowledge, i had been well content that thou
should'st have dipp'd the pen this moment

there is nothing further for thee, which occurs to me at present--

--unless the breaking out of a fresh war--so wishing every thing, dear
toby, for best,

i rest thy affectionate brother,

chapter 4.lix.

whilst my father was writing his letter of instructions, my uncle toby
and the corporal were busy in preparing every thing for the attack. as
the turning of the thin scarlet breeches was laid aside (at least for
the present), there was nothing which should put it off beyond the next
morning; so accordingly it was resolv'd upon, for eleven o'clock.

come, my dear, said my father to my mother--'twill be but like a brother
and sister, if you and i take a walk down to my brother toby's--to
countenance him in this attack of his.

my uncle toby and the corporal had been
 
 ___________________________
 
 accoutred both some time, when
my father and mother enter'd, and the clock striking eleven, were that
moment in motion to sally forth--but the account of this is worth more
than to be wove into the fag end of the eighth (alluding to the first
edition.) volume of such a work as this.--my father had no time but to
put the letter of instructions into my uncle toby's coat-pocket--and
join with my mother in wishing his attack prosperous.

i could like, said my mother, to look through the key-hole out of
curiosity--call it by its right name, my dear, quoth my father--

and look through the key-hole as long as you will.



chapter 4.lx.

i call all the powers of time and chance, which severally check us in
our careers in this world, to bear me witness, that i could never yet
get fairly to my uncle toby's amours, till this very moment, that my
mother's curios
 
 ___________________________
 
y father, was in attacking my mother's motive, instead
of the act itself; for certainly key-holes were made for other purposes;
and considering the act, as an act which interfered with a true
proposition, and denied a key-hole to be what it was--it became a
violation of nature; and was so far, you see, criminal.

it is for this reason, an' please your reverences, that key-holes are
the occasions of more sin and wickedness, than all other holes in this
world put together.

--which leads me to my uncle toby's amours.



chapter 4.lxi.

though the corporal had been as good as his word in putting my uncle
toby's great ramallie-wig into pipes, yet the time was too short to
produce any great effects from it: it had lain many years squeezed up in
the corner of his old campaign trunk; and as bad forms are not so
easy to be got the better of, and the use of candle-ends not so well
understood, it was not so pliable a business as one would have wished.
the corporal with cheary eye and both arms extended, h

perpendicular from it a score times, to inspire it, if possible, with
a better air--had spleen given a look at it, 'twould have cost her
ladyship a smile--it curl'd every where but where the corporal would
have it; and where a buckle or two, in his opinion, would have done it
honour, he could as soon have raised the dead.

such it was--or rather such would it have seem'd upon any other
brow; but the sweet look of goodness which sat upon my uncle toby's,
assimilated every thing around it so sovereignly to itself, and nature
had moreover wrote gentleman with so fair a hand in every line of his
countenance, that even his tarnish'd gold-laced hat and huge cockade of
flimsy taffeta became him; and though not worth a button in themselves,
yet the moment my uncle toby put them on, they became serious objects,
and altogether seem'd to have been picked up by the hand of science to
set him off to advantage.

nothing in this world could have co-operat

this, than my uncle toby's blue and gold--had not quantity in some
measure been necessary to grace: in a period of fifteen or sixteen years
since they had been made, by a total inactivity in my uncle toby's life,
for he seldom went further than the bowling-green--his blue and gold had
become so miserably too straight for him, that it was with the utmost
difficulty the corporal was able to get him into them; the taking them
up at the sleeves, was of no advantage.--they were laced however
down the back, and at the seams of the sides, &c. in the mode of king
william's reign; and to shorten all description, they shone so bright
against the sun that morning, and had so metallick and doughty an
air wi

th them, that had my uncle toby thought of attacking in armour,
nothing could have so well imposed upon his imagination.

as for the thin scarlet breeches, they had been unripp'd by the taylor
between the legs, and left at sixes and sevens--

--yes, madam,--but let us govern our fancies. it is enough they were
held impracticable the night before, and as there was no alternative in
my uncle toby's wardrobe, he sallied forth in the red plush.

the corporal had array'd himself in poor le fever's regimental coat; and
with his hair tuck'd up under his montero-cap, which he had furbish'd up
for the occasion, march'd three paces distant from his master: a whiff
of military pride had puff'd out his shirt at the wrist; and upon that
in a black leather thong clipp'd into a tassel beyond the knot, hung the
corporal's stick--my uncle toby carried his cane like a pike.

--it looks well at least; q

chapter 4.lxii.

my uncle toby turn'd his head more than once behind him, to see how he
was supported by the corporal; and the corporal as oft as he did it,
gave a slight flourish with his stick--but not vapouringly; and with the
sweetest accent of most respectful encouragement, bid his honour 'never
fear.'

now my uncle toby did fear; and grievously too; he knew not (as my
father had reproach'd him) so much as the right end of a woman from the
wrong, and therefore was never altogether at his ease near any one of
them--unless in sorrow or distress; then infinite was his pity; nor
would the most courteous knight of romance have gone further, at least
upon one leg, to have wiped away a tear from a woman's eye; and yet
excepting once that he was beguiled into it by mrs. wadman, he had
never looked stedfastly into one;

and would often tell my father in the
simplicity of his heart, that it was almost (if not about) as bad as
taking bawdy.--

chapter 4.lxiii.

she cannot, quoth my uncle toby, halting, when they had march'd up to
within twenty paces of mrs. wadman's door--she cannot, corporal, take it
amiss.--

--she will take it, an' please your honour, said the corporal, just as
the jew's widow at lisbon took it of my brother tom.--

--and how was that? quoth my uncle toby, facing quite about to the
corporal.

your honour, replied the corporal, knows of tom's misfortunes; but this
affair has nothing to do with them any further than this, that if tom
had not married the widow--or had it pleased god after their marriage,
that they had but put pork into their sausages, the honest soul
had never been taken out of his warm bed, and dragg'd to the
inquisition--'tis a cursed place--added the corporal, shaking his
head,--when once a poor creature is in, he is in, an' ple

'tis very true; said my uncle toby, looking gravely at mrs. wadman's
house, as he spoke.

nothing, continued the corporal, can be so sad as confinement for
life--or so sweet, an' please your honour, as liberty.

nothing, trim--said my uncle toby, musing--

whilst a man is free,--cried the corporal, giving a flourish with his
stick thus--

(squiggly line diagonally across the page)

a thousand of my father's most subtle syllogisms could not have said
more for celibacy.

my uncle toby look'd earnestly towards his cottage and his
bowling-green.

the corporal had unwarily conjured up the spirit of calculation with his
wand; and he had nothing to do, but to conjure him down again with his
story, and in this form of exorcism, most un-ecclesi

every servant in the family, from high to low, wish'd tom success; and i
can fancy, an' please your honour, i see him this moment with his white
dimity waist-coat and breeches, and hat a little o' one side, passing
jollily along the street, swinging his stick, with a smile and a
chearful word for every body he met:--but alas! tom! thou smilest no
more, cried the corporal, looking on one side of him upon the ground, as
if he apostrophised him in his dungeon.

poor fellow! said my uncle toby, feelingly.

he was an honest, light-hearted lad, an' please your honour, as ever
blood warm'd--

--then he resembled thee, trim, said my uncle toby, rapidly.

the corporal blush'd down to his fingers ends--a tear of sentimental
bashfulness--another of gratitude to my uncle toby--and a tear of sorrow
for his brother's misfortunes, started into his eye, and ran sweetly
down his cheek together; my uncle toby's kindled as one lamp does at
another; and taking hold of the breast of trim's coat (whic

 to ease his lame leg, but in reality to
gratify a finer feeling--he stood silent for a minute and a half; at the
end of which he took his hand away, and the corporal making a bow, went
on with his story of his brother and the jew's widow.



chapter 4.lxv.

when tom, an' please your honour, got to the shop, there was nobody in
it, but a poor negro girl, with a bunch of white feathers slightly tied
to the end of a long cane, flapping away flies--not killing them.--'tis
a pretty picture! said my uncle toby--she had suffered persecution,
trim, and had learnt mercy--

--she was good, an' please your honour, from nature, as well as from
hardships; and there are circumstances in the story of that poor
friendless slut, that would melt a heart of stone, said trim; and some
dismal winter's evening, when your honour is in the humour, they shall
be told you with the rest of tom's story, for it makes a part of it--

then do not forget, trim, said my uncle toby.

a negro has a soul? an' please your honour,

(doubtingly).

i am not much versed, corporal, quoth my uncle toby, in things of that
kind; but i suppose, god would not leave him without one, any more than
thee or me--

--it would be putting one sadly over the head of another, quoth the
corporal.

it would so; said my uncle toby. why then, an' please your honour, is a
black wench to be used worse than a white one?

i can give no reason, said my uncle toby--

--only, cried the corporal, shaking his head, because she has no one to
stand up for her--

--'tis that very thing, trim, quoth my uncle toby,--which recommends her
to protection--and her brethren with her; 'tis the fortune of war which
has put the whip into our hands now--where it may be hereafter, heaven
knows!--but be it where it will, the brave, trim! will not use it
unkindly.

--god forbid, said the corporal.

amen, responded my uncle toby, laying his hand upon his heart.

woman, an' please your
honour, whilst she is making sausages--so tom began a discourse upon
them; first, gravely,--'as how they were made--with what meats, herbs,
and spices.'--then a little gayly,--as, 'with what skins--and if they
never burst--whether the largest were not the best?'--and so on--taking
care only as he went along, to season what he had to say upon sausages,
rather under than over;--that he might have room to act in--

it was owing to the neglect of that very precaution, said my uncle toby,
laying his hand upon trim's shoulder, that count de la motte lost the
battle of wynendale: he pressed too speedily into the wood; which if he
had not done, lisle had not fallen into our hands, nor ghent and bruges,
which both followed her example; it was so late in the year, continued
my uncle toby, and so terrible a season came on, that if things had
not fallen out as they did, our troops must have perish'd in the open
field.--

--why, therefore, may not battles, an' please your honour, as we

marriages, be made in heaven?--my uncle toby mused--

religion inclined him to say one thing, and his high idea of military
skill tempted him to say another; so not being able to frame a reply
exactly to his mind--my uncle toby said nothing at all; and the corporal
finished his story.

as tom perceived, an' please your honour, that he gained ground, and
that all he had said upon the subject of sausages was kindly taken, he
went on to help her a little in making them.--first, by taking hold of
the ring of the sausage whilst she stroked the forced meat down with her
hand--then by cutting the strings into proper lengths, and holding them
in his hand, whilst she took them out one by one--then, by putting them

all womankind, continued trim, (commenting upon his story) from
the highest to the lowest, an' please your honour, love jokes; the
difficulty is to know how they chuse to have them cut; and there is no
knowing that, but by trying, as we do with our artillery in the field,
by raising or letting down their breeches, till we hit the mark.--

--i like the comparison, said my uncle toby, better than the thing
itself--

--because your honour, quoth the corporal, loves glory, more than
pleasure.

i hope, trim, answered my uncle toby, i love mankind more than either;
and as the knowledge of arms tends so apparently to the good and quiet
of the world--and particularly that branch of it which we have practised
together in our bowling-green, has no object but to shorten the strides
of ambition, and intrench the lives and fortunes of the few, from the
plunderings of the many--wheneve

in pronouncing this, my uncle toby faced about, and march'd firmly as
at the head of his company--and the faithful corporal, shouldering his
stick, and striking his hand upon his coat-skirt as he took his first
step--march'd close behind him down the avenue.

--now what can their two noddles be about? cried my father to my
mother--by all that's strange, they are besieging mrs. wadman in

groat.



chapter 4.lxix.

my mother had gone with her left arm twisted in my father's right, till
they had got to the fatal angle of the old garden wall, where doctor
slop was overthrown by obadiah on the coach-horse: as this was directly
opposite to the front of mrs. wadman's house, when my father came to it,
he gave a look across; and seeing my uncle toby and the corporal within
ten paces of the door, he turn'd about--'let us just stop a moment,
quoth my father, and see with what ceremonies my brother toby and his
man trim make their first entry--it will not detain us, added my father,
a single minute:'

--no matter, if it be ten minutes, quoth my mother.

--it will not detain us half one; said my father.

the corporal was just then setting in with the story of his brother
tom and the jew's widow: the story went on--and on--it had episodes in

the seventy-fourth chapter is come at last; and brings nothing with it
but a sad signature of 'how our pleasures slip from under us in this
world!'

for in talking of my digression--i declare before heaven i have made it!
what a strange creature is mortal man! said she.

'tis very true, said i--but 'twere better to get all these things out of
our heads, and return to my uncle toby.



chapter 4.lxxv.

when my uncle toby and the corporal had marched down to the bottom of
the avenue, they recollected their business lay the other way; so they
faced about and marched up straight to mrs. wadman's door.

i warrant your honour; said the corporal, touching his montero-cap with
his hand, as he passed him in order to give a knock at the door--my
uncle toby, contrary to his invariable way of treating his faithful
servant, said nothing good or bad: the truth was, he had not altogeth

marshal'd his ideas; he wish'd for another conference, and as the
corporal was mounting up the three steps before the door--he hem'd
twice--a portion of my uncle toby's most modest spirits fled, at each
expulsion, towards the corporal; he stood with the rapper of the door
suspended for a full minute in his hand, he scarce knew why. bridget
stood perdue within, with her finger and her thumb upon the latch,
benumb'd with expectation; and mrs. wadman, with an eye ready to be
deflowered again, sat breathless behind the window-curtain of her
bed-chamber, watching their approach.

trim! said my uncle toby--but as he articulated the word, the minute

my uncle toby perceiving that all hopes of a conference were knock'd on
the head by it--whistled lillabullero.



chapter 4.lxxvi.

as mrs. bridget's finger and thumb were upon the latch, the corporal did
not knock as often as perchance your honour's taylor--i might have taken
my example something nearer home; for i owe mine, some five and twenty
pounds at least, and wonder at the man's patience--

chapter 4.lxxix.

--(two blank paragraphs)--

--you shall see the very place, madam; said my uncle toby.

mrs. wadman blush'd--look'd towards the door--turn'd pale--blush'd
slightly again--recover'd her natural colour--blush'd worse than ever;
which, for the sake of the unlearned reader, i translate thus--

'l..d! i cannot look at it--

'what would the world say if i look'd at it?

'i should drop down, if i look'd at it--

'i wish i could look at it--

'there can be no sin in looking at it.

--'i will look at it.'

whilst all this was running through mrs. wadman's imagination, my uncle
toby had r

isen from the sopha, and got to the other side of the parlour
door, to give trim an order about it in the passage--

...--i believe it is in the garret, said my uncle toby--i saw it there,
an' please your honour, this morning, answered trim--then prithee,
step directly for it, trim, said my uncle toby, and bring it into the
parlour.

the corporal did not approve of the orders, but most cheerfully obeyed
them. the first was not an act of his will--the second was; so he put
on his montero-cap, and went as fast as his lame knee would let him. my
uncle toby returned into the parlour, and sat himself down again upon
the sopha.

--you shall lay your finger upon the place--said my uncle toby.--i will
not touch it, however, quoth mrs. wadman to herself.

this requires a second translation:--it shews

little platonic exigences of that part of the species, for whose use she
is fabricating this--or that her ladyship sometimes scarce knows what
sort of a husband will do--i know not: we will discourse about it after
supper.

it is enough, that neither the observation itself, or the reasoning upon
it, are at all to the purpose--but rather against it; since with regard
to my uncle toby's fitness for the marriage state, nothing was ever
better: she had formed him of the best and kindliest clay--had temper'd
it with her own milk, and breathed into it the sweetest spirit--she had
made him all gentle, generous, and humane--she had filled his heart with
trust and confidence, and disposed every passage which led to it, for
the communication of the tenderest offices--she had moreover considered
the other causes for which matrimony was ordained--

and accordingly....

s not defeated by my uncle toby's wound.

now this last article was somewhat apocryphal; and the devil, who is the
great disturber of our faiths in this world, had raised scruples in mrs.
wadman's brain about it; and like a true devil as he was, had done his
own work at the same time, by turning my uncle toby's virtue thereupon
into nothing but empty bottles, tripes, trunk-hose, and pantofles.



chapter 4.lxxxii.

mrs. bridget had pawn'd all the little stock of honour a poor
chamber-maid was worth in the world, that she would get to the bottom
of the affair in ten days; and it was built upon one of the most
concessible postulata in nature: namely, that whilst my uncle toby was
making love to her mistress, the corporal could find nothing better to
do, than make love to her--'and i'll let him as much

 as he will, said
bridget, to get it out of him.'

friendship has two garments; an outer and an under one. bridget was
serving her mistress's interests in the one--and doing the thing which
most pleased herself in the other: so had as many stakes depending
upon my uncle toby's wound, as the devil himself--mrs. wadman had but
one--and as it possibly might be her last (without discouraging mrs.
bridget, or discrediting her talents) was determined to play her cards
herself.

she wanted not encouragement: a child might have look'd into his
hand--there was such a plainness and simplicity in his playing out what
trumps he had--with such an unmistrusting ignorance of the ten-ace--and
so naked and defenceless did he sit upon the same sopha with widow
wadman, that a generou

disappointment sitting drooping upon the eye of your fair hostess and
her damsels in the gate-way, at your departure--and besides, my dear
sir, you get a sisterly kiss of each of 'em worth a pound--at least i

--for my uncle toby's amours running all the way in my head, they had
the same effect upon me as if they had been my own--i was in the most
perfect state of bounty and good-will; and felt the kindliest harmony
vibrating within me, with every oscillation of the chaise alike; so that
whether the roads were rough or smooth, it made no difference; every
thing i saw or had to do with, touch'd upon some secret spring either of
sentiment or rapture.

--they were the sweetest notes i ever heard; and i instantly let down

as bridget said, as much as they please; for how was it possible they

my book, before the 77th, &c?

--so i don't take it amiss--all i wish is, that it may be a lesson to
the world, 'to let people tell their stories their own way.'



the seventy-seventh chapter.

as mrs. bridget opened the door before the corporal had well given the
rap, the interval betwixt that and my uncle toby's introduction into the
parlour, was so short, that mrs. wadman had but just time to get from
behind the curtain--lay a bible upon the table, and advance a step or
two towards the door to receive him.

my uncle toby saluted mrs. wadman, after the manner in which women were
saluted by men in the year of our lord god one thousand seven hundred
and thirteen--then facing about, he march'd up abreast with her to the
sopha, and in three plain words--though not before he was sat down--nor
after he was
 
 ___________________________
 
 sat down--but as he was sitting down, told her, 'he was in
love'--so that my uncle toby strained himself more in the declaration
than he needed.

mrs. wadman naturally looked down, upon a slit she had been darning up
in her apron, in expectation every moment, that my uncle toby would go
on; but having no talents for amplification, and love moreover of all
others being a subject of which he was the least a master--when he had
told mrs. wadman once that he loved her, he let it alone, and left the
matter to work after its own way.

my father was always in raptures with this system of my uncle toby's, as
he falsely called it, and would often say, that could his brother toby
to his processe have added but a pipe of tobacco--he had wherewithal to
have found his way, if ther
 
 ___________________________
 
e was faith in a spanish proverb, towards the
hearts of half the women upon the globe.

my uncle toby never understood what my father meant; nor will i presume
to extract more from it, than a condemnation of an error which the bulk
of the world lie under--but the french, every one of 'em to a man, who
believe in it, almost as much as the real presence, 'that talking of
love, is making it.'

--i would as soon set about making a black-pudding by the same receipt.

let us go on: mrs. wadman sat in expectation my uncle toby would do so,
to almost the first pulsation of that minute, wherein silence 
 
 ___________________________
 
on one
side or the other, generally becomes indecent: so edging herself a
little more towards him, and raising up her eyes, sub blushing, as
she did it--she took up the gauntlet--or the discourse (if you like it
better) and communed with my uncle toby, thus:

the cares and disquietudes of the marriage state, quoth mrs. wadman,
are very great. i suppose so--said my uncle toby: and therefore when
a person, continued mrs. wadman, is so much at his ease as you are--so
happy, captain shandy, in yourself, your friends and your amusements--i
wonder, what reasons can incline you to the state--

--they are written, quoth my uncle toby, in the common-prayer book.

thus far my uncle toby went on warily, and kept within his depth,
leaving mrs. wadman to sail upon the gulph as she pleased.

--as for children--said mrs. wadman--though a principal end perhaps of
the institution, 
 
 ___________________________
 
and the natural wish, i suppose, of every parent--yet
do not we all find, they are certain sorrows, and very uncertain
comforts? and what is there, dear sir, to pay one for the
heart-achs--what compensation for the many tender and disquieting
apprehensions of a suffering and defenceless mother who brings them into
life? i declare, said my uncle toby, smit with pity, i know of none;
unless it be the pleasure which it has pleased god--

a fiddlestick! quoth she.



chapter 4.the seventy-eighth.

now there are such an infinitude of notes, tunes, cants, chants, airs,
looks, and accents with which the word fiddlestick may be pronounced in
all such causes as this, every one of 'em impressing a sense and meaning
as different from the other, as dirt from cleanliness--that casuists
(for it is an affair of conscience on that score) reckon up no less
 
 ___________________________
 
 than
fourteen thousand in which you may do either right or wrong.

mrs. wadman hit upon the fiddlestick, which summoned up all my uncle
toby's modest blood into his cheeks--so feeling within himself that he
had somehow or other got beyond his depth, he stopt short; and without
entering further either into the pains or pleasures of matrimony, he
laid his hand upon his heart, and made an offer to take them as they
were, and share them along with her.

when my uncle toby had said this, he did not care to say it again;
so casting his eye upon the bible which mrs. wadman had laid upon the
table, he took it up; and popping, dear soul! upon a passage in it,
of all others the most interesting to him--which was the siege of
jericho--he set himself to read it over--leaving his proposal of
marriage, as he had done his declaration of love, to work with her after
its own way. now it wrought neither as an astringent or a loosener; nor
like opium, or bark, or mercury, or b
 
 ___________________________
 
likewise from her own powers--laid down theorems--drawn
consequences, and come to no conclusion.

to clear up all, she had twice asked doctor slop, 'if poor captain
shandy was ever likely to recover of his wound--?'

--he is recovered, doctor slop would say--

what! quite?

quite: madam--

but what do you mean by a recovery? mrs. wadman would say.

doctor slop was the worst man alive at definitions; and so mrs. wadman
could get no knowledge: in short, there was no way to extract it, but
from my uncle toby himself.

there is an accent of humanity in an enquiry of this kind which lulls
suspicion to rest--and i am half persuaded the serpent got pretty near
it, in his discourse with eve; for the propensity in the sex to be
deceived could not be so great, that she should have boldness to hold
chat with the devil, without it--but there is an accent of humanity--how
shall i describe it?--'tis an accent which covers the part with a
garment, and gives the enquirer a right to be as particular with it, as

'--was it without remission?--

'--was it more tolerable in bed?

'--could he lie on both sides alike with it?

'--was he able to mount a horse?

'--was motion bad for it?' et caetera, were so tenderly spoke to, and so
directed towards my uncle toby's heart, that every item of them sunk
ten times deeper into it than the evils themselves--but when mrs. wadman
went round about by namur to get at my uncle toby's groin; and engaged
him to attack the point of the advanced counterscarp, and pele mele with
the dutch to take the counterguard of st. roch sword in hand--and then
with tender notes playing upon his ear, led him all bleeding by the
hand out of the trench, wiping her eye, as he was carried to his
tent--heaven! earth! sea!--all was lifted up--the springs of nature rose
above their levels--an angel of mercy sat besides him on the sopha--his
heart glow'd with fire--and had he been worth a thousand

, he had lost
every heart of them to mrs. wadman.

--and whereabouts, dear sir, quoth mrs. wadman, a little categorically,
did you receive this sad blow?--in asking this question, mrs. wadman
gave a slight glance towards the waistband of my uncle toby's red plush
breeches, expecting naturally, as the shortest reply to it, that
my uncle toby would lay his fore-finger upon the place--it fell out
otherwise--for my uncle toby having got his wound before the gate of st.
nicolas, in one of the traverses of the trench opposite to the salient
angle of the demibastion of st. roch; he could at any time stick a pin
upon the identical spot of ground where he was standing when the stone
struck him: this struck instantly upon my uncle toby's sensorium--and
with it, struck his large map of the town and citadel of namur and its
environs, which he had purchased and pasted down upon a board, by the
corporal's aid, during his long
 
 ___________________________
 
 illness--it had lain with other military
lumber in the garret ever since, and accordingly the corporal was
detached to the garret to fetch it.

my uncle toby measured off thirty toises, with mrs. wadman's scissars,
from the returning angle before the gate of st. nicolas; and with such
a virgin modesty laid her finger upon the place, that the goddess of
decency, if then in being--if not, 'twas her shade--shook her head,
and with a finger wavering across her eyes--forbid her to explain the
mistake.

unhappy mrs. wadman!

--for nothing can make this chapter go off with spirit but an apostrophe
to thee--but my heart tells me, that in such a crisis an ap

my uncle toby's map is carried down into the kitchen.



chapter 4.lxxxvii.

--and here is the maes--and this is the sambre; said the corporal,
pointing with his right hand extended a little towards the map, and his
left upon mrs. bridget's shoulder--but not the shoulder next him--and
this, said he, is the town of namur--and this the citadel--and there
lay the french--and here lay his honour and myself--and in this cursed
trench, mrs. bridget, quoth the corporal, taking her by the hand, did he

chapter 4.lxxxviii.

it was like the momentary contest in the moist eye-lids of an april
morning, 'whether bridget should laugh or cry.'

she snatch'd up a rolling-pin--'twas ten to one, she had laugh'd--

she laid it down--she cried; and had one single tear of 'em but tasted
of bitterness, full sorrowful would the corporal's heart have been that
he had used the argument; but the corporal understood the sex, a quart
major to a terce at least, better than my uncle toby, and accordingly he
assailed mrs. bridget after this manner.

i know, mrs. bridget, said the corporal, giving her a most respectful
kiss, that thou art good and modest by nature, and art withal so
generous a girl in thyself, that, if i know thee rightly, thou would'st
not wound an insect, much less the honour of so gallant and worthy a
soul as my master, wast thou sure to be made a countess of--but thou
hast been set on, and deluded, dear bridget, as is often a woman's case,
'to please others m
 
 ___________________________
 
ore than themselves--'

bridget's eyes poured down at the sensations the corporal excited.

--tell me--tell me, then, my dear bridget, continued the corporal,
taking hold of her hand, which hung down dead by her side,--and giving a
second kiss--whose suspicion has misled thee?

bridget sobb'd a sob or two--then open'd her eyes--the corporal wiped
'em with the bottom of her apron--she then open'd her heart and told him
all.



chapter 4.lxxxix.

my uncle toby and the corporal had gone on separately with their
operations the greatest part of the campaign, and as effectually cut
off from all communication of what either the one or the other had been
doing, as if they had been separated from each other by the maes or the
sambre.

my uncle toby, on his side, had presented himself every afternoon in his
red and silver, and blue and gold alternately, and sustained an infinity
of attacks in them, without knowing them to be attacks--and so had
nothing to co

hem, required so nice an historian, that the corporal durst not
venture upon it; and as sensible as he was of glory, would rather have
been contented to have gone bareheaded and without laurels for ever,
than torture his master's modesty for a single moment--

--best of honest and gallant servants!--but i have apostrophiz'd thee,
trim! once before--and could i apotheosize thee also (that is to say)
with good company--i would do it without ceremony in the very next page.



chapter 4.xc.

now my uncle toby had one evening laid down his pipe upon the table,
and was counting over to himself upon his finger ends (beginning at his
thumb) all mrs. wadman's perfections one by one; and happening two or
three times together, either by omitting some, or counting others twice
over, to puzzle himself sadly before he could get beyond his middle
finger--prithee, trim! said he, taking up his pipe again,--bring me a
pen and ink: trim brought paper also.

take a full sheet--trim! said my uncle toby, making a sig
 
 ___________________________
 
n with his pipe
at the same time to take a chair and sit down close by him at the table.
the corporal obeyed--placed the paper directly before him--took a pen,
and dipp'd it in the ink.

--she has a thousand virtues, trim! said my uncle toby--

am i to set them down, an' please your honour? quoth the corporal.

--but they must be taken in their ranks, replied my uncle toby; for of
them all, trim, that which wins me most, and which is a security for
all the rest, is the compassionate turn and singular humanity of her
character--i protest, added my uncle toby, looking up, as he protested
it, towards the top of the ceiling--that was i her brother, trim, a
thousand fold, she could not make more constant or more tender enquiries
after my sufferings--though now no more.

the corporal made no reply to my uncle toby's protestation, but by a
short cough--he dipp'd the pen
 
 ___________________________
 
 a second time into the inkhorn; and my
uncle toby, pointing with the end of his pipe as close to the top of the
sheet at the left hand corner of it, as he could get it--the corporal
wrote down the word humanity...thus.

prithee, corporal, said my uncle toby, as soon as trim had done it--how
often does mrs. bridget enquire after the wound on the cap of thy knee,
which thou received'st at the battle of landen?

she never, an' please your honour, enquires after it at all.

that, corporal, said my uncle toby, with all the triumph the goodness of
his nature would permit--that shews the difference in the character
of the mistress and maid--had the fortune of war allotted the same
mischance to me, mrs. wadman would have enquired into every circumstance
relating to it a hundred times--she would have enquired, an' please your
honour, ten times as often about your honour's groin--the pain, trim, is
equally excruciating,--and compassion has as much to do with the one as
the other--

--god bless your honou
 
 ___________________________
 
r! cried the corporal--what has a woman's
compassion to do with a wound upon the cap of a man's knee? had your
honour's been shot into ten thousand splinters at the affair of landen,
mrs. wadman would have troubled her head as little about it as bridget;
because, added the corporal, lowering his voice, and speaking very
distinctly, as he assigned his reason--

'the knee is such a distance from the main body--whereas the groin, your
honour knows, is upon the very curtain of the place.'

my uncle toby gave a long whistle--but in a note which could scarce be
heard across the table.

the corporal had advanced too far to retire--in three words he told the
rest--

my uncle toby laid down his pipe as gently upon the fender, as if it had
been spun from the unravellings of a spider's web--

--let us go to my brother shandy's, said he.



chapter 4.xci.

there will be just time, whilst my uncle toby and trim are walking to
my father's, to inform you that mrs. wadman had, some moons before this,

them upon the house-top--in a word, not an old woman in the village or
five miles round, who did not understand the difficulties of my uncle
toby's siege, and what were the secret articles which had delayed the
surrender.--

my father, whose way was to force every event in nature into an
hypothesis, by which means never man crucified truth at the rate he
did--had but just heard of the report as my uncle toby set out; and
catching fire suddenly at the trespass done his brother by it, was
demonstrating to yorick, notwithstanding my mother was sitting by--not
only, 'that the devil was in women, and that the whole of the affair was
lust;' but that every evil and disorder in the world, of what kind or
nature soever, from the first fall of adam, down to my uncle toby's
(inclusive), was owing one way or other to the same unruly appetite.

yorick was just bringing my father's hypothesis to some temper, whe

filled his pipe, my father broke out in this manner.

a passion which bends down the faculties, and turns all the wisdom,
contemplations, and operations of the soul backwards--

instruments, and whatever serves thereto, are so held as to be conveyed

--the act of killing and destroying a man, continued my father, raising
his voice--and turning to my uncle toby--you see, is glorious--and the
