 and with a burning wound
  transfix'd, and naked, on a rock she bound.
  but i, who walk in awful state above,
  the majesty of heav'n, the sister wife of jove,
  for length of years my fruitless force employ
  against the thin remains of ruin'd troy!
  what nations now to juno's pow'r will pray,
  or off'rings on my slighted altars lay?"

  thus rag'd the goddess; and, with fury fraught.
  the restless regions of the storms she sought,
  where, in a spacious cave of living stone,
  the tyrant aeolus, from his airy throne,
  with pow'r imperial curbs the struggling winds,
  and sounding tempests in dark prisons binds.
  this way and that th' impatient captives tend,
  and, pressing for release, the mountains rend.
  high in his hall th' undaunted monarch stands,
  and shakes his scepter, and their rage commands;
  which did he not, their unresisted sway
  would sweep the world before them in their way;
  earth, air, and seas thro' empty space would roll,
  and heav'n would fly before the dr

  in fear of this, the father of the gods
  confin'd their fury to those dark abodes,
  and lock'd 'em safe within, oppress'd with mountain loads;
  impos'd a king, with arbitrary sway,
  to loose their fetters, or their force allay.
  to whom the suppliant queen her pray'rs address'd,
  and thus the tenor of her suit express'd:

  "o aeolus! for to thee the king of heav'n
  the pow'r of tempests and of winds has giv'n;
  thy force alone their fury can restrain,
  and smooth the waves, or swell the troubled main-
  a race of wand'ring slaves, abhorr'd by me,
  with prosp'rous passage cut the tuscan sea;
  to fruitful italy their course they steer,
  and for their vanquish'd gods design new temples there.
  raise all thy winds; with night involve the skies;
  sink or disperse my fatal enemies.

r hate:
  ev'n jove is thwarted by his haughty wife;
  still vanquish'd, yet she still renews the strife.
  as if 't were little to consume the town
  which aw'd the world, and wore th' imperial crown,
  she prosecutes the ghost of troy with pains,
  and gnaws, ev'n to the bones, the last remains.
  let her the causes of her hatred tell;
  but you can witness its effects too well.
  you saw the storm she rais'd on libyan floods,
  that mix'd the mounting billows with the clouds;
  when, bribing aeolus, she shook the main,
  and mov'd rebellion in your wat'ry reign.
  with fury she possess'd the dardan dames,
  to burn their fleet with execrable flames,
  and forc'd aeneas, when his ships were lost,
  to leave his foll'wers on a foreign coast.
  for what remains, your godhead i implore,
  and trust my son to your protecting pow'r.
  if neither jove's nor fate's decree withstand,
  secure his passage to the latian land."

  then thus the mighty ruler of the main:
  "what may not venus hope fro

  one more audacious mortal will be found;
  and i, thy daughter, wait another wound.
  yet, if with fates averse, without thy leave,
  the latian lands my progeny receive,
  bear they the pains of violated law,
  and thy protection from their aid withdraw.
  but, if the gods their sure success foretell;
  if those of heav'n consent with those of hell,
  to promise italy; who dare debate
  the pow'r of jove, or fix another fate?
  what should i tell of tempests on the main,
  of aeolus usurping neptune's reign?
  of iris sent, with bacchanalian heat
  t' inspire the matrons, and destroy the fleet?
  now juno to the stygian sky descends,
  solicits hell for aid, and arms the fiends.
  that new example wanted yet above:
  an act that well became the wife of jove!
  alecto, rais'd by her, with rage inflames
  the peaceful bosoms of the latian dames.
  imperial sway no more exalts my mind;
  (such hopes i had indeed, while heav'n was kind;)
