introduction.


from munich, on june 29, 1890, ibsen wrote to the swedish poet, count
carl soilsky: "our intention has all along been to spend the summer in
the tyrol again. but circumstances are against our doing so. i am at
present engaged upon a new dramatic work, which for several reasons has
made very slow progress, and i do not leave munich until i can take with
me the completed first dr

or: "my new play is finished; the manuscript went off to copenhagen
the day before yesterday.... it produces a curious feeling of emptiness
to be thus suddenly separated from a work which has occupied one's time
and thoughts for several months, to the exclusion of all else. but it is
a good thing, too, to have done with it. the constant intercourse with
the fictitious personages was beginning to make me quite nervous." to
the same correspondent he wrote on december 4: "the title of the play is
_hedda gabler_. my intention in giving it this name was to indicate
that hedda, as a personality, is to be regarded rather as her father's
daughter than as her husband's wife. it was not my desire to deal in
this play with so-called problems. what i principally wanted to do was
to depict human beings, human emotions, and human destinies, upon a
groundwork of certain of the social conditions and principles of the
present day."

so far we read the history of the play in the official
"correspondence."(1) some i

nteresting glimpses into the poet's moods
during the period between the completion of _the lady from the sea_
and the publication of _hedda gabler_ are to be found in the series of
letters to fraulein emilie bardach, of vienna, published by dr. george
brandes.(2) this young lady ibsen met at gossensass in the tyrol in
the autumn of 1889. the record of their brief friendship belongs to the
history of _the master builder_ rather than to that of _hedda gabler_,
but the allusions to his work in his letters to her during the winter of
1889 demand some examination.

so early as october 7, 1889, he writes to her: "a new poem begins to
dawn in me. i will execute it this winter, and try to transfer to it
the bright atmosphere of the summer. but i feel that it will end in
sadness--such is my nature." was this "dawning" poem _hedda gabler_? or
was it rather _the master builder_ that was germinating in his mind? who
shall say? the latter hypothesis seems the

 more probable, for it is hard
to believe that at any stage in the incubation of _hedda gabler_ he can
have conceived it as even beginning in gaiety. a week later, however,
he appears to have made up his mind that the time had not come for the
poetic utilisation of his recent experiences. he writes on october 15:
"here i sit as usual at my writing-table. now i would fain work, but
am unable to. my fancy, indeed, is very active. but it always wanders
away ours. i cannot repress my summer memories--nor do i wish to. i live
through my experience again and again and yet again. to transmute i

t
all into a poem, i find, in the meantime, impossible." clearly, then,
he felt that his imagination ought to have been engaged on some theme
having no relation to his summer experiences--the theme, no doubt, of
_hedda gabler_. in his next letter, dated october 29, he writes: "do not
be troubled because i cannot, in the meantime, create (_dichten_). in
reality i am for ever creating, or, at any rate, dreaming of something
which, when in the fulness of time it ripens, will reveal itself as
a creation (_dichtung_)." on november 19 he says: "i am very busily
occupied with preparations for my new poem. i sit almost the whole day
at my writing-table. go out only in the evening for a little while." the

ers contain no allusion to the play; but on september
18, 1890, he wrote: "my wife and son are at present at riva, on the lake
of garda, and will probably remain there until the middle of october,
or even longer. thus i am quite alone here, and cannot get away. the new
play on which i am at present engaged will probably not be ready until
november, though i sit at my writing-table daily, and almost the whole
day long."

here ends the history of _hedda gabler_, so far as the poet's
letters carry us. its hard clear outlines, and perhaps somewhat bleak
atmosphere, seem to have resulted from a sort of reaction against the
sentimental "dreamery" begotten of his gossensass experiences. he
sought refuge in the chill materialism of hedda from the ardent
transcendentalism of hilda, whom he already heard knocking at the door.
he was not yet in the mood to deal with her on the plane of poetry.(3)

_hedda gabler_ was published in copenhagen on december 16, 189

 performance of hedda many times, in london,
in the english provinces, and in new york. the character has also been
acted in london by eleonora duse, and as i write (march, 5, 1907) by
mrs. patrick campbell, at the court theatre. in australia and america,
hedda has frequently been acted by miss nance o'neill and other
actresses--quite recently by a russian actress, madame alla nazimova,
who (playing in english) seems to have made a notable success both in
this part and in nora. the first french hedda gabler was mlle. marthe
brandes, who played the part at the vaudeville theatre, paris, on
december 17, 1891, the performance being introduced by a lecture by m.
jules lemaitre. in holland, in italy, in russia, the play has been acted
times without number. in short (as might easily have been foretold) it
has rivalled _a doll's house_ in world-wide popularity.

it has been suggested,(4) i think without sufficient ground, that ibsen
deliberately conceived _hedda gabler_ as an "international" play, and

legatee. but many other legatees were mentioned in the instrument--all
of them ladies, such as fraulein alma rothbart, of bremen, and fraulein
elise kraushaar, of berlin. the bequests to these meritorious spinsters
were so generous that their sum considerably exceeded the amount of
the testator's property. ibsen gently but firmly declined the proffered
inheritance; but holm's will no doubt suggested to him the figure of
that red-haired "mademoiselle diana," who is heard of but not seen
in _hedda gabler_, and enabled him to add some further traits to the
portraiture of lovborg. when the play appeared, holm recognised
himself with glee in the character of the bibulous man of letters,
and thereafter adopted "eilert lovborg" as his pseudonym. i do not,
therefore, see why dr. brandes should suppress his real name; but i
willingly imitate him in erring on the side of discretion. the poor
fellow died several years ago.

some critics have been greatly troubled as to the precise meaning of

 or his excursion into a new field,
strikes the average scholar of the tesman type. he is, in fact, "trying
it on the dog"--neither an unreasonable nor an unusual proceeding. there
is, no doubt, a certain improbability in the way in which lovborg is
represented as carrying his manuscript around, and especially in mrs.
elvsted's production of his rough draft from her pocket; but these are
mechanical trifles, on which only a niggling criticism would dream of
laying stress.

of all ibsen's works, _hedda gabler_ is the most detached, the most
objective--a character-study pure and simple. it is impossible--or so
it seems to me--to extract any sort of general idea from it. one cannot
even call it a satire, unless one is prepared to apply that term to the
record of a "case" in a work of criminology. reverting to dumas's dictum
that a play should contain "a painting, a judgment, an ideal," we may
say the _hedda gabler_ fulfils only the first of these requirements. the
poet does not even pass judgment on h
