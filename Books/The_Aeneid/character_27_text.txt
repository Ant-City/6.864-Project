ace;
  all that i saw, and part of which i was:
  not ev'n the hardest of our foes could hear,
  nor stern ulysses tell without a tear.
  and now the latter watch of wasting night,
  and setting stars, to kindly rest invite;
  but, since you take such int'rest in our woe,
  and troy's disastrous end desire to know,
  i will restrain my tears, and briefly tell
  what in our last and fatal night befell.

  "by destiny compell'd, and in despair,
  the greeks grew weary of the tedious war,
  and by minerva's aid a fabric rear'd,
  which like a steed of monstrous height appear'd:
  the sides were plank'd with pine; they feign'd it made
  for their return, and this the vow they paid.
  thus they pretend, but in the hollow side
  selected numbers of their soldiers hide:
  with inward arms the dire machine they load,
  and iron bowels stuff the dark abode.
  in sight of troy lies tenedos, an isle
  (while fortune did on priam's empire smile)
  renown'd for wealth; but, since, a faithless bay,
  where

  inviolable pow'rs, ador'd with dread!
  ye fatal fillets, that once bound this head!
  ye sacred altars, from whose flames i fled!
  be all of you adjur'd; and grant i may,
  without a crime, th' ungrateful greeks betray,
  reveal the secrets of the guilty state,
  and justly punish whom i justly hate!
  but you, o king, preserve the faith you gave,
  if i, to save myself, your empire save.
  the grecian hopes, and all th' attempts they made,
  were only founded on minerva's aid.
  but from the time when impious diomede,
  and false ulysses, that inventive head,
  her fatal image from the temple drew,
  the sleeping guardians of the castle slew,
  her virgin statue with their bloody hands
  polluted, and profan'd her holy bands;
  from thence the tide of fortune left their shore,
  and ebb'd much faster than it flow'd before:
  their courage languish'd, as their hopes decay'd;
  and pallas, now averse, refus'd her aid.
  nor did the goddess doubtfully declare

  but first, to reconcile the blue-ey'd maid
  for her stol'n statue and her tow'r betray'd,
  warn'd by the seer, to her offended name
  we rais'd and dedicate this wondrous frame,
  so lofty, lest thro' your forbidden gates
  it pass, and intercept our better fates:
  for, once admitted there, our hopes are lost;
  and troy may then a new palladium boast;
  for so religion and the gods ordain,
  that, if you violate with hands profane
  minerva's gift, your town in flames shall burn,
  (which omen, o ye gods, on graecia turn!)
  but if it climb, with your assisting hands,
  the trojan walls, and in the city stands;
  then troy shall argos and mycenae burn,
  and the reverse of fate on us return.'

  "with such deceits he gain'd their easy hearts,
  too prone to credit his perfidious arts.
  what diomede, nor thetis' greater son,
  a thousand ships, nor ten years' siege, had done-
  false tears and fawning words the city won.

  unknown, assaulting whom we blindly meet,
  and strew with grecian carcasses the street.
  thus while their straggling parties we defeat,
  some to the shore and safer ships retreat;
  and some, oppress'd with more ignoble fear,
  remount the hollow horse, and pant in secret there.

  "but, ah! what use of valor can be made,
  when heav'n's propitious pow'rs refuse their aid!
  behold the royal prophetess, the fair
  cassandra, dragg'd by her dishevel'd hair,
  whom not minerva's shrine, nor sacred bands,
  in safety could protect from sacrilegious hands:
  on heav'n she cast her eyes, she sigh'd, she cried-
  't was all she could- her tender arms were tied.
  so sad a sight coroebus could not bear;
  but, fir'd with rage, distracted with despair,
  amid the barb'rous ravishers he flew:
  our leader's rash example we pursue.
  but storms of stones, from the proud temple's height,
  pour down, and on our batter'd helms alight:

  achates first pronounc'd the joyful sound;
  then, 'italy!' the cheerful crew rebound.
  my sire anchises crown'd a cup with wine,
  and, off'ring, thus implor'd the pow'rs divine:
  'ye gods, presiding over lands and seas,
  and you who raging winds and waves appease,
  breathe on our swelling sails a prosp'rous wind,
  and smooth our passage to the port assign'd!'
  the gentle gales their flagging force renew,
  and now the happy harbor is in view.
  minerva's temple then salutes our sight,
  plac'd, as a landmark, on the mountain's height.
  we furl our sails, and turn the prows to shore;
  the curling waters round the galleys roar.
  the land lies open to the raging east,
  then, bending like a bow, with rocks compress'd,
  shuts out the storms; the winds and waves complain,
  and vent their malice on the cliffs in vain.
  the port lies hid within; on either side
  two tow'ring rocks the narrow mouth divide.
