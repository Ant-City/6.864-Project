ave to this sentence, apparently so
simple, a tolerably scandalous meaning.

"aramis, my good friend, this time you are wrong," interrupted porthos.
"your wit is always leading you beyond bounds; if monsieur de treville
heard you, you would repent of speaking thus."

"are you going to give me a lesson, porthos?" cried aramis, from whose
usually mild eye a flash passed like lightning.

"my dear fellow, be a musketeer or an abbe. be one or the other, but not
both," replied porthos. "you know what athos told you the other day; you
eat at everybody’s mess. ah, don’t be angry, i beg of you, that would be
useless; you know what is agreed upon between you, athos and me. you go
to madame d’aguillon’s, and you pay your court to her; you go to madame
de bois-tracy’s, the cousin of madame de chevreuse, and you pass for
being far advanced in the good graces of that lady. oh, good lord! don’t
trouble yourself to reveal your good luck; no one asks for your
secret-all the world knows your disc

retion. but since you possess that
virtue, why the devil don’t you make use of it with respect to her
majesty? let whoever likes talk of the king and the cardinal, and how he
likes; but the queen is sacred, and if anyone speaks of her, let it be
respectfully."

"porthos, you are as vain as narcissus; i plainly tell you so," replied
aramis. "you know i hate moralizing, except when it is done by athos. as
to you, good sir, you wear too magnificent a baldric to be strong on
that head. i will be an abbe if it suits me. in the meanwhile i am a
musketeer; in that quality i say what i please, and at this moment it
pleases me to say that you weary me."

"aramis!"

"porthos!"

"gentlemen! gentlemen!" cried the surrounding group.

"monsieur de treville awaits monsieur d’artagnan," cried a servant,
throwing open the door of the cabinet.

at this announcement, during which the door remained open, ev

eceiving d’artagnan’s response, the bearnese accent of which
recalled to him at the same time his youth and his country--a double
remembrance which makes a man smile at all ages; but stepping toward the
antechamber and making a sign to d’artagnan with his hand, as if to ask
his permission to finish with others before he began with him, he called
three times, with a louder voice at each time, so that he ran through
the intervening tones between the imperative accent and the angry
accent.

"athos! porthos! aramis!"

the two musketeers with whom we have already made acquaintance, and who
answered to the last of these three names, immediately quitted the group
of which they had formed a part, and advanced toward the cabinet, the
door of which closed after them as soon as they had entered. their
appearance, although it was not quite at ease, excited by its
carelessness, at once full of dignity and submission, the admiration of
d’artagnan, who beheld in these two men demigods, and in thei

but it’s all my fault; yes, it’s all my fault, because it is myself who
selects my men. you, aramis, why the devil did you ask me for a uniform
when you would have been so much better in a cassock? and you, porthos,
do you only wear such a fine golden baldric to suspend a sword of straw
from it? and athos--i don’t see athos. where is he?"

"ill--"

"very ill, say you? and of what malady?"

"it is feared that it may be the smallpox, sir," replied porthos,
desirous of taking his turn in the conversation; "and what is serious is
that it will certainly spoil his face."

"the smallpox! that’s a great story to tell me, porthos! sick of the
smallpox at his age! no, no; but wounded without doubt, killed, perhaps.

porthos and aramis trembled with rage. they could willingly have
strangled m. de treville, if, at the bottom of all this, they had not
felt it was the great love he bore them which made him speak thus. they
stamped upon the carpet with their feet; they bit their lips till the
blood came, and grasped the hilts of their swords with all their might.
all without had heard, as we have said, athos, porthos, and aramis
called, and had guessed, from m. de treville’s tone of voice, that he
was very angry about something. ten curious heads were glued to the
tapestry and became pale with fury; for their ears, closely applied to
the door, did not lose a syllable of what he said, while their mouths
repeated as he went on, the insulting expressions of the captain to all
the people in the antechamber. in an instant, from the door of the
cabinet to the street gate, the whole hotel was boiling.

xplosion; nothing was to
be heard but oaths and blasphemies. the morbleus, the sang dieus, the
morts touts les diables, crossed one another in the air. d’artagnan
looked for some tapestry behind which he might hide himself, and felt an
immense inclination to crawl under the table.

"well, my captain," said porthos, quite beside himself, "the truth is
that we were six against six. but we were not captured by fair means;
and before we had time to draw our swords, two of our party were dead,
and athos, grievously wounded, was very little better. for you know
athos. well, captain, he endeavored twice to get up, and fell again
twice. and we did not surrender--no! they dragged us away by force. on
the way we escaped. as for athos, they believed him to be dead, and left
him very quiet on the field of battle, not thinking it worth the trouble
to carry him away. that’s the whole story. what the devil, captain, one
cannot win all one’s battles! the great pompey lost that of pharsalia;

folks, nevertheless lost the battle of pavia."

"and i have the honor of assuring you that i killed one of them with his
own sword," said aramis; "for mine was broken at the first parry. killed
him, or poniarded him, sir, as is most agreeable to you."

"i did not know that," replied m. de treville, in a somewhat softened
tone. "the cardinal exaggerated, as i perceive."

"but pray, sir," continued aramis, who, seeing his captain become
appeased, ventured to risk a prayer, "do not say that athos is wounded.
he would be in despair if that should come to the ears of the king; and
as the wound is very serious, seeing that after crossing the shoulder it
penetrates into the chest, it is to be feared--"

at this instant the tapestry was raised and a noble and handsome head,
but frightfully pale, appeared under the fringe.

"athos!" cried the two musketeers.

"athos!" repeated m. de treville himself.

"you have sent for me, sir," said athos to m. de treville, in a feeble
yet perfectly calm vo

s. i am here; what do you
want with me?"

and at these words, the musketeer, in irreproachable costume, belted as
usual, with a tolerably firm step, entered the cabinet. m. de treville,
moved to the bottom of his heart by this proof of courage, sprang toward
him.

"i was about to say to these gentlemen," added he, "that i forbid my
musketeers to expose their lives needlessly; for brave men are very dear
to the king, and the king knows that his musketeers are the bravest on
the earth. your hand, athos!"

and without waiting for the answer of the newcomer to this proof of
affection, m. de treville seized his right hand and pressed it with all
his might, without perceiving that athos, whatever might be his
self-command, allowed a slight murmur of pain to escape him, and if
possible, grew paler than he was before.

the door had remained open, so strong was the excitement produced by the
arrival of athos, whose wound, though kept as a secret, was known to
all. a burst of satisfaction hailed the

last words of the captain; and
two or three heads, carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment,
appeared through the openings of the tapestry. m. de treville was about
to reprehend this breach of the rules of etiquette, when he felt the
hand of athos, who had rallied all his energies to contend against pain,
at length overcome by it, fell upon the floor as if he were dead.

"a surgeon!" cried m. de treville, "mine! the king’s! the best! a
surgeon! or, s’blood, my brave athos will die!"

at the cries of m. de treville, the whole assemblage rushed into the
cabinet, he not thinking to shut the door against anyone, and all
crowded round the wounded man. but all this eager attention might have
been useless if the doctor so loudly called for had not chanced to be in
the hotel. he pushed through the crowd, approached athos, still
insensible, and as all this noise and commotion inconvenienced him
greatly, he required, as the first and most urgent thing, that the
musketeer

treville was highly astonished to see his protege make a sudden spring,
become crimson with passion, and rush from the cabinet crying, "s’blood,
he shall not escape me this time!"

"and who?" asked m. de treville.

"he, my thief!" replied d’artagnan. "ah, the traitor!" and he
disappeared.

"the devil take the madman!" murmured m. de treville, "unless," added
he, "this is a cunning mode of escaping, seeing that he had failed in
his purpose!"




4 the shoulder of athos, the baldric of porthos and the handkerchief of
aramis


d’artagnan, in a state of fury, crossed the antechamber at three bounds,
and was darting toward the stairs, which he reckoned upon descending
four at a time, when, in his heedless course, he ran head foremost
against a musketeer who was coming out of one of m. de treville’s
private rooms, and striking his shoulder violently, made him utter a
cry, or rather a howl.

"excuse me," said d’artagnan, endeavoring to resume his course, "exc

him by the belt and stopped him.

"you are in a hurry?" said the musketeer, as pale as a sheet. "under
that pretense you run against me! you say, ’excuse me,’ and you believe
that is sufficient? not at all, my young man. do you fancy because you
have heard monsieur de treville speak to us a little cavalierly today
that other people are to treat us as he speaks to us? undeceive
yourself, comrade, you are not monsieur de treville."

"my faith!" replied d’artagnan, recognizing athos, who, after the
dressing performed by the doctor, was returning to his own apartment. "i
did not do it intentionally, and not doing it intentionally, i said
’excuse me.’ it appears to me that this is quite enough. i repeat to
you, however, and this time on my word of honor--i think perhaps too
often--that i am in haste, great haste. leave your hold, then, i beg of
you, and let me go where my business calls me."

"monsieur," said athos, letting him go, "you are not polite; it is easy
to perc

eive that you come from a distance."

d’artagnan had already strode down three or four stairs, but at athos’s
last remark he stopped short.

"morbleu, monsieur!" said he, "however far i may come, it is not you who
can give me a lesson in good manners, i warn you."

"perhaps," said athos.

"ah! if i were not in such haste, and if i were not running after
someone," said d’artagnan.

"monsieur man-in-a-hurry, you can find me without running--me, you
understand?"

"and where, i pray you?"

"near the carmes-deschaux."

"at what hour?"

"about noon."

"about noon? that will do; i will be there."

"endeavor not to make me wait; for at quarter past twelve i will cut off
your ears as you run."

"good!" cried d’artagnan, "i will be there ten minutes before twelve."
and he set off ru

ck in the morning, and yet
this morning had already brought him into disgrace with m. de treville,
who could not fail to think the manner in which d’artagnan had left him
a little cavalier.

besides this, he had drawn upon himself two good duels with two men,
each capable of killing three d’artagnans--with two musketeers, in
short, with two of those beings whom he esteemed so greatly that he
placed them in his mind and heart above all other men.

the outlook was sad. sure of being killed by athos, it may easily be
understood that the young man was not very uneasy about porthos. as
hope, however, is the last thing extinguished in the heart of man, he
finished by hoping that he might survive, even though with terrible
wounds, in both these duels; and in case of surviving, he made the
following reprehensions upon his own conduct:

"what a madcap i was, and what a stupid fellow i am! that brave and
unfortunate athos was wounded on that very shoulder against which i must
run head foremost, l

you the best place and time."

the two young men bowed and separated, aramis ascending the street which
led to the luxembourg, while d’artagnan, perceiving the appointed hour
was approaching, took the road to the carmes-deschaux, saying to
himself, "decidedly i can’t draw back; but at least, if i am killed, i
shall be killed by a musketeer."




5 the king’s musketeers and the cardinal’s guards


d’artagnan was acquainted with nobody in paris. he went therefore to his
appointment with athos without a second, determined to be satisfied with
those his adversary should choose. besides, his intention was formed to
make the brave musketeer all suitable apologies, but without meanness or
weakness, fearing that might result from this duel which generally
results from an affair of this kind, when a young and vigorous man
fights with an adversary who is wounded and weakened--if conquered, he
doubles the triumph of his antagonist; if a conqueror, he is accused of
foul play and want of coura

 the character of our adventure seeker,
or our readers must have already perceived that d’artagnan was not an
ordinary man; therefore, while repeating to himself that his death was
inevitable, he did not make up his mind to die quietly, as one less
courageous and less restrained might have done in his place. he
reflected upon the different characters of those with whom he was going
to fight, and began to view his situation more clearly. he hoped, by
means of loyal excuses, to make a friend of athos, whose lordly air and
austere bearing pleased him much. he flattered himself he should be able
to frighten porthos with the adventure of the baldric, which he might,
if not killed upon the spot, relate to everybody a recital which, well
managed, would cover porthos with ridicule. as to the astute aramis, he
did not entertain much dread of him; and supposing he should be able to
get so far, he determined to dispatch him in good style or at least, by
hitting him in the face, as caesar recommended

 anyone but the king, the cardinal, and monsieur de
treville." he flew, then, rather than walked, toward the convent of the
carmes dechausses, or rather deschaux, as it was called at that period,
a sort of building without a window, surrounded by barren fields--an
accessory to the preaux-clercs, and which was generally employed as the
place for the duels of men who had no time to lose.

when d’artagnan arrived in sight of the bare spot of ground which
extended along the foot of the monastery, athos had been waiting about
five minutes, and twelve o’clock was striking. he was, then, as punctual
as the samaritan woman, and the most rigorous casuist with regard to
duels could have nothing to say.

athos, who still suffered grievously from his wound, though it had been
dressed anew by m. de treville’s surgeon, was seated on a post and
waiting for his adversary with hat in hand, his feather even touching
the ground.

"monsieur," said athos, "i have engaged two of my friends as seconds;
but 
 
 ___________________________
 
these two friends are not yet come, at which i am astonished, as it
is not at all their custom."

"i have no seconds on my part, monsieur," said d’artagnan; "for having
only arrived yesterday in paris, i as yet know no one but monsieur de
treville, to whom i was recommended by my father, who has the honor to
be, in some degree, one of his friends."

athos reflected for an instant. "you know no one but monsieur de
treville?" he asked.

"yes, monsieur, i know only him."

"well, but then," continued athos, speaking half to himself, "if i kill
you, i shall have the air of a boy-slayer."

"not too much so," replied d’artagnan, with a bow that was not deficient
in dignity, "since you do me the honor to draw a sword with me while
suffering from a wound which is very inconvenient."

"very inconvenient, upon my word; and you hurt me devilishly, i can t

you. but i will take the left hand--it is my custom in such
circumstances. do not fancy that i do you a favor; i use either hand
easily. and it will be even a disadvantage to you; a left-handed man is
very troublesome to people who are not prepared for it. i regret i did
not inform you sooner of this circumstance."

"you have truly, monsieur," said d’artagnan, bowing again, "a courtesy,
for which, i assure you, i am very grateful."

"you confuse me," replied athos, with his gentlemanly air; "let us talk
of something else, if you please. ah, s’blood, how you have hurt me! my
shoulder quite burns."

"if you would permit me--" said d’artagnan, with timidity.

"what, monsieur?"

"i have a miraculous balsam for wounds--a balsam given to me by my
mother and of which i have made a trial upon myself."

"well?"

"well, i am sure that in less than three days this balsam would cure
you; and at the end of three days, when you would be cured--well, sir,
it would

still do me a great honor to be your man."

d’artagnan spoke these words with a simplicity that did honor to his
courtesy, without throwing the least doubt upon his courage.

"pardieu, monsieur!" said athos, "that’s a proposition that pleases me;
not that i can accept it, but a league off it savors of the gentleman.
thus spoke and acted the gallant knights of the time of charlemagne, in
whom every cavalier ought to seek his model. unfortunately, we do not
live in the times of the great emperor, we live in the times of the
cardinal; and three days hence, however well the secret might be
guarded, it would be known, i say, that we were to fight, and our combat
would be prevented. i think these fell

ows will never come."

"if you are in haste, monsieur," said d’artagnan, with the same
simplicity with which a moment before he had proposed to him to put off
the duel for three days, "and if it be your will to dispatch me at once,
do not inconvenience yourself, i pray you."

"there is another word which pleases me," cried athos, with a gracious
nod to d’artagnan. "that did not come from a man without a heart.
monsieur, i love men of your kidney; and i foresee plainly that if we
don’t kill each other, i shall hereafter have much pleasure in your
conversation. we will wait for these gentlemen, so please you; i have
plenty of time, and it will be more correct. ah, here is one of them, i
believe."

in fact, at the end of the rue vaugirard the gigantic porthos appeared.

"what!" cried d’artagnan, "is your first witne

ss monsieur porthos?"

"yes, that disturbs you?"

"by no means."

"and here is the second."

d’artagnan turned in the direction pointed to by athos, and perceived
aramis.

"what!" cried he, in an accent of greater astonishment than before,
"your second witness is monsieur aramis?"

"doubtless! are you not aware that we are never seen one without the
others, and that we are called among the musketeers and the guards, at
court and in the city, athos, porthos, and aramis, or the three
inseparables? and yet, as you come from dax or pau--"

"from tarbes," said d’artagnan.

"it is probable you are ignorant of this little fact," said athos.

"my faith!" replied d’artagnan, "you are well named, gentlemen; and my
adventure, if it should make any noise, will prove at least that your
union is not founded upon contrasts."

in the meantime, porthos had come up, waved his hand to athos, and then
turning toward d’artagnan, stood quite astonished.

let us say in passing that he had changed his baldric and relinquished
his cloak.

"ah, ah!" said he, "what does this mean?"

"this is the gentleman i am going to fight with," said athos, pointing
to d’artagnan with his hand and saluting him with the same gesture.

"why, it is with him i am also going to fight," said porthos.

"but not before one o’clock," replied d’artagnan.

"and i also am to fight with this gentleman," said aramis, coming in his
turn onto the place.

"but not until two o’clock," said d’artagnan, with the same calmness.

"but what are you going to fight about, athos?" asked aramis.

"faith! i don’t very well know. he hurt my shoulder. and you, por

thos?"

"faith! i am going to fight--because i am going to fight," answered
porthos, reddening.

athos, whose keen eye lost nothing, perceived a faintly sly smile pass
over the lips of the young gascon as he replied, "we had a short
discussion upon dress."

"and you, aramis?" asked athos.

"oh, ours is a theological quarrel," replied aramis, making a sign to
d’artagnan to keep secret the cause of their duel.

athos indeed saw a second smile on the lips of d’artagnan.

"indeed?" said athos.

"yes; a passage of st. augustine, upon which we could not agree," said
the gascon.

"decidedly, this is a clever fellow," murmured athos.

"and now you are assembled, gentlemen," said d’artagnan, "permit me to
offer you my apologies."

at this word apologies, a cloud passed over the brow of athos, a haughty
smile curled the lip of porthos, and a negative sign was the reply of
aramis.

"you do not understand me, gentlemen," said d’artagnan, throwing up his
head, the sharp and bold lines of

 which were at the moment gilded by a
bright ray of the sun. "i asked to be excused in case i should not be
able to discharge my debt to all three; for monsieur athos has the right
to kill me first, which must much diminish the face-value of your bill,
monsieur porthos, and render yours almost null, monsieur aramis. and
now, gentlemen, i repeat, excuse me, but on that account only, and--on
guard!"

at these words, with the most gallant air possible, d’artagnan drew his
sword.

the blood had mounted to the head of d’artagnan, and at that moment he
would have drawn his sword against all the musketeers in the kingdom as
willingly as he now did against athos

, porthos, and aramis.

it was a quarter past midday. the sun was in its zenith, and the spot
chosen for the scene of the duel was exposed to its full ardor.

"it is very hot," said athos, drawing his sword in its turn, "and yet i
cannot take off my doublet; for i just now felt my wound begin to bleed
again, and i should not like to annoy monsieur with the sight of blood
which he has not drawn from me himself."

"that is true, monsieur," replied d’artagnan, "and whether drawn by
myself or another, i assure you i shall always view with regret the
blood of so brave a gentleman. i will therefore fight in my doublet,
like yourself."

"come, come, enough of such compliments!" cried

 porthos. "remember, we
are waiting for our turns."

"speak for yourself when you are inclined to utter such incongruities,"
interrupted aramis. "for my part, i think what they say is very well
said, and quite worthy of two gentlemen."

"when you please, monsieur," said athos, putting himself on guard.

"i waited your orders," said d’artagnan, crossing swords.

but scarcely had the two rapiers clashed, when a company of the guards
of his eminence, commanded by m. de jussac, turned the corner of the
convent.

"the cardinal’s guards!" cried aramis and porthos at the same time.
"sheathe your swords, gentlemen, sheathe your swords!"

but it was too late. the two combatants had been seen in a position
which left no doubt of their intentions.

"halloo!" cried jussac, 
 
 ___________________________
 
advancing toward them and making a sign to his
men to do so likewise, "halloo, musketeers? fighting here, are you? and
the edicts? what is become of them?"

"you are very generous, gentlemen of the guards," said athos, full of
rancor, for jussac was one of the aggressors of the preceding day. "if
we were to see you fighting, i can assure you that we would make no
effort to prevent you. leave us alone, then, and you will enjoy a little
amusement without cost to yourselves."

"gentlemen," said jussac, "it is with great regret that i pronounce the
thing impossible. duty before everything. sheathe, then, if you please,
and follow us."

"monsieur," said aramis, parodying jussac, "it would afford us great
pleasure
 
 ___________________________
 
 to obey your polite invitation if it depended upon ourselves;
but unfortunately the thing is impossible--monsieur de treville has
forbidden it. pass on your way, then; it is the best thing to do."

this raillery exasperated jussac. "we will charge upon you, then," said
he, "if you disobey."

"there are five of them," said athos, half aloud, "and we are but three;
we shall be beaten again, and must die on the spot, for, on my part, i
declare i will never appear again before the captain as a conquered
man."

athos, porthos, and aramis instantly drew near one another, while jussac
drew up his soldiers.

this short interval was sufficient to determine d’artagnan on the part
he was to take. it was one of those events which decide the life of a
man; it was a choice between the king and the cardinal--the choice made,

st be persisted in. to fight, that was to disobey the law, that was
to risk his head, that was to make at one blow an enemy of a minister
more powerful than the king himself. all this the young man perceived,
and yet, to his praise we speak it, he did not hesitate a second.
turning towards athos and his friends, "gentlemen," said he, "allow me
to correct your words, if you please. you said you were but three, but
it appears to me we are four."

"but you are not one of us," said porthos.

"that’s true," replied d’artagnan; "i have not the uniform, but i have
the spirit. my heart is that of a musketeer; i feel it, monsieur, and
that impels me on."

"withdraw, young man," cried jussac, who doubtless, by his gestures and
the expression of his countenance, had guessed d’artagnan’s d

esign. "you
may retire; we consent to that. save your skin; begone quickly."

d’artagnan did not budge.

"decidedly, you are a brave fellow," said athos, pressing the young
man’s hand.

"come, come, choose your part," replied jussac.

"well," said porthos to aramis, "we must do something."

"monsieur is full of generosity," said athos.

but all three reflected upon the youth of d’artagnan, and dreaded his
inexperience.

"we should only be three, one of whom is wounded, with the addition of a
boy," resumed athos; "and yet it will not be the less said we were four
men."

"yes, but to yield!" said porthos.

"that is difficult," replied athos.

d’artagnan comprehended their irresolution.

"try me, gentlemen," said he, "and i swear to you by my honor that i
will not go hence if we are conquered."

"what is your name, my brave
 
 ___________________________
 
 fellow?" said athos.

"d’artagnan, monsieur."

"well, then, athos, porthos, aramis, and d’artagnan, forward!" cried
athos.

"come, gentlemen, have you decided?" cried jussac for the third time.

"it is done, gentlemen," said athos.

"and what is your choice?" asked jussac.

"we are about to have the honor of charging you," replied aramis,
lifting his hat with one hand and drawing his sword with the other.

"ah! you resist, do you?" cried jussac.

"s’blood; does that astonish you?"

and the nine combatants rushed upon each other with a fury which however
did not exclude a certain degree of method.

athos fixed upon a certain cahusac, a favorite of the cardinal’s.
porthos had bicarat, and aramis found himself opposed t
 
 ___________________________
 
his sword through his body.
jussac fell like a dead mass.

d’artagnan then cast an anxious and rapid glance over the field of
battle.

aramis had killed one of his adversaries, but the other pressed him
warmly. nevertheless, aramis was in a good situation, and able to defend
himself.

bicarat and porthos had just made counterhits. porthos had received a
thrust through his arm, and bicarat one through his thigh. but neither
of these two wounds was serious, and they only fought more earnestly.

athos, wounded anew by cahusac, became evidently paler, but did not give
way a foot. he only changed his sword hand, and fought with his left
hand.

according to the laws of dueling at that period, d’artagnan was at
liberty to assist whom he pleased. while he was endeavoring to find out

ance. d’artagnan interpreted it; with a terrible bound he sprang
to the side of cahusac, crying, "to me, monsieur guardsman; i will slay
you!"

cahusac turned. it was time; for athos, whose great courage alone
supported him, sank upon his knee.

"s’blood!" cried he to d’artagnan, "do not kill him, young man, i beg of
you. i have an old affair to settle with him when i am cured and sound
again. disarm him only--make sure of his sword. that’s it! very well
done!"

the exclamation was drawn from athos by seeing the sword of cahusac fly
twenty paces from him. d’artagnan and cahusac sprang forward at the same
instant, the one to recover, the other to obtain, the sword; b

d’artagnan, being the more active, reached it first and placed his foot
upon it.

cahusac immediately ran to the guardsman whom aramis had killed, seized
his rapier, and returned toward d’artagnan; but on his way he met athos,
who during his relief which d’artagnan had procured him had recovered
his breath, and who, for fear that d’artagnan would kill his enemy,
wished to resume the fight.

d’artagnan perceived that it would be disobliging athos not to leave him
alone; and in a few minutes cahusac fell, with a sword thrust through
his throat.

at the same instant aramis placed his sword point on the breast of his
fallen enemy, and forced him to ask for mercy.

there only then remained porthos and bicarat. porthos made a thousand
flourishes, asking bicarat what o’clock it could be, and offering him
his compliments upon his brother’s having just obtained a company in the
regiment of navarre; but, jest as he might, he gained nothing.

was one of those iron men who never fell dead.

nevertheless, it was necessary to finish. the watch might come up and
take all the combatants, wounded or not, royalists or cardinalists.
athos, aramis, and d’artagnan surrounded bicarat, and required him to
surrender. though alone against all and with a wound in his thigh,
bicarat wished to hold out; but jussac, who had risen upon his elbow,
cried out to him to yield. bicarat was a gascon, as d’artagnan was; he
turned a deaf ear, and contented himself with laughing, and between two
parries finding time to point to a spot of earth with his sword, "here,"
cried he, parodying a verse of the bible, "here will bicarat die; for i

said, was dead. they then rang the bell, and carrying away four swords
out of five, they took their road, intoxicated with joy, toward the
hotel of m. de treville.

they walked arm in arm, occupying the whole width of the street and
taking in every musketeer they met, so that in the end it became a
triumphal march. the heart of d’artagnan swam in delirium; he marched
between athos and porthos, pressing them tenderly.

"if i am not yet a musketeer," said he to his new friends, as he passed
through the gateway of m. de treville’s hotel, "at least i have entered
upon my apprenticeship, haven’t i?"

this affair made a great noise. m. de treville scolded his musketeers in
public, and congratulated them in private; but as no time was to be lost
in gaining the king, m. de treville hastened to report himself at the
louvre. it was already to

"yes, sire, as they always do."

"and how did the thing happen? let us see, for you know, my dear
captain, a judge must hear both sides."

"good lord! in the most simple and natural manner possible. three of my
best soldiers, whom your majesty knows by name, and whose devotedness
you have more than once appreciated, and who have, i dare affirm to the
king, his service much at heart--three of my best soldiers, i say,
athos, porthos, and aramis, had made a party of pleasure with a young
fellow from gascony, whom i had introduced to them the same morning. the
party was to take place at st. germain, i believe, and they had
appointed to meet at the carmes-deschaux, when they were disturbed by de
jussac, cahusac, bicarat, and two other guardsmen, who certainly did not
go there in such a numerous company without some ill intention against
the edicts."

"ah, ah! you incline me to think so," said the king. "there is no d

t as it was indeed something to have prevailed upon
this child to rebel against his master, he saluted the king
respectfully, and with this agreement, took leave of him.

that evening the three musketeers were informed of the honor accorded
them. as they had long been acquainted with the king, they were not much
excited; but d’artagnan, with his gascon imagination, saw in it his
future fortune, and passed the night in golden dreams. by eight o’clock
in the morning he was at the apartment of athos.

d’artagnan found the musketeer dressed and ready to go out. as the hour
to wait upon the king was not till twelve, he had made a party with
porthos and aramis to play a game at tennis in a tennis court situated
near the stables of the luxembourg. athos invited d’artagnan to follow
them; and although ignorant of the game, which he had never played, he
accepted, not knowing what to do with his time from nine o’clock in the
morning, as it then scarcely was, till twelve.

 were already there, and were playing together. athos,
who was very expert in all bodily exercises, passed with d’artagnan to
the opposite side and challenged them; but at the first effort he made,
although he played with his left hand, he found that his wound was yet
too recent to allow of such exertion. d’artagnan remained, therefore,
alone; and as he declared he was too ignorant of the game to play it
regularly they only continued giving balls to one another without
counting. but one of these balls, launched by porthos’ herculean hand,

rved that we go out
together. you must be aware that for our undertaking, company would be

"that’s true," said the guardsman, astonished that his name had not
produced more effect upon the young man.

indeed, the name of bernajoux was known to all the world, d’artagnan
alone excepted, perhaps; for it was one of those which figured most
frequently in the daily brawls which all the edicts of the cardinal
could not repress.

porthos and aramis were so engaged with their game, and athos was
watching them with so much attention, that they did not even perceive
their young companion go out, who, as he had told the guardsman of his
eminence, stopped outside the door. an instant after, the guardsman
descended in his turn. as d’artagnan had no time to lose, on account of
the audience of the king, which was fixed for midday, he cast his eyes
around, and seeing that the street was empty, said to his adversary, "my
faith! it is fortunate for you, although your name is bernajoux, to

of m. de la tremouille, in whose service he had a
relative, d’artagnan was ignorant of the seriousness of the last wound
his adversary had received, and pressing him warmly, without doubt would
soon have completed his work with a third blow, when the noise which
arose from the street being heard in the tennis court, two of the
friends of the guardsman, who had seen him go out after exchanging some
words with d’artagnan, rushed, sword in hand, from the court, and fell
upon the conqueror. but athos, porthos, and aramis quickly appeared in
their turn, and the moment the two guardsmen attacked their young
companion, drove them back. bernajoux now fell, and as the guardsmen
were only two against four, they began to cry, "to the rescue! the hotel
de la tremouille!" at these cries, all who were in the hotel rushed out
and fell upon the four companions, who on their side cried aloud, "to
the rescue, musketeers!"

this cry was generally heeded; for the musketeers were known to be

nce, took leave of m. de la tremouille, returned to his hotel,
and immediately sent word to the four friends that he awaited their
company at dinner.

m de treville entertained good company, wholly anticardinalist, though.
it may easily be understood, therefore, that the conversation during the
whole of dinner turned upon the two checks that his eminence’s guardsmen
had received. now, as d’artagnan had been the hero of these two fights,
it was upon him that all the felicitations fell, which athos, porthos,
and aramis abandoned to him, not only as good comrades, but as men who
had so often had their turn that they could very well afford him his.

toward six o’clock m. de treville announced that it was time to go to
the louvre; but as the hour of audience granted by his majesty was past,
instead of claiming the entree by the back stairs, he placed himself
with the four young men in the antechamber. the king had not yet
returned from hunting. our young men had been waiting about half an

ots, and holding a whip in his hand. at the
first glance, d’artagnan judged that the mind of the king was stormy.

this disposition, visible as it was in his majesty, did not prevent the
courtiers from ranging themselves along his pathway. in royal
antechambers it is worth more to be viewed with an angry eye than not to
be seen at all. the three musketeers therefore did not hesitate to make
a step forward. d’artagnan on the contrary remained concealed behind
them; but although the king knew athos, porthos, and aramis personally,
he passed before them without speaking or looking--indeed, as if he had
never seen them before. as for m. de treville, when the eyes of the king
fell upon him, he sustained the look with so much firmness that it was
the king who dropped his eyes; after which his majesty, grumbling,
entered his apartment.

"matters go but badly," said athos, smiling; "and we shall not be made
chevaliers of the order this time."

"wait here ten minutes," said m. de treville; "and

"sire," replied m. de treville, calmly, "on the contrary, i come to
demand it of you."

"and against whom?" cried the king.

"against calumniators," said m. de treville.

"ah! this is something new," replied the king. "will you tell me that
your three damned musketeers, athos, porthos, and aramis, and your
youngster from bearn, have not fallen, like so many furies, upon poor
bernajoux, and have not maltreated him in such a fashion that probably
by this time he is dead? will you tell me that they did not lay siege to
the hotel of the duc de la tremouille, and that they did not endeavor to

d’artagnan, who understood that it was to him this compliment was
addressed, approached, assuming a most deprecating air.

"why, you told me he was a young man? this is a boy, treville, a mere
boy! do you mean to say that it was he who bestowed that severe thrust
at jussac?"

"and those two equally fine thrusts at bernajoux."

"truly!"

"without reckoning," said athos, "that if he had not rescued me from the
hands of cahusac, i should not now have the honor of making my very
humble reverence to your majesty."

"why he is a very devil, this bearnais! ventre-saint-gris, monsieur de
treville, as the king my father would have said. but at this sort of
work, many doublets must be slashed and many swords broken. now, gascons

this did not prevent the king from being as complacent to him as
possible whenever he met him, or from asking in the kindest tone, "well,
monsieur cardinal, how fares it with that poor jussac and that poor
bernajoux of yours?"




7 the interior* of the musketeers


when d’artagnan was out of the louvre, and consulted his friends upon
the use he had best make of his share of the forty pistoles, athos
advised him to order a good repast at the pomme-de-pin, porthos to
engage a lackey, and aramis to provide himself with a suitable mistress.

_*domestic affairs, housekeeping_

the repast was carried into effect that very day, and the lackey waited
at table. the repast had been ordered by athos, and the lackey furnished
by porthos. he was a picard, whom the glorious musketeer had picked up
on the bridge tournelle, making rings and plashing in the water.

porthos pretended that this occupation wa

r having
thrown him into the service of such a croesus. he preserved this opinion
even after the feast, with the remnants of which he repaired his own
long abstinence; but when in the evening he made his master’s bed, the
chimeras of planchet faded away. the bed was the only one in the
apartment, which consisted of an antechamber and a bedroom. planchet
slept in the antechamber upon a coverlet taken from the bed of
d’artagnan, and which d’artagnan from that time made shift to do
without.

athos, on his part, had a valet whom he had trained in his service in a
thoroughly peculiar fashion, and who was named grimaud. he was very
taciturn, this worthy signor. be it understood we are speaking of athos.
during the five or six years that he had lived in the strictest intimacy
with his companions, porthos and aramis, they could remember having
often seen him smile, but had never heard him laugh. his words were
brief and expressive, conveying all that was meant, and no more; no
embellishments,
 
 ___________________________
 
 no embroidery, no arabesques. his conversation was a
matter of fact, without a single romance.

although athos was scarcely thirty years old, and was of great personal
beauty and intelligence of mind, no one knew whether he had ever had a
mistress. he never spoke of women. he certainly did not prevent others
from speaking of them before him, although it was easy to perceive that
this kind of conversation, in which he only mingled by bitter words and
misanthropic remarks, was very disagreeable to him. his reserve, his
roughness, and his silence made almost an old man of him. he had, then,
in order not to
 
 ___________________________
 
 disturb his habits, accustomed grimaud to obey him upon
a simple gesture or upon a simple movement of his lips. he never spoke
to him, except under the most extraordinary occasions.

sometimes, grimaud, who feared his master as he did fire, while
entertaining a strong attachment to his person and a great veneration
for his talents, believed he perfectly understood what he wanted, flew
to execute the order received, and did precisely the contrary. athos
then shrugged his shoulders, and, without putting himself in a passion,
thrashed grimaud. on these days he spoke a little.

porthos, as we have seen, had a character exactly opposite to that of
athos. he not only talked much, but he talked loudly, little caring, we
must render him that justice, whether anybody listened to him or not. he
talked for the pleasure of talking and for the pleasure of hearing
himself talk. he spoke upon all subjects except the sciences, alleging
in this respect the in
 
 ___________________________
 
veterate hatred he had borne to scholars from his
childhood. he had not so noble an air as athos, and the commencement of
their intimacy often rendered him unjust toward that gentleman, whom he
endeavored to eclipse by his splendid dress. but with his simple
musketeer’s uniform and nothing but the manner in which he threw back
his head and advanced his foot, athos instantly took the place which was
his due and consigned the ostentatious porthos to the second rank.
porthos consoled himself by filling the antechamber of m. de treville
and the guardroom of the louvre with the accounts of his love scrapes,
after having passed from professional ladies to military ladies, from
the lawyer’s dame to the baroness, there was question of nothing less
with porthos than a foreign princess, who was enormously fond of him.

an old proverb says, "like master, like man

." let us pass, then, from
the valet of athos to the valet of porthos, from grimaud to mousqueton.

mousqueton was a norman, whose pacific name of boniface his master had
changed into the infinitely more sonorous name of mousqueton. he had
entered the service of porthos upon condition that he should only be
clothed and lodged, though in a handsome manner; but he claimed two
hours a day to himself, consecrated to an employment which would provide
for his other wants. porthos agreed to the bargain; the thing suited him
wonderfully well. he h

ys clothed in black, as became the servant of a
churchman. he was a berrichon, thirty-five or forty years old, mild,
peaceable, sleek, employing the leisure his master left him in the
perusal of pious works, providing rigorously for two a dinner of few
dishes, but excellent. for the rest, he was dumb, blind, and deaf, and
of unimpeachable fidelity.

and now that we are acquainted, superficially at least, with the masters
and the valets, let us pass on to the dwellings occupied by each of
them.

athos dwelt in the rue ferou, within two steps of the luxembourg. his
apartment consisted of two small chambers, very nicely fitted up, in a
furnished house, the hostess of which, still young and still really
handsome, cast tender glances uselessly at him. some fragments of past
splendor appeared here and there upon the walls of this modest lodging;
a sword, for example, richly embossed, which belonged by its make to the
times of francis i, the hilt of which alone, encrusted with precious
stones, mig

ht be worth two hundred pistoles, and which, nevertheless, in
his moments of greatest distress athos had never pledged or offered for
sale. it had long been an object of ambition for porthos. porthos would
have given ten years of his life to possess this sword.

one day, when he had an appointment with a duchess, he endeavored even
to borrow it of athos. athos, without saying anything, emptied his
pockets, got together all his jewels, purses, aiguillettes, and gold
chains, and offered them all to porthos; but as to the sword, he said it
was sealed to its place and should never quit it until its master should
himself quit his lodgings. in addition to the sword, there was a
portrait representing a nobleman of the time of henry iii, dressed with
the greatest elegance, and who wore the order of the holy ghost; and
this portrait had certain resemblances o
 
 ___________________________
 
f lines with athos, certain
family likenesses which indicated that this great noble, a knight of the
order of the king, was his ancestor.

besides these, a casket of magnificent goldwork, with the same arms as
the sword and the portrait, formed a middle ornament to the mantelpiece,
and assorted badly with the rest of the furniture. athos always carried
the key of this coffer about him; but he one day opened it before
porthos, and porthos was convinced that this coffer contained nothing
but letters and papers--love letters and family papers, no doubt.

porthos lived in an apartment, large in size and of very sumptuous
appearance, in the rue du vieux-colombier. every time he passed with a
friend before his windows, at one of which mousqueton was sure to be
placed in full livery, porthos raised his head and his hand, and said,

 little lodging composed of a boudoir, an
eating room, and a bedroom, which room, situated, as the others were, on
the ground floor, looked out upon a little fresh green garden, shady and
impenetrable to the eyes of his neighbors.

with regard to d’artagnan, we know how he was lodged, and we have
already made acquaintance with his lackey, master planchet.

d’artagnan, who was by nature very curious--as people generally are who
possess the genius of intrigue--did all he could to make out who athos,
porthos, and aramis really were (for under these pseudonyms each of
these young men concealed his family name)--athos in particular, who, a
league away, savored of nobility. he addressed himself then to porthos
to gain information respecting athos and aramis, and to aramis in order
to learn something of porthos.

unfortunately porthos knew nothing of the life of his silent companion
but what revealed itself. it was said athos had met with great crosses
in love, and that a frightful treachery h

y, but assumed the most modest air and
replied in a friendly tone, "my dear friend, do not forget that i wish
to belong to the church, and that i avoid all mundane opportunities. the
handkerchief you saw had not been given to me, but it had been forgotten
and left at my house by one of my friends. i was obliged to pick it up
in order not to compromise him and the lady he loves. as for myself, i
neither have, nor desire to have, a mistress, following in that respect
the very judicious example of athos, who has none any more than i have."

"but what the devil! you are not a priest, you are a musketeer!"

"a musketeer for a time, my friend, as the cardinal says, a musketeer
against my will, but a churchman at heart, believe me. athos and porthos
dragged me into this to occupy me. i had, at the moment of being
ordained, a little difficulty with--but that would not interest you, and
i am taking up your valuable time."

"not at all; it interests me very much," cried d’artagnan; "and at this
mom

. so you see, my dear friend, that if you are not in a hurry, i
am very much in a hurry."

aramis held out his hand in a cordial manner to his young companion, and
took leave of him.

notwithstanding all the pains he took, d’artagnan was unable to learn
any more concerning his three new-made friends. he formed, therefore,
the resolution of believing for the present all that was said of their
past, hoping for more certain and extended revelations in the future. in
the meanwhile, he looked upon athos as an achilles, porthos as an ajax,
and aramis as a joseph.

as to the rest, the life of the four young friends was joyous enough.
athos played, and that as a rule unfortunately. nevertheless, he never
borrowed a sou of his companions, although his purse was ever at their
service; and when he had played upon honor, he always awakened his
creditor by six o’clock the next morning to pay the debt of the
preceding evening.

porthos had his fits. on the days when he won he was insolent and
ostenta

e. he had always something or other to
do. sometimes in the midst of dinner, when everyone, under the
attraction of wine and in the warmth of conversation, believed they had
two or three hours longer to enjoy themselves at table, aramis looked at
his watch, arose with a bland smile, and took leave of the company, to
go, as he said, to consult a casuist with whom he had an appointment. at
other times he would return home to write a treatise, and requested his
friends not to disturb him.

at this athos would smile, with his charming, melancholy smile, which so
became his noble countenance, and porthos would drink, swearing that
aramis would never be anything but a village cure.

planchet, d’artagnan’s valet, supported his good fortune nobly. he
received thirty sous per day, and for a month he returned to his
lodgings gay as a chaffinch, and affable toward his master. when the
wind of adversity began to blow upon the housekeeping of the rue des
fossoyeurs--that is to say, when the forty pi

stoles of king louis xiii
were consumed or nearly so--he commenced complaints which athos thought
nauseous, porthos indecent, and aramis ridiculous. athos counseled
d’artagnan to dismiss the fellow; porthos was of the opinion that he
should give him a good thrashing first; and aramis contended that a
master should never attend to anything but the civilities paid to him.

"this is all very easy for you to say," replied d’artagnan, "for you,
athos, who live like a dumb man with grimaud, who forbid him to speak,
and consequently never exchange ill words with him; for you, porthos,
who carry matters in such a magnificent style, and are a god to your
valet, mousqueton; and for you, aramis, who, always abstracted by your
theological studies, inspire your servant, bazin, a mild, religious man,
with a profound respect; but for me, who am without any settled means
and without resources--for me, who am neither a musketeer nor even a
guardsman, w

with a sigh,
donned his uniform, which he would have exchanged for that of a
musketeer at the expense of ten years of his existence. but m. de
treville promised this favor after a novitiate of two years--a novitiate
which might besides be abridged if an opportunity should present itself
for d’artagnan to render the king any signal service, or to distinguish
himself by some brilliant action. upon this promise d’artagnan withdrew,
and the next day he began service.

then it became the turn of athos, porthos, and aramis to mount guard
with d’artagnan when he was on duty. the company of m. le chevalier
dessessart thus received four instead of one when it admitted
d’artagnan.




8 concerning a court intrigue


in the meantime, the forty pistoles of king louis xiii, like all other
things of this world, after having had a beginning had an end, and after
this end our four companions began to be somewhat embarrassed. at first,
athos supported the association for a time with his own means.

orthos went to the gaming table. unfortunately he was in a bad vein; he
lost all, together with twenty-five pistoles for which he had given his
word.

then the inconvenience became distress. the hungry friends, followed by
their lackeys, were seen haunting the quays and guard rooms, picking up
among their friends abroad all the dinners they could meet with; for
according to the advice of aramis, it was prudent to sow repasts right
and left in prosperity, in order to reap a few in time of need.

athos was invited four times, and each time took his friends and their
lackeys with him. porthos had six occasions, and contrived in the same
manner that his friends should partake of them; aramis had eight of
them. he was a man, as must have been already perceived, who made but
little noise, and yet was much sought after.

as to d’artagnan, who as yet knew nobody in the capital, he only found
one chocolate breakfast at the house of a priest of his own province,
and one dinner at the house of a cor

net of the guards. he took his army
to the priest’s, where they devoured as much provision as would have
lasted him for two months, and to the cornet’s, who performed wonders;
but as planchet said, "people do not eat at once for all time, even when
they eat a good deal."

d’artagnan thus felt himself humiliated in having only procured one meal
and a half for his companions--as the breakfast at the priest’s could
only be counted as half a repast--in return for the feasts which athos,
porthos, and aramis had procured him. he fancied himself a burden to the
society, forgetting in his perfectly juvenile good faith that he had fed
this society for a month; and he set his mind actively to work. he
reflected that this coalition of four young, brave, enterprising, and
active men ought to have some other object than swaggering walks,
fencing lessons, and practical jokes, more or less witty.

in fact, four men such as they were--four men devoted to one another,

understand, monsieur--but!--" cried the citizen.

"what!" demanded d’artagnan.

"whom do i see yonder?"

"where?"

"in the street, facing your window, in the embrasure of that door--a man
wrapped in a cloak."

"it is he!" cried d’artagnan and the citizen at the same time, each
having recognized his man.

"ah, this time," cried d’artagnan, springing to his sword, "this time he
will not escape me!"

drawing his sword from its scabbard, he rushed out of the apartment. on
the staircase he met athos and porthos, who were coming to see him. they
separated, and d’artagnan rushed between them like a dart.

"pah! where are you going?" cried the two musketeers in a breath.

"the man of meung!" replied d’artagnan, and disappeared.

d’artagnan had more than once related to his friends his adventure with
the stranger, as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner, to
whom this man had confided some important missive.

the opinion of athos was that d’artagnan had lost his letter in t

ed from d’artagnan,
what affair was in hand, and as they thought that overtaking his man, or
losing sight of him, d’artagnan would return to his rooms, they kept on
their way.

when they entered d’artagnan’s chamber, it was empty; the landlord,
dreading the consequences of the encounter which was doubtless about to
take place between the young man and the stranger, had, consistent with
the character he had given himself, judged it prudent to decamp.




9 d’artagnan shows himself


as athos and porthos had foreseen, at the expiration of a half hour,
d’artagnan returned. he had again missed his man, who had disappeared as
if by enchantment. d’artagnan had run, sword in hand, through all the
neighboring streets, but had found nobody resembling the man he sought
for. then he came back to the point where, perhaps, he ought to have
begun, and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had
leaned; but this proved useless--for though he knocked ten or twelve
times in su

aramis had joined his companions; so that on returning home d’artagnan
found the reunion complete.

enter with his brow covered with perspiration and his countenance upset
with anger.

"well!" cried he, throwing his sword upon the bed, "this man must be the
devil in person; he has disappeared like a phantom, like a shade, like a
specter."

"do you believe in apparitions?" asked athos of porthos.

"i never believe in anything i have not seen, and as i never have seen
apparitions, i don’t believe in them."

"the bible," said aramis, "makes our belief in them a law; the ghost of
samuel appeared to saul, and it is an article of faith that i should be
very sorry to see any doubt thrown upon, porthos."

"at all events, man or devil, body or shadow, illusion or reality, this
man is born for my damnation; for his flight has caused us to miss a
glorious affair, gentlemen--an affai

r by which there were a hundred
pistoles, and perhaps more, to be gained."

"how is that?" cried porthos and aramis in a breath.

as to athos, faithful to his system of reticence, he contented himself
with interrogating d’artagnan by a look.

"planchet," said d’artagnan to his domestic, who just then insinuated
his head through the half-open door in order to catch some fragments of
the conversation, "go down to my landlord, monsieur bonacieux, and ask
him to send me half a dozen bottles of beaugency wine; i prefer that."

"ah, ah! you have credit with your landlord, then?" asked porthos.

"yes," replied d’artagnan, "from this v

ery day; and mind, if the wine is
bad, we will send him to find better."

"we must use, and not abuse," said aramis, sententiously.

"i always said that d’artagnan had the longest head of the four," said
athos, who, having uttered his opinion, to which d’artagnan replied with
a bow, immediately resumed his accustomed silence.

"but come, what is this about?" asked porthos.

"yes," said aramis, "impart it to us, my dear friend, unless the honor
of any lady be hazarded by this confidence; in that case you would do
better to keep it to yourself."

"be satisfied," replied d’artagnan; "the honor of no one will have cause
to complain of what i have to tell."

he then related to his friends, word for wo

rd, all that had passed
between him and his host, and how the man who had abducted the wife of
his worthy landlord was the same with whom he had had the difference at
the hostelry of the jolly miller.

"your affair is not bad," said athos, after having tasted like a
connoisseur and indicated by a nod of his head that he thought the wine
good; "and one may draw fifty or sixty pistoles from this good man. then
there only remains to ascertain whether these fifty or sixty pistoles
are worth the risk of four heads."

"but observe," cried d’artagnan, "that there is a woman in the affair--a
woman carried off, a woman who is doubtless threatened, tortured
perhaps, and all because she is faithful to her mistress."

"beware, d’artagna
 
 ___________________________
 
n, beware," said aramis. "you grow a little too warm,
in my opinion, about the fate of madame bonacieux. woman was created for
our destruction, and it is from her we inherit all our miseries."

at this speech of aramis, the brow of athos became clouded and he bit
his lips.

"it is not madame bonacieux about whom i am anxious," cried d’artagnan,
"but the queen, whom the king abandons, whom the cardinal persecutes,
and who sees the heads of all her friends fall, one after the other."

"why does she love what we hate most in the world, the spaniards and the
english?"

"spain is her country," replied d’artagnan; "and it is very natural that
she should love the spanish, who are the children of the same soil as
herself. as to the
 
 ___________________________
 
 second reproach, i have heard it said that she does
not love the english, but an englishman."

"well, and by my faith," said athos, "it must be acknowledged that this
englishman is worthy of being loved. i never saw a man with a nobler air
than his."

"without reckoning that he dresses as nobody else can," said porthos. "i
was at the louvre on the day when he scattered his pearls; and, pardieu,
i picked up two that i sold for ten pistoles each. do you know him,
aramis?"

"as well as you do, gentlemen; for i was among those who seized him in
the garden at amiens, into which monsieur putange, the queen’s equerry,
introduce
 
 ___________________________
 
d me. i was at school at the time, and the adventure appeared
to me to be cruel for the king."

"which would not prevent me," said d’artagnan, "if i knew where the duke
of buckingham was, from taking him by the hand and conducting him to the
queen, were it only to enrage the cardinal, and if we could find means
to play him a sharp turn, i vow that i would voluntarily risk my head in
doing it."

"and did the mercer*," rejoined athos, "tell you, d’artagnan, that the
queen thought that buckingham had been brought over by a forged letter?"

_*haberdasher_

"she is afraid so."

"wait a minute, then," said aramis.

"what for?" demanded porthos.

"go on, while i endeavor to recall circumstances."

"and now i am convinced," said d’artagnan, "that this abduction of the
queen’s woman is connected with the events of which we are speaking, and
perhaps with the presence of buckingham in paris."

"the gascon is full of ideas," sa

id porthos, with admiration.

"i like to hear him talk," said athos; "his dialect amuses me."

"gentlemen," cried aramis, "listen to this."

"listen to aramis," said his three friends.

"yesterday i was at the house of a doctor of theology, whom i sometimes
consult about my studies."

athos smiled.

"he resides in a quiet quarter," continued aramis; "his tastes and his
profession require it. now, at the moment when i left his house--"

here aramis paused.

"well," cried his auditors; "at the moment you left his house?"

aramis appeared to make a strong inward effort, like a man who, in the
full relation of a falsehood, finds himself stopped by some unforeseen
obstacle; but the eyes of his three companions were fixed upon him,
their ears were wide open, and there were no means of r

etreat.

"this doctor has a niece," continued aramis.

"ah, he has a niece!" interrupted porthos.

"a very respectable lady," said aramis.

the three friends burst into laughter.

"ah, if you laugh, if you doubt me," replied aramis, "you shall know
nothing."

"we believe like mohammedans, and are as mute as tombstones," said
athos.

"i will continue, then," resumed aramis. "this niece comes sometimes to
see her uncle; and by chance was there yesterday at the same time that i
was, and it was my duty to offer to conduct her to her carriage."

"ah! she has a carriage, then, this niece of the doctor?" interrupted
porthos, one of whose faults was a great looseness of tongue. "a nice
acquaintance, my friend!"

"porthos," replied aramis, "i have had the occasion to observe to you
more than once that you are very indiscreet; and

"all at once, a tall, dark gentleman--just like yours, d’artagnan."

"the same, perhaps," said he.

"possibly," continued aramis, "came toward me, accompanied by five or
six men who followed about ten paces behind him; and in the politest
tone, ’monsieur duke,’ said he to me, ’and you madame,’ continued he,
addressing the lady on my arm--"

"the doctor’s niece?"

"hold your tongue, porthos," said athos; "you are insupportable."

"’--will you enter this carriage, and that without offering the least
resistance, without making the least noise?’"

"he took you for buckingham!" cried d’artagnan.

"i believe so," replied aramis.

"but the lady?" asked porthos.

"he took her for the queen!" said d’artagnan.

"just so," replied aramis.

"the gascon is the devil!" cried athos; "nothing escapes him."

"the fact is," said porthos, "aramis is of the same height, and
something of the shape of the

d the unfortunate mercer rushed
into the chamber in which the council was held.

"save me, gentlemen, for the love of heaven, save me!" cried he. "there
are four men come to arrest me. save me! save me!"

porthos and aramis arose.

"a moment," cried d’artagnan, making them a sign to replace in the
scabbard their half-drawn swords. "it is not courage that is needed; it
is prudence."

"and yet," cried porthos, "we will not leave--"

"you will leave d’artagnan to act as he thinks proper," said athos. "he
has, i repeat, the longest head of the four, and for my part i declare
that i will obey him. do as you think best, d’artagnan."

at this moment the four guards appeared at the door of the antechamber,
but seeing four musketeers standing, and their swords by their sides,
they hesitated about going farther.

"come in, gentlemen, come in," called d’artagnan; "you are here in my
apartment, and we are all faithful servants of the king and cardinal."

"then, gentlemen, you will not oppose ou

r executing the orders we have
received?" asked one who appeared to be the leader of the party.

"on the contrary, gentlemen, we would assist you if it were necessary."

"what does he say?" grumbled porthos.

"you are a simpleton," said athos. "silence!"

"but you promised me--" whispered the poor mercer.

"we can only save you by being free ourselves," replied d’artagnan, in a
rapid, low tone; "and if we appear inclined to defend you, they will
arrest us with you."

"it seems, nevertheless--"

"come, gentlemen, come!" said d’artagnan, aloud; "i have no motive for
defending monsieur. i saw him today for the first time, and he can tell
you on what occasion; he came to demand the rent of my lodging. is that
not true, monsieur bona

al."

the leader of the posse would perhaps have doubted the sincerity of
d’artagnan if the wine had been bad; but the wine was good, and he was
convinced.

"what diabolical villainy you have performed here," said porthos, when
the officer had rejoined his companions and the four friends found
themselves alone. "shame, shame, for four musketeers to allow an
unfortunate fellow who cried for help to be arrested in their midst! and
a gentleman to hobnob with a bailiff!"

"porthos," said aramis, "athos has already told you that you are a
simpleton, and i am quite of his opinion. d’artagnan, you are a great
man; and when you occupy monsieur de treville’s place, i will come and
ask your influence to secure me an abbey."

"well, i am in a maze," said porthos; "do you approve of what d’artagnan
has done?"

"parbleu! indeed i do," said athos; "i not only approve of what he has
done, but i congratulate him upon it."

"and now, gentlemen," said d’artagnan, without stopping to explain his

duct to porthos, "all for one, one for all--that is our motto, is it
not?"

"and yet--" said porthos.

"hold out your hand and swear!" cried athos and aramis at once.

overcome by example, grumbling to himself, nevertheless, porthos
stretched out his hand, and the four friends repeated with one voice the
formula dictated by d’artagnan:

"all for one, one for all."

"that’s well! now let us everyone retire to his own home," said
d’artagnan, as if he had done nothing but command all his life; "and
attention! for from this moment we are at feud with the cardinal."




10 a mousetrap in the seventeenth century

habitues of the establishment. and that is a mousetrap.

the apartment of m. bonacieux, then, became a mousetrap; and whoever
appeared there was taken and interrogated by the cardinal’s people. it
must be observed that as a separate passage led to the first floor, in
which d’artagnan lodged, those who called on him were exempted from this
detention.

besides, nobody came thither but the three musketeers; they had all been
engaged in earnest search and inquiries, but had discovered nothing.
athos had even gone so far as to question m. de treville--a thing which,
considering the habitual reticence of the worthy musketeer, had very
much astonished his captain. but m. de treville knew nothing, except
that the last time he had seen the cardinal, the king, and the queen,
the cardinal looked very thoughtful, the king uneasy, and the redness of
the queen’s eyes donated that she had been sleepless or tearful. but
this last circumstance was not striking, as the queen since her marriage
had sle

pt badly and wept much.

m de treville requested athos, whatever might happen, to be observant of
his duty to the king, but particularly to the queen, begging him to
convey his desires to his comrades.

as to d’artagnan, he did not budge from his apartment. he converted his
chamber into an observatory. from his windows he saw all the visitors
who were caught. then, having removed a plank from his floor, and
nothing remaining but a simple ceiling between him and the room beneath,
in which the interrogatories were made, he heard all that passed bet

ld not question people in this manner,"
said d’artagnan to himself. "now, what is it they want to know? why,
they want to know if the duke of buckingham is in paris, and if he has
had, or is likely to have, an interview with the queen."

d’artagnan held onto this idea, which, from what he had heard, was not
wanting in probability.

in the meantime, the mousetrap continued in operation, and likewise
d’artagnan’s vigilance.

on the evening of the day after the arrest of poor bonacieux, as athos
had just left d’artagnan to report at m. de treville’s, as nine o’clock
had just struck, and as planchet, who had not yet made the bed, was
beginning his task, a knocking was heard at the street door. the door
was instantly opened and shut; someone was taken in the mousetrap.

d’artagnan flew to his hole, laid himself down on the floor at full
length, and listened.

cries were soon heard, and then moans, which someone appeared to be
endeavoring to stifle. there were no questions.

"the

what everybody is seeking for?"

the voice became more and more indistinct; a tumultuous movement shook
the partition. the victim resisted as much as a woman could resist four
men.

"pardon, gentlemen--par--" murmured the voice, which could now only be
heard in inarticulate sounds.

"they are binding her; they are going to drag her away," cried
d’artagnan to himself, springing up from the floor. "my sword! good, it
is by my side! planchet!"

"monsieur."

"run and seek athos, porthos and aramis. one of the three will certainly
be at home, perhaps all three. tell them to take arms, to come here, and
to run! ah, i remember, athos is at monsieur de treville’s."

"but where are you going, monsieur, where are you going?"

"i am going down by the window, in order to be there the sooner," cried
d’artagnan. "you put back the boards, sweep the floor, go out at the
door, and run as i told you."

"oh, monsieur! monsieur! you will kill yourself," cried planchet.

"hold you

truthful that no one could mistake it.

"then i believe you. you appear to be a brave young man; besides, your
fortune may perhaps be the result of your devotedness."

"i will do, without a promise and voluntarily, all that i can do to
serve the king and be agreeable to the queen. dispose of me, then, as a
friend."

"but i--where shall i go meanwhile?"

"is there nobody from whose house monsieur laporte can come and fetch
you?"

"no, i can trust nobody."

"stop," said d’artagnan; "we are near athos’s door. yes, here it is."

"who is this athos?"

"one of my friends."

"but if he should be at home and see me?"

"he is not at home, and i will carry away the key, after having placed
you in his apartment."

"but if he should return?"

"oh, he won’t return; and if he should, he will be told that i have
brought a woman with me, and that woman is in his apartment."

"but that will compromise me sadly, you know."

"of what consequence? nobody knows you. besides, we are in a situation
to overl

ook ceremony."

"come, then, let us go to your friend’s house. where does he live?"

"rue ferou, two steps from here."

"let us go!"

both resumed their way. as d’artagnan had foreseen, athos was not
within. he took the key, which was customarily given him as one of the
family, ascended the stairs, and introduced mme. bonacieux into the
little apartment of which we have given a description.

"you are at home," said he. "remain here, fasten the door inside, and
open it to nobody unless you hear three taps like this;" and he tapped
thrice--two taps close together and pretty hard, the other after an
interval, and lighter.

"that is well," said mme. bonacieux. "now, in my turn, let me g

herself; and although it is generally with her husband’s money that she
procures herself this indulgence, the gratitude for it seldom reverts to
him.

then d’artagnan, disposed to become the most tender of lovers, was at
the same time a very devoted friend. in the midst of his amorous
projects for the mercer’s wife, he did not forget his friends. the
pretty mme. bonacieux was just the woman to walk with in the plain st.
denis or in the fair of st. germain, in company with athos, porthos, and
aramis, to whom d’artagnan had often remarked this. then one could enjoy
charming little dinners, where one touches on one side the hand of a
friend, and on the other the foot of a mistress. besides, on pressing
occasions, in extreme difficulties, d’artagnan would become the
preserver of his friends.

and m. bonacieux, whom d’artagnan had pushed into the hands of the
officers, denying him aloud although he had promised in a whisper to
save him? we are compelled to admit to o

e shutter, three light and regular taps. when he had
gained the angle of the street, he turned. the door had been opened, and
shut again; the mercer’s pretty wife had disappeared.

d’artagnan pursued his way. he had given his word not to watch mme.
bonacieux, and if his life had depended upon the spot to which she was
going or upon the person who should accompany her, d’artagnan would have
returned home, since he had so promised. five minutes later he was in
the rue des fossoyeurs.

"poor athos!" said he; "he will never guess what all this means. he will
have fallen asleep waiting for me, or else he will have returned home,
where he will have learned that a woman had been there. a woman with
athos! after all," continued d’artagnan, "there was certainly one with
aramis. all this is very strange; and i am curious to know how it will
end."

"badly, monsieur, badly!" replied a voice which the young man recognized
as that of planchet; for, soliloquizing aloud, as very preoccupied

do, he had entered the alley, at the end of which were the stairs
which led to his chamber.

"how, badly? what do you mean by that, you idiot?" asked d’artagnan.
"what has happened?"

"all sorts of misfortunes."

"what?"

"in the first place, monsieur athos is arrested."

"arrested! athos arrested! what for?"

"he was found in your lodging; they took him for you."

"and by whom was he arrested?"

"by guards brought by the men in black whom you put to flight."

"why did he not tell them his name? why did he not tell them he knew
nothing about this affair?"

"he took care not to do so, monsieur; on the contrary, he came up to me
and said, ’it is your master that needs his liberty at this moment and
not i, since he knows everything and i know nothing. they will believe
he is arre

sted, and that will give him time; in three days i will tell
them who i am, and they cannot fail to let me go.’"

"bravo, athos! noble heart!" murmured d’artagnan. "i know him well
there! and what did the officers do?"

"four conveyed him away, i don’t know where--to the bastille or fort
l’eveque. two remained with the men in black, who rummaged every place
and took all the papers. the last two mounted guard at the door during
this examination; then, when all was over, they went away, leaving the
house empty and exposed."

"and porthos and aramis?"

"i could not find them; they did not come."

"but they may come a

and in virtue of that compact put to flight the police who had arrested
your wife, and has placed her beyond reach."

"m. d’artagnan has abducted my wife! come now, what are you telling me?"

"fortunately, monsieur d’artagnan is in our hands, and you shall be
confronted with him."

"by my faith, i ask no better," cried bonacieux; "i shall not be sorry
to see the face of an acquaintance."

"bring in the monsieur d’artagnan," said the commissary to the guards.
the two guards led in athos.

"monsieur d’artagnan," said the commissary, addressing athos, "declare
all that passed yesterday between you and monsieur."

"but," cried bonacieux, "this is not monsieur d’artagnan whom you show
me."

"what! not monsieur d’artagnan?" exclaimed the commissary.

"not the least in the world," replied bonacieux.

"what is this gentleman’s name?" asked the commissary.

"i cannot tell you; i don’t know him."

"how! you don’t know him?"

"no."

"did you never see him?"

"yes, i have see

n him, but i don’t know what he calls himself."

"your name?" replied the commissary.

"athos," replied the musketeer.

"but that is not a man’s name; that is the name of a mountain," cried
the poor questioner, who began to lose his head.

"that is my name," said athos, quietly.

"but you said that your name was d’artagnan."

"who, i?"

"yes, you."

"somebody said to me, ’you are monsieur d’artagnan?’ i answered, ’you
think so?’ my guards exclaimed that they were sure of it. i did not wish
to contradict them; besides, i might be deceived."

"monsieur, you insult the majesty of justice."

"not at all," said athos, calmly.

"you are monsieur d’artagnan."

"you see, monsieur, that you say it again."

"but i tell you, monsieur commissary," cried bon

me how my own proper affair can become worse by anything my wife does
while i am in prison?"

"because that which she does is part of a plan concerted between you--of
an infernal plan."

"i swear to you, monsieur commissary, that you are in the profoundest
error, that i know nothing in the world about what my wife had to do,
that i am entirely a stranger to what she has done; and that if she has
committed any follies, i renounce her, i abjure her, i curse her!"

"bah!" said athos to the commissary, "if you have no more need of me,
send me somewhere. your monsieur bonacieux is very tiresome."

the commissary designated by the same gesture athos and bonacieux, "let
them be guarded more closely than ever."

"and yet," said athos, with his habitual calmness, "if it be monsieur
d’artagnan who is concerned in this matter, i do not perceive how i can
take his place."

"do as i bade you," cried the commissary, "and preserve absolute
secrecy. you understand!"

athos shrugged h

with the order for the two hundred pistoles, and retired.

here is what the letter contained:

milady, be at the first ball at which the duke of buckingham shall be
present. he will wear on his doublet twelve diamond studs; get as near
to him as you can, and cut off two.

as soon as these studs shall be in your possession, inform me.




15 men of the robe and men of the sword


on the day after these events had taken place, athos not having
reappeared, m. de treville was informed by d’artagnan and porthos of the
circumstance. as to aramis, he had asked for leave of absence for five
days, and was gone, it was said, to rouen on family business.

m de treville was the father of his soldiers. the lowest or the least
known of them, as soon as he assumed the uniform of the company, was as
sure of his aid and support as if he had been his own brother.

he repaired, then, instantly to the office of the lieutenant-criminel.

e officer who commanded the post of the red cross was sent for, and by
successive inquiries they learned that athos was then lodged in fort
l’eveque.

athos had passed through all the examinations we have seen bonacieux
undergo.

we were present at the scene in which the two captives were confronted
with each other. athos, who had till that time said nothing for fear
that d’artagnan, interrupted in his turn, should not have the time
necessary, from this moment declared that his name was athos, and not
d’artagnan. he added that he did not know either m. or mme. bonacieux;
that he had never spoken to the one or the other; that he had come, at
about ten o’clock in the evening, to pay a visit to his friend m.
d’artagnan, but that till that hour he had been at m. de treville’s,
where he had dined. "twenty witnesses," added he, "could attest the
fact"; and he named several distinguished gentlemen, and among them was
m. le duc de la tremouille.

the second commissary was as much be

wildered as the first had been by
the simple and firm declaration of the musketeer, upon whom he was
anxious to take the revenge which men of the robe like at all times to
gain over men of the sword; but the name of m. de treville, and that of
m. de la tremouille, commanded a little reflection.

athos was then sent to the cardinal; but unfortunately the cardinal was
at the louvre with the king.

it was precisely at this moment that m. de treville, on leaving the
residence of the lieutenant-criminel and the governor of fort l’eveque
without being able to find athos, arrived at the palace.

as captain of the musketeers, m. de treville had the right of entry at
all times.

it is well known how violent the king’s prejudices were against the
queen, and how carefully these prejudices were kept

the same tone, "that a party of procureurs, commissaries, and men of the
police--very estimable people, but very inveterate, as it appears,
against the uniform--have taken upon themselves to arrest in a house, to
lead away through the open street, and throw into fort l’eveque, all
upon an order which they have refused to show me, one of my, or rather
your musketeers, sire, of irreproachable conduct, of an almost
illustrious reputation, and whom your majesty knows favorably, monsieur
athos."

"athos," said the king, mechanically; "yes, certainly i know that name."

"let your majesty remember," said treville, "that monsieur athos is the
musketeer who, in the annoying duel which you are acquainted with, had
the misfortune to wound monsieur de cahusac so seriously. a propos,
monseigneur," continued treville, addressing the cardinal, "monsieur de
cahusac is quite recovered, is he not?"

"thank you," said the cardinal, biting his lips with anger.

"athos, then, went to pay a visit to

said the king, who began to be shaken, "was it so managed?"

"monsieur de treville," said the cardinal, with the greatest phlegm,
"does not tell your majesty that this innocent musketeer, this gallant
man, had only an hour before attacked, sword in hand, four commissaries
of inquiry, who were delegated by myself to examine into an affair of
the highest importance."

"i defy your eminence to prove it," cried treville, with his gascon
freedom and military frankness; "for one hour before, monsieur athos,
who, i will confide it to your majesty, is really a man of the highest
quality, did me the honor after having dined with me to be conversing in
the saloon of my hotel, with the duc de la tremouille and the comte de
chalus, who happened to be there."

the king looked at the cardinal.

"a written examination attests it," said the cardinal, replying aloud to
the mute interrogation of his majesty; "and the ill-treated people have
drawn up the following, which i have the honor to present to your

said treville, "the justice of monsieur the cardinal is so well known
that i demand an inquiry."

"in the house in which the judicial inquiry was made," continued the
impassive cardinal, "there lodges, i believe, a young bearnais, a friend
of the musketeer."

"your eminence means monsieur d’artagnan."

"i mean a young man whom you patronize, monsieur de treville."

"yes, your eminence, it is the same."

"do you not suspect this young man of having given bad counsel?"

"to athos, to a man double his age?" interrupted treville. "no,
monseigneur. besides, d’artagnan passed the evening with me."

"well," said the cardinal, "everybody seems to have passed the evening
with you."

"does your eminence doubt my word?" said treville, with a brow flushed
with anger.

"no, god forbid," said the cardinal; "only, at what hour was he with
you?"

"oh, as to that i can speak positively, your eminence; for as he came in
i remarked that it was but half past nine by the clock, although

 i had
believed it to be later."

"at what hour did he leave your hotel?"

"at half past ten--an hour after the event."

"well," replied the cardinal, who could not for an instant suspect the
loyalty of treville, and who felt that the victory was escaping him,
"well, but athos was taken in the house in the rue des fossoyeurs."

"is one friend forbidden to visit another, or a musketeer of my company
to fraternize with a guard of dessessart’s company?"

"yes, when the house where he fraternizes is suspected."

"that house is suspected, treville," said the king; "perhaps you did not
know it?"

"indeed, sire, i did not. the house may be suspected; but i deny that it
is so in the part of it inhabited by monsieur d’artagnan, for i can
affirm, sire, if i can believe wha

danger. what a noise about a musketeer! i would arrest ten of them,
ventrebleu, a hundred, even, all the company, and i would not allow a
whisper."

"from the moment they are suspected by your majesty," said treville,
"the musketeers are guilty; therefore, you see me prepared to surrender
my sword--for after having accused my soldiers, there can be no doubt
that monsieur the cardinal will end by accusing me. it is best to
constitute myself at once a prisoner with athos, who is already
arrested, and with d’artagnan, who most probably will be."

"gascon-headed man, will you have done?" said the king.

"sire," replied treville, without lowering his voice in the least,
"either order my musketeer to be restored to me, or let him be tried."

"he shall be tried," said the cardinal.

"well, so much the better; for in that case i shall demand of his
majesty permission to plead for him."

the king feared an outbreak.

"if his eminence," said he, "did not have persona

the cardinal saw what the king was about to say and interrupted him:

"pardon me," said he; "but the instant your majesty considers me a
prejudiced judge, i withdraw."

"come," said the king, "will you swear, by my father, that athos was at
your residence during the event and that he took no part in it?"

"by your glorious father, and by yourself, whom i love and venerate
above all the world, i swear it."

"be so kind as to reflect, sire," said the cardinal. "if we release the
prisoner thus, we shall never know the truth."

"athos may always be found," replied treville, "ready to answer, when it
shall please the gownsmen to interrogate him. he will not desert,
monsieur the cardinal, be assured of that; i will answer for him

mme. bonacieux made no reply; but her heart beat with joy and secret
hope shone in her eyes.

"and what guarantee will you give me," asked she, "if i consent to
confide this message to you?"

"my love for you. speak! command! what is to be done?"

"my god, my god!" murmured the young woman, "ought i to confide such a
secret to you, monsieur? you are almost a boy."

"i see that you require someone to answer for me?"

"i admit that would reassure me greatly."

"do you know athos?"

"no."

"porthos?"

"no."

"aramis?"

"no. who are these gentleman?"

"three of the king’s musketeers. do you know monsieur de treville, their
captain?"

"oh, yes, him! i know him; not personally, but from having heard the
queen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal gentleman."

"you do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal?"

"oh, no, certainly not!"

"well, reveal your secret to him, and ask him whether, however
important, however valuable, however terrible it may

"and you are going alone?"

"i am going alone."

"in that case you will not get beyond bondy. i tell you so, by the faith
of de treville."

"how so?"

"you will be assassinated."

"and i shall die in the performance of my duty."

"but your mission will not be accomplished."

"that is true," replied d’artagnan.

"believe me," continued treville, "in enterprises of this kind, in order
that one may arrive, four must set out."

"ah, you are right, monsieur," said d’artagnan; "but you know athos,
porthos, and aramis, and you know if i can dispose of them."

"without confiding to them the secret which i am not willing to know?"

"we are sworn, once for all, to implicit confidence and devotedness
against all proof. besides, you can tell them that you have full
confidence in me, and they will not be more incredulous than you."

"i can send to each of them leave of absence for fifteen days, that is
all--to athos, whose wound still makes him suffer, to go to the waters
of forges; to porthos

red times too good."

"begone, then, find them instantly, and let all be done tonight! ha! but
first write your request to dessessart. perhaps you had a spy at your
heels; and your visit, if it should ever be known to the cardinal, will
thus seem legitimate."

d’artagnan drew up his request, and m. de treville, on receiving it,
assured him that by two o’clock in the morning the four leaves of
absence should be at the respective domiciles of the travelers.

"have the goodness to send mine to athos’s residence. i should dread
some disagreeable encounter if i were to go home."

"be easy. adieu, and a prosperous voyage. a propos," said m. de
treville, calling him back.

d’artagnan returned.

"have you any money?"

d’artagnan tapped the bag he had in his pocket.

"enough?" asked m. de treville.

"three hundred pistoles."

"oh, plenty! that would carry you to the end of the world. begone,
then!"

d’artagnan saluted m. de treville, who held out his hand to him;

ause could she have returned to paris?"

"for the cause which today takes us to england."

"and what is this cause?" demanded aramis.

"oh, you’ll know it someday, aramis; but at present i must imitate the
discretion of ’the doctor’s niece.’"

aramis smiled, as he remembered the tale he had told his friends on a
certain evening. "well, then, since she has left paris, and you are sure
of it, d’artagnan, nothing prevents me, and i am ready to follow you.
you say we are going--"

"to see athos now, and if you will come thither, i beg you to make
haste, for we have lost much time already. a propos, inform bazin."

"will bazin go with us?" asked aramis.

"perhaps so. at all events, it is best that he should follow us to
athos’s."

aramis called bazin, and, after having ordered him to join them at
athos’s residence, said "let us go then," at the same time taking his
cloak, sword, and three pistols, opening uselessly two or three drawers
to see if he could not find stray coin. when w

was superfluous, he followed d’artagnan, wondering to himself how this
young guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had
given hospitality, and that he should know better than himself what had
become of her.

only as they went out aramis placed his hand upon the arm of d’artagnan,
and looking at him earnestly, "you have not spoken of this lady?" said
he.

"to nobody in the world."

"not even to athos or porthos?"

"i have not breathed a syllable to them."

"good enough!"

tranquil on this important point, aramis continued his way with
d’artagnan, and both soon arrived at athos’s dwelling. they found him
holding his leave of absence in one hand, and m. de treville’s note in
the other.

"can you explain to me what signify this leave of absence and this
letter, which i have just received?" said the astonished athos.

my dear athos,

i wish, as your health absolutely requires it, that you

 should rest for
a fortnight. go, then, and take the waters of forges, or any that may be
more agreeable to you, and recuperate yourself as quickly as possible.

yours affectionate,

de treville

"well, this leave of absence and that letter mean that you must follow
me, athos."

"to the waters of forges?"

"there or elsewhere."

"in the king’s service?"

"either the king’s or the queen’s. are we not their majesties’
servants?"

at that moment porthos entered. "pardieu!" said he, "here is a strange
thing! since when, i wonder, in the musketeers, did they grant men leave
of absence without their asking for it?"

"since," said d’artagnan, "they have friends who ask it for them."

"ah, ah!" said porthos, "it appears there’s something fresh here."

"yes, we a

re going--" said aramis.

"to what country?" demanded porthos.

"my faith! i don’t know much about it," said athos. "ask d’artagnan."

"to london, gentlemen," said d’artagnan.

"to london!" cried porthos; "and what the devil are we going to do in
london?"

"that is what i am not at liberty to tell you, gentlemen; you must trust
to me."

"but in order to go to london," added porthos, "money is needed, and i
have none."

"nor i," said aramis.

"nor i," said athos.

"i have," replied d’artagnan, pulling out his treasure from his pocket,
and placing it on the table. "there are in this bag three hundred
pistoles. let each take seventy-five; that is enough to take us to
london and back. besides, make yourselves easy; we shall not all arrive
at london."

"why so?"

"because, in all probability, some one of us will be left on the road."

"is this, then, a campaign upon which we are now entering?"

"one of a most dangerous kind, i give you notice."

"ah! but
 
 ___________________________
 
 if we do risk being killed," said porthos, "at least i should
like to know what for."

"you would be all the wiser," said athos.

"and yet," said aramis, "i am somewhat of porthos’s opinion."

"is the king accustomed to give you such reasons? no. he says to you
jauntily, ’gentlemen, there is fighting going on in gascony or in
flanders; go and fight,’ and you go there. why? you need give yourselves
no more uneasiness about this."

"d’artagnan is right," said athos; "here are our three leaves of absence
which came from monsieur de treville, and here are three hundred
pistoles which came from i don’t know where. so let us go and get killed
where we are told to go. is life worth the trouble of so many questions?
d’artagnan, i am ready to follow you."

"and i also," said porthos.

"and i also," said aramis. "and, indeed, i am not sorry to quit paris; i
had need of distraction."

"well, you will have distractions enough, gentlemen, be assured," said
d’a

rtagnan.

"and, now, when are we to go?" asked athos.

"immediately," replied d’artagnan; "we have not a minute to lose."

"hello, grimaud! planchet! mousqueton! bazin!" cried the four young men,
calling their lackeys, "clean my boots, and fetch the horses from the
hotel."

each musketeer was accustomed to leave at the general hotel, as at a
barrack, his own horse and that of his lackey. planchet, grimaud,
mousqueton, and bazin set off at full speed.

"now let us lay down the plan of campaign," said porthos. "where do we
go first?"

"to calais,
 
 ___________________________
 
" said d’artagnan; "that is the most direct line to london."

"well," said porthos, "this is my advice--"

"speak!"

"four men traveling together would be suspected. d’artagnan will give
each of us his instructions. i will go by the way of boulogne to clear
the way; athos will set out two hours after, by that of amiens; aramis
will follow us by that of noyon; as to d’artagnan, he will go by what
route he thinks is best, in planchet’s clothes, while planchet will
follow us like d’artagnan, in the uniform of the guards."

"gentlemen," said athos, "my opinion is that it is not proper to allow
lackeys to have anything to do in such an affair. a secret may, by
chance, be betrayed by gentlemen; but it is almost always sold by
lackeys."

"porthos’s plan appears
 
 ___________________________
 
f a letter, that is all. i have not, and i cannot make
three copies of that letter, because it is sealed. we must, then, as it
appears to me, travel in company. this letter is here, in this pocket,"
and he pointed to the pocket which contained the letter. "if i should be
killed, one of you must take it, and continue the route; if he be
killed, it will be another’s turn, and so on--provided a single one
arrives, that is all that is required."

"bravo, d’artagnan, your opinion is mine," cried athos, "besides, we
must be consistent; i am going to take the waters, you will accompany
me. instead of taking the waters of forges, i go and take sea waters; i
am free to do so. if anyone wishes to stop us, i will show monsieur de
treville’s letter, and you will show your leaves of absence. if we are
attacked, we will defend ourselves; if we are tried, we will stoutly
maintain that we were only anxious to dip ourselves a certain number of
times in the sea. they would have an easy bargain of four

isolated men;
whereas four men together make a troop. we will arm our four lackeys
with pistols and musketoons; if they send an army out against us, we
will give battle, and the survivor, as d’artagnan says, will carry the
letter."

"well said," cried aramis; "you don’t often speak, athos, but when you
do speak, it is like st. john of the golden mouth. i agree to athos’s
plan. and you, porthos?"

"i agree to it, too," said porthos, "if d’artagnan approves of it.
d’artagnan, being the bearer of the letter, is naturally the head of the
enterprise; let him decide, and we will execute."

"well," said d’artagnan, "i decide that we should adopt athos’s plan,
and that we set off in half an hour."

"agreed!" shouted the three musketeers in chorus.

each one, stretching out his hand to the bag, took his seventy-five
pistoles, and made his preparations to set

the travelers returned his politeness.

but at the moment mousqueton came to announce that the horses were
ready, and they were arising from table, the stranger proposed to
porthos to drink the health of the cardinal. porthos replied that he
asked no better if the stranger, in his turn, would drink the health of
the king. the stranger cried that he acknowledged no other king but his
eminence. porthos called him drunk, and the stranger drew his sword.

"you have committed a piece of folly," said athos, "but it can’t be
helped; there is no drawing back. kill the fellow, and rejoin us as soon
as you can."

all three remounted their horses, and set out at a good pace, while
porthos was promising his adversary to perforate him with all the
thrusts known in the fencing schools.

"there goes one!" cried athos, at the end of five hundred paces.

"but why did that man attack porthos rather than any other one of us?"
asked aramis.

"because, as porthos was talking louder than the rest of us, he too

k him
for the chief," said d’artagnan.

"i always said that this cadet from gascony was a well of wisdom,"
murmured athos; and the travelers continued their route.

at beauvais they stopped two hours, as well to breathe their horses a
little as to wait for porthos. at the end of two hours, as porthos did
not come, not any news of him, they resumed their journey.

at a league from beauvais, where the road was confined between two high
banks, they fell in with eight or ten men who, taking advantage of the
road being unpaved in this spot, appeared to be employed in digging
holes and filling up the ruts with mud.

ara

mis, not liking to soil his boots with this artificial mortar,
apostrophized them rather sharply. athos wished to restrain him, but it
was too late. the laborers began to jeer the travelers and by their
insolence disturbed the equanimity even of the cool athos, who urged on
his horse against one of them.

then each of these men retreated as far as the ditch, from which each
took a concealed musket; the result was that our seven travelers were
outnumbered in weapons. aramis received a ball which passed through his
shoulder, and mousqueton another ball which lodged in the fleshy part
which prolongs the lower portion of the loins. therefore mousqueton
alone fell from his horse, not because he was severely wounded, but not
being able to see the wound, he
 
 ___________________________
 
 judged it to be more serious than it
really was.

"it was an ambuscade!" shouted d’artagnan. "don’t waste a charge!
forward!"

aramis, wounded as he was, seized the mane of his horse, which carried
him on with the others. mousqueton’s horse rejoined them, and galloped
by the side of his companions.

"that will serve us for a relay," said athos.

"i would rather have had a hat," said d’artagnan. "mine was carried away
by a ball. by my faith, it is very fortunate that the letter was not in
it."

"they’ll kill poor porthos when he comes up," said aramis.

"if porthos were on his legs, he would have rejoined us by this time,"
said athos. "my opinion is that on the ground the drunken man was not
intoxicated."

they continued at their best speed for two hours, although the horses
were so fatigued that it was to be feared they would soo

with less interruption; but at crevecoeur, aramis declared he could
proceed no farther. in fact, it required all the courage which he
concealed beneath his elegant form and polished manners to bear him so
far. he grew more pale every minute, and they were obliged to support
him on his horse. they lifted him off at the door of a cabaret, left
bazin with him, who, besides, in a skirmish was more embarrassing than
useful, and set forward again in the hope of sleeping at amiens.

"morbleu," said athos, as soon as they were again in motion, "reduced to
two masters and grimaud and planchet! morbleu! i won’t be their dupe, i
will answer for it. i will neither open my mouth nor draw my sword
between this and calais. i swear by--"

"don’t waste time in swearing," said d’artagnan; "let us gallop, if our
horses will consent."

and the travelers buried their rowels in their horses’ flanks, who thus
vigorously stimulated recovered their energies. they arrived at amiens
at midnight, and alight

the host had the appearance of as honest a man as any on earth. he
received the travelers with his candlestick in one hand and his cotton
nightcap in the other. he wished to lodge the two travelers each in a
charming chamber; but unfortunately these charming chambers were at the
opposite extremities of the hotel. d’artagnan and athos refused them.
the host replied that he had no other worthy of their excellencies; but
the travelers declared they would sleep in the common chamber, each on a
mattress which might be thrown upon the ground. the host insisted; but
the travelers were firm, and he was obliged to do as they wished.

they had just prepared their beds and barricaded their door within, when
someone knocked at the yard shutter; they demanded who was there, and
recognizing the voices of their lackeys, opened the shutter

. it was
indeed planchet and grimaud.

"grimaud can take care of the horses," said planchet. "if you are
willing, gentlemen, i will sleep across your doorway, and you will then
be certain that nobody can reach you."

"and on what will you sleep?" said d’artagnan.

"here is my bed," replied planchet, producing a bundle of straw.

"come, then," said d’artagnan, "you are right. mine host’s face does not
please me at all; it is too gracious."

"nor me either," said athos.

planchet mounted by the window and installed himself across the doorway,
while grimaud went and shut himself up in the stable, undertaking that
by five o’clock in the morning he and the four horses should be ready.

the night was quiet enough. toward two o’clock in the morning somebody
endeavored to open the door; but as planchet awoke in an instant and
cried, "who goes there?" somebody replied that he was mistaken, and went
away.

at four o’clock in the morning they heard a terrible ri

 yard, and wished to saddle the horses; but
the horses were all used up. mousqueton’s horse which had traveled for
five or six hours without a rider the day before, might have been able
to pursue the journey; but by an inconceivable error the veterinary
surgeon, who had been sent for, as it appeared, to bleed one of the
host’s horses, had bled mousqueton’s.

this began to be annoying. all these successive accidents were perhaps
the result of chance; but they might be the fruits of a plot. athos and
d’artagnan went out, while planchet was sent to inquire if there were
not three horses for sale in the neighborhood. at the door stood two
horses, fresh, strong, and fully equipped. these would just have suited
them. he asked where their masters were, and was informed that they had
passed the night in the inn, and were then settling their bill with the
host.

athos went down to pay the reckoning, while d’artagnan and planchet
stood at the street door. the host was in a lower and back ro

om, to
which athos was requested to go.

athos entered without the least mistrust, and took out two pistoles to
pay the bill. the host was alone, seated before his desk, one of the
drawers of which was partly open. he took the money which athos offered
to him, and after turning and turning it over and over in his hands,
suddenly cried out that it was bad, and that he would have him and his
companions arrested as forgers.

"you blackguard!" cried athos, going toward him, "i’ll cut your ears
off!"

at the same instant, four men, armed to the teeth, entered by side
doors, and rushed upon athos.

"i am taken!" shouted athos, with all the power of his lungs. "go on,
d’artagnan! spur, spur!" and he fired two pistols.

d’artagnan and planchet did not require twice bidding; they unfastened
the two horses that were waiting at the door, leaped upon them, buried
their spurs in their sides, and set off at full gallop.

"do you know what has become

 of athos?" asked d’artagnan of planchet, as
they galloped on.

"ah, monsieur," said planchet, "i saw one fall at each of his two shots,
and he appeared to me, through the glass door, to be fighting with his
sword with the others."

"brave athos!" murmured d’artagnan, "and to think that we are compelled
to leave him; maybe the same fate awaits us two paces hence. forward,
planchet, forward! you are a brave fellow."

"as i told you, monsieur," replied planchet, "picards are found out by
being used. besides, i am here in my own country, and that excites me."

and both, with free use of the spur, arrived at st. omer without drawing
bit. at st. omer they breathed their horses with the bridles passed
under their arms for fear of accident,

planchet, emboldened by the first exploit, sprang upon lubin; and being
strong and vigorous, he soon got him on the broad of his back, and
placed his knee upon his breast.

"go on with your affair, monsieur," cried planchet; "i have finished
mine."

seeing this, the gentleman drew his sword, and sprang upon d’artagnan;
but he had too strong an adversary. in three seconds d’artagnan had
wounded him three times, exclaiming at each thrust, "one for athos, one
for porthos; and one for aramis!"

at the third hit the gentleman fell like a log. d’artagnan believed him
to be dead, or at least insensible, and went toward him for the purpose
of taking the order; but the moment he extended his hand to search for
it, the wounded man, who had not dropped his sword, plunged the point
into d’artagnan’s breast, crying, "one for you!"

"and one for me--the best for last!" cried d’artagnan, furious, nailing
him to the earth with a fourth thrust throug

that’s sacred that she does

paris."

"you are right, my dear monsieur bonacieux, my friends and i have been
on a little journey."

"far from here?"

"oh, lord, no! about forty leagues only. we went to take monsieur athos
to the waters of forges, where my friends still remain."

"and you have returned, have you not?" replied m. bonacieux, giving to
his countenance a most sly air. "a handsome young fellow like you does
not obtain long leaves of absence from his mistress; and we were
impatiently waited for at paris, were we not?"

began to disquiet, "the devil! what must i do?"

"above all things be always on your guard. the cardinal has a tenacious
memory and a long arm; you may depend upon it, he will repay you by some
ill turn."

"but of what sort?"

"eh! how can i tell? has he not all the tricks of a demon at his
command? the least that can be expected is that you will be arrested."

"what! will they dare to arrest a man in his majesty’s service?"

"pardieu! they did not scruple much in the case of athos. at all events,
young man, rely upon one who has been thirty years at court. do not lull
yourself in security, or you will be lost; but, on the contrary--and it
is i who say it--see enemies in all directions. if anyone seeks a
quarrel with you, shun it, were it with a child of ten years old. if you
are attacked by day or by night, fight, but retreat, without shame; if
you cross a bridge, feel every plank of it with your foot, lest one
should give way beneath you; if you pass before a house whic

ening; but we are bound to say, to the credit of our
hero, that the bad opinion entertained by m. de treville of women in
general, did not inspire him with the least suspicion of his pretty
hostess.

"but, a propos," resumed m. de treville, "what has become of your three
companions?"

"i was about to ask you if you had heard any news of them?"

"none, monsieur."

"well, i left them on my road--porthos at chantilly, with a duel on his
hands; aramis at crevecoeur, with a ball in his shoulder; and athos at
amiens, detained by an accusation of coining."

"see there, now!" said m. de treville; "and how the devil did you
escape?"

"by a miracle, monsieur, i must acknowledge, with a sword thrust in my
breast, and by nailing the comte de wardes on the byroad to calais, like
a butterfly on a tapestry."

"there again! de wardes, one of the cardinal’s men, a cousin of
rochefort! stop, my friend, i have an idea."

"speak, monsieur."

"in your place, i would do one thing."

"what?"

"while his eminenc

want."

"but your companions?"

"i don’t think they can be in need of any. we left paris, each with
seventy-five pistoles in his pocket."

"shall i see you again before your departure?"

"i think not, monsieur, unless something new should happen."

"well, a pleasant journey."

"thanks, monsieur."

d’artagnan left m. de treville, touched more than ever by his paternal
solicitude for his musketeers.

he called successively at the abodes of athos, porthos, and aramis.
neither of them had returned. their lackeys likewise were absent, and
nothing had been heard of either the one or the other. he would have
inquired after them of their mistresses, but he was neither acquainted
with porthos’s nor aramis’s, and as to athos, he had none.

as he passed the hotel des gardes, he took a glance in to the stables.
three of the four horses had already arrived. planchet, all
astonishment, was busy grooming them, and had already finished two.

"ah

then lie at my door, and as i am not a
gentleman, i may be allowed to lie."

"be of good heart, planchet, you shall preserve your reputation as a
veracious man. in a quarter of an hour we set off."

"that’s the advice i was about to give monsieur; and where are we going,
may i ask, without being too curious?"

"pardieu! in the opposite direction to that which you said i was gone.
besides, are you not as anxious to learn news of grimaud, mousqueton,
and bazin as i am to know what has become of athos, porthos, and
aramis?"

"yes, monsieur," said planchet, "and i will go as soon as you please.

the air of paris. so then--"

"so then, pack up our luggage, planchet, and let us be off. on my part,
i will go out with my hands in my pockets, that nothing may be
suspected. you may join me at the hotel des gardes. by the way,
planchet, i think you are right with respect to our host, and that he is
decidedly a frightfully low wretc

"well," said porthos, "arrange the table, mousqueton, and while we
breakfast, d’artagnan will relate to us what has happened to him during
the ten days since he left us."

"willingly," said d’artagnan.

while porthos and mousqueton were breakfasting, with the appetites of
convalescents and with that brotherly cordiality which unites men in
misfortune, d’artagnan related how aramis, being wounded, was obliged to
stop at crevecoeur, how he had left athos fighting at amiens with four
men who accused him of being a coiner, and how he, d’artagnan, had been
forced to run the comtes de wardes through the body in order to reach
england.

but there the confidence of d’artagnan stopped. he only added that on
his return from great britain he had brought back four magnificent
horses--one for himself, and one for each of his companions; then he
informed porthos that the one intended for him was already installed in
the stable of the tavern.

compliment i have related to you. it was a superb moonlight night. we
immediately drew, and at the first pass i laid him stark dead."

"the devil!" cried d’artagnan.

"now," continued aramis, "as the ladies did not see the singer come
back, and as he was found in the rue payenne with a great sword wound
through his body, it was supposed that i had accommodated him thus; and
the matter created some scandal which obliged me to renounce the cassock
for a time. athos, whose acquaintance i made about that period, and
porthos, who had in addition to my lessons taught me some effective
tricks of fence, prevailed upon me to solicit the uniform of a
musketeer. the king entertained great regard for my father, who had
fallen at the siege of arras, and the uniform was granted. you may
understand that the moment has come for me to re-enter the bosom of the
church."

spinach, and the spinach onto the floor.

"now this is the moment to consecrate your existence to the king of
kings," said d’artagnan, "if you persist in offering him a civility. non
inutile desiderium oblatione."

"go to the devil with your latin. let us drink, my dear d’artagnan,
morbleu! let us drink while the wine is fresh! let us drink heartily,
and while we do so, tell me a little of what is going on in the world
yonder."




27 the wife of athos


we have now to search for athos," said d’artagnan to the vivacious
aramis, when he had informed him of all that had passed since their
departure from the capital, and an excellent dinner had made one of them
forget his thesis and the other his fatigue.

"do you think, then, that any harm can have happened to him?" asked
aramis. "athos is so cool, so brave, and handles his sword so
skillfully."

"no doubt. nobody has a higher opinion of the courage and skill of athos
than i have; but i like

better to hear my sword clang against lances
than against staves. i fear lest athos should have been beaten down by
serving men. those fellows strike hard, and don’t leave off in a hurry.
this is why i wish to set out again as soon as possible."

"i will try to accompany you," said aramis, "though i scarcely feel in a
condition to mount on horseback. yesterday i undertook to employ that
cord which you see hanging against the wall, but pain prevented my
continuing the pious exercise."

"that’s the first time i ever heard of anybody trying to cure gunshot

, for one of those
three horses is yours."

"ah, bah! which?"

"whichever of the three you like, i have no preference."

"and the rich caparison, is that mine, too?"

"without doubt."

"you laugh, d’artagnan."

"no, i have left off laughing, now that you speak french."

"what, those rich holsters, that velvet housing, that saddle studded
with silver-are they all for me?"

"for you and nobody else, as the horse which paws the ground is mine,
and the other horse, which is caracoling, belongs to athos."

"peste! they are three superb animals!"

"i am glad they please you."

"why, it must have been the king who made you such a present."

"certainly it was not the cardinal; but don’t trouble yourself whence
they come, think only that one of the three is your property."

"i choose that which the red-headed boy is leading."

"it is yours!"

"good heaven! that is enough to drive away all my pains; i could mount
him with thirty balls in my body. on my soul, handsome stirrups! hola,

rup, bazin," cried aramis; and aramis sprang into the
saddle with his usual grace and agility, but after a few vaults and
curvets of the noble animal his rider felt his pains come on so
insupportably that he turned pale and became unsteady in his seat.
d’artagnan, who, foreseeing such an event, had kept his eye on him,
sprang toward him, caught him in his arms, and assisted him to his
chamber.

"that’s all right, my dear aramis, take care of yourself," said he; "i
will go alone in search of athos."

"you are a man of brass," replied aramis.

"no, i have good luck, that is all. but how do you mean to pass your
time till i come back? no more theses, no more glosses upon the fingers
or upon benedictions, hey?"

aramis smiled. "i will make verses," said he.

"yes, i dare say; verses perfumed with the odor of the billet from the
attendant of madame de chevreuse. teach bazin prosody; that will console
him. as to the horse, ride him a little every day, and that will
accustom you to his maneuve

rs."

"oh, make yourself easy on that head," replied aramis. "you will find me
ready to follow you."

they took leave of each other, and in ten minutes, after having
commended his friend to the cares of the hostess and bazin, d’artagnan
was trotting along in the direction of amiens.

how was he going to find athos? should he find him at all? the position
in which he had left him was critical. he probably had succumbed. this
idea, while darkening his brow, drew several sighs from him, and caused
him to formulate to himself a few vows of vengeance. of all his friends,
athos was the eldest, and the least resembling him in appearance, in his
tastes and sympathies.

yet he entertained a marked preference for this gentleman. the noble and
distinguished air of athos, those flashes of greatness which from time
t

o time broke out from the shade in which he voluntarily kept himself,
that unalterable equality of temper which made him the most pleasant
companion in the world, that forced and cynical gaiety, that bravery
which might have been termed blind if it had not been the result of the
rarest coolness--such qualities attracted more than the esteem, more
than the friendship of d’artagnan; they attracted his admiration.

indeed, when placed beside m. de treville, the elegant and noble
courtier, athos in his most cheerful days might advantageously sustain a
comparison. he was of middle height; but his person was so admirably
shaped and so well proportioned that more than once in his struggles
with porthos he had overcome the giant whose physical strength was
proverbial among the musketeers. his head, with piercing eyes, a
straight nose, a chin cut like that of brutus, had altogether an
indefinable character of grandeur and grace. his hands, of which he took
little care, were the despair of a

ramis, who cultivated his with almond
paste and perfumed oil. the sound of his voice was at once penetrating
and melodious; and then, that which was inconceivable in athos, who was
always retiring, was that delicate knowledge of the world and of the
usages of the most brilliant society--those manners of a high degree
which appeared, as if unconsciously to himself, in his least actions.

if a repast were on foot, athos presided over it better than any other,
placing every guest exactly in the rank which his ancestors had earned
for him or that he had made for himself. if a question in heraldry were
started, athos knew all the noble families of the kingdom, their
genealogy, their alliances, their coats of arms, and the origin of them.
etiquette had no minutiae unknown to him. he knew what were the rights
of the great land owners. he was profoundly versed in hunting and
falconry, and had one day when conversing

 on this great art astonished
even louis xiii himself, who took a pride in being considered a past
master therein.

like all the great nobles of that period, athos rode and fenced to
perfection. but still further, his education had been so little
neglected, even with respect to scholastic studies, so rare at this time
among gentlemen, that he smiled at the scraps of latin which aramis
sported and which porthos pretended to understand. two or three times,
even, to the great astonishment of his friends, he had, when aramis
allowed some rudimental error to escape him, replaced a verb in its
right tense and a noun in its case. besides, his probity was

achable, in an age in which soldiers compromised so easily with
their religion and their consciences, lovers with the rigorous delicacy
of our era, and the poor with god’s seventh commandment. this athos,
then, was a very extraordinary man.

and yet this nature so distinguished, this creature so beautiful, this
essence so fine, was seen to turn insensibly toward material life, as
old men turn toward physical and moral imbecility. athos, in his hours
of gloom--and these hours were frequent--was extinguished as to the
whole of the luminous portion of him, and his brilliant side disappeared
as into profound darkness.

then the demigod vanished; he remained scarcely a man. his head hanging
down, his eye dull, his speech slow and painful, athos would look for
hours together at his bottle, his glass, or at grimaud, who, accustomed
to obey him by signs, read in the faint glance of his master his least
desire, and satisfied it immedi

ately. if the four friends were assembled
at one of these moments, a word, thrown forth occasionally with a
violent effort, was the share athos furnished to the conversation. in
exchange for his silence athos drank enough for four, and without
appearing to be otherwise affected by wine than by a more marked
constriction of the brow and by a deeper sadness.

d’artagnan, whose inquiring disposition we are acquainted with, had
not--whatever interest he had in satisfying his curiosity on this
subject--been able to assign any cause for these fits, or for the
periods of their recurrence. athos never received any letters; athos
never had concerns which all his friends did not know.

it could not be said 
 
 ___________________________
 
that it was wine which produced this sadness; for
in truth he only drank to combat this sadness, which wine however, as we
have said, rendered still darker. this excess of bilious humor could not
be attributed to play; for unlike porthos, who accompanied the
variations of chance with songs or oaths, athos when he won remained as
unmoved as when he lost. he had been known, in the circle of the
musketeers, to win in one night three thousand pistoles; to lose them
even to the gold-embroidered belt for gala days, win all this again with
the addition of a hundred louis, without his beautiful eyebrow being
heightened or lowered half a line, without his hands losing their pearly
hue, without his conversation, which was cheerful that evening, ceasing
to be calm and agreeable.

neither was it, as with ou
 
 ___________________________
 
r neighbors, the english, an atmospheric
influence which darkened his countenance; for the sadness generally
became more intense toward the fine season of the year. june and july
were the terrible months with athos.

for the present he had no anxiety. he shrugged his shoulders when people
spoke of the future. his secret, then, was in the past, as had often
been vaguely said to d’artagnan.

this mysterious shade, spread over his whole person, rendered still more
interesting the man whose eyes or mouth, even in the most complete
intoxication, had never revealed anything, however skillfully questions
had been put to him.

"well," thought d’artagnan, "poor athos is perhaps at this moment dead,

"alas, monseigneur, we were not in the plot, as you will soon see.
monsieur your friend (pardon for not calling him by the honorable name
which no doubt he bears, but we do not know that name), monsieur your
friend, having disabled two men with his pistols, retreated fighting
with his sword, with which he disabled one of my men, and stunned me
with a blow of the flat side of it."

"you villain, will you finish?" cried d’artagnan, "athos--what has
become of athos?"

"while fighting and retreating, as i have told monseigneur, he found the
door of the cellar stairs behind him, and as the door was open, he took
out the key, and barricaded himself inside. as we were sure of finding
him there, we left him alone."

"yes," said d’artagnan, "you did not really wish to kill; you only
wished to imprison him."

"good god! to imprison him, monseigneur? why, he imprisoned himself, i
swear to you he did. in the first place he had made roug

this disturbance he would have me hanged. it appears that i had made a
mistake, monsieur, that i had arrested the wrong person, and that he
whom i ought to have arrested had escaped."

"but athos!" cried d’artagnan, whose impatience was increased by the
disregard of the authorities, "athos, where is he?"

"as i was anxious to repair the wrongs i had done the prisoner," resumed
the innkeeper, "i took my way straight to the cellar in order to set him
at liberty. ah, monsieur, he was no longer a man, he was a devil! to my
offer of liberty, he replied that it was nothing but a snare, and that
before he came out he intended to impose his own conditions. i told him

"’in the first place,’ said he, ’i wish my lackey placed with me, fully

understand, monsieur, we were disposed to do everything your friend
could desire. monsieur grimaud (he told us his name, although he does
not talk much)--monsieur grimaud, then, went down to the cellar, wounded
as he was; then his master, having admitted him, barricaded the door
afresh, and ordered us to remain quietly in our own bar."

"but where is athos now?" cried d’artagnan. "where is athos?"

"in the cellar, monsieur."

"what, you scoundrel! have you kept him in the cellar all this time?"

"merciful heaven! no, monsieur! we keep him in the cellar! you do not
know what he is about in the cellar. ah! if you could but persuade him
to come out, monsieur, i should owe you the gratitude of my whole life;
i should adore you as my patron saint!"

"then he is there? i shall find him there?"

"without doubt you will, monsieur; he persists in remain

, you ass! could you not perceive by
our appearance that we were people of quality, and not coiners--say?"

"yes, monsieur, you are right," said the host. "but, hark, hark! there
he is!"

"somebody has disturbed him, without doubt," said d’artagnan.

"but he must be disturbed," cried the host; "here are two english
gentlemen just arrived."

"well?"

"well, the english like good wine, as you may know, monsieur; these have
asked for the best. my wife has perhaps requested permission of monsieur
athos to go into the cellar to satisfy these gentlemen; and he, as
usual, has refused. ah, good heaven! there is the hullabaloo louder than
ever!"

d’artagnan, in fact, heard a great noise on the side next the cellar. he
rose, and preceded by the host wringing his hands, and followed by
planchet with his musketoon ready for use, he approached the scene of
action.

the two gentlemen were exasperated; they had had a long ride, and were
dying with hunger and thirst.

"but this is tyranny!" cried one o

f them, in very good french, though
with a foreign accent, "that this madman will not allow these good
people access to their own wine! nonsense, let us break open the door,
and if he is too far gone in his madness, well, we will kill him!"

"softly, gentlemen!" said d’artagnan, drawing his pistols from his belt,
"you will kill nobody, if you please!"

"good, good!" cried the calm voice of athos, from the other side of the
door, "let them just come in, these devourers of little children, and we
shall see!"

brave as they appeared to be, the two english gentlemen looked at each
other hesitatingly. one might have thought there was in that cellar one
of those famished ogres--the gigantic heroes of popular legends, into
whose cavern nobody could force their way with impunity.

there was a moment of silence; but at length the two englishmen felt
ashamed to draw back, and the angrier one des

cended the five or six
steps which led to the cellar, and gave a kick against the door enough
to split a wall.

"planchet," said d’artagnan, cocking his pistols, "i will take charge of
the one at the top; you look to the one below. ah, gentlemen, you want
battle; and you shall have it."

"good god!" cried the hollow voice of athos, "i can hear d’artagnan, i
think."

"yes," cried d’artagnan, raising his voice in turn, "i am here, my
friend."

"ah, good, then," replied athos, "we will teach them, these door
breakers!"

the gentlemen had drawn their swords, but they found themselves taken
between two fires. they still hesitated an instant; but, as before,
pride prevailed, and a second kick split the door from bottom to top.

"stand on one side, d’artagnan, stand on one side," cried athos. "i am
going to fire!"

"gentlemen," exclaimed d’artagnan, whom reflection never abandoned,
"gentlemen, think of what you are about. patience, athos! you are
running your heads

into a very silly affair; you will be riddled. my
lackey and i will have three shots at you, and you will get as many from
the cellar. you will then have our swords, with which, i can assure you,
my friend and i can play tolerably well. let me conduct your business
and my own. you shall soon have something to drink; i give you my word."

"if there is any left," grumbled the jeering voice of athos.

the host felt a cold sweat creep down his back.

"how! ’if there is any left!’" murmured he.

"what the devil! there must be plenty left," replied d’artagnan. "be
satisfied of that; these two cannot have drunk all the cellar.
gentlemen, return your swords to their scabbards."

"well, provided you replace your pistols in your belt."

"willingly."

and d’artagnan set the example. then, turning toward planchet, he made
him a sign to uncock his musketoon.

the englishmen, convinced of the
 
 ___________________________
 
se peaceful proceedings, sheathed their
swords grumblingly. the history of athos’s imprisonment was then related
to them; and as they were really gentlemen, they pronounced the host in
the wrong.

"now, gentlemen," said d’artagnan, "go up to your room again; and in ten
minutes, i will answer for it, you shall have all you desire."

the englishmen bowed and went upstairs.

"now i am alone, my dear athos," said d’artagnan; "open the door, i beg
of you."

"instantly," said athos.

then was heard a great noise of fagots being removed and of the groaning
of posts; these were the counterscarps and bastions of athos, which the
besieged himself demolished.

an instant after, the broken door was removed, and the pale face of
athos appeared, who with a rapid glance took a survey of the
surroundings.

d’artagnan threw himself on his neck and embraced him tenderly. he then
tried to draw him from his moist abode, but to his surprise he perceived
that athos staggered.

"you are

ken satyrs in the pictures of rubens. he was moistened before and
behind with a greasy liquid which the host recognized as his best olive
oil.

the four crossed the public room and proceeded to take possession of the
best apartment in the house, which d’artagnan occupied with authority.

in the meantime the host and his wife hurried down with lamps into the
cellar, which had so long been interdicted to them and where a frightful
spectacle awaited them.

beyond the fortifications through which athos had made a breach in order
to get out, and which were composed of fagots, planks, and empty casks,
heaped up according to all the rules of the strategic art, they found,
swimming in puddles of oil and wine, the bones and fragments of all the
hams they had eaten; while a heap of broken bottles filled the whole
left-hand corner of the cellar, and a tun, the cock of which was left
running, was yielding, by this means, the last drop of its blood. "the
image of devastation and death," as the ancient

 poet says, "reigned as

of fifty large sausages, suspended from the joists, scarcely ten
remained.

then the lamentations of the host and hostess pierced the vault of the
cellar. d’artagnan himself was moved by them. athos did not even turn
his head.

to grief succeeded rage. the host armed himself with a spit, and rushed
into the chamber occupied by the two friends.

"some wine!" said athos, on perceiving the host.

"some wine!" cried the stupefied host, "some wine? why you have drunk
more than a hundred pistoles’ worth! i am a ruined man, lost,
destroyed!"

"bah," said athos, "we were always dry."

"if you had been contented with drinking, well and good; but you have
broken all the bottles."

"you pushed me upon a heap which rolled down. that was your fault."

"all my oil is lost!"

"oil is a sovereign balm for wounds; and my poor grimaud here was
obliged to dress those you had

 inflicted on him."

"all my sausages are gnawed!"

"there is an enormous quantity of rats in that cellar."

"you shall pay me for all this," cried the exasperated host.

"triple ass!" said athos, rising; but he sank down again immediately. he
had tried his strength to the utmost. d’artagnan came to his relief with
his whip in his hand.

the host drew back and burst into tears.

"this will teach you," said d’artagnan, "to treat the guests god sends
you in a more courteous fashion."

"god? say the devil!"

"my dear friend," said d’artagnan, "if you annoy us in this manner we
will all four go and shut ourselves up in your cellar, and we will see
if the mischief is as great as you sa

y."

"oh, gentlemen," said the host, "i have been wrong. i confess it, but
pardon to every sin! you are gentlemen, and i am a poor innkeeper. you
will have pity on me."

"ah, if you speak in that way," said athos, "you will break my heart,
and the tears will flow from my eyes as the wine flowed from the cask.
we are not such devils as we appear to be. come hither, and let us
talk."

the host approached with hesitation.

"come hither, i say, and don’t be afraid," continued athos. "at the very
moment when i was about to pay you, i had placed my purse on the table."

"yes, monsieur."

"that purse contained sixty pistoles; where is it?"

"deposited with the justice; they said it was bad money."

"very well; get me my purse back and keep the sixty pistoles."

"but monseigneur knows very well that justice never lets go that which
it once lays hold of. if it were bad money, there might be some hopes;
but unfortunately, those were all good pieces."

"manage the matter as well

 as you can, my good man; it does not concern
me, the more so as i have not a livre left."

"come," said d’artagnan, "let us inquire further. athos’s horse, where
is that?"

"in the stable."

"how much is it worth?"

"fifty pistoles at most."

"it’s worth eighty. take it, and there ends the matter."

"what," cried athos, "are you selling my horse--my bajazet? and pray
upon what shall i make my campaign; upon grimaud?"

"i have brought you another," said d’artagnan.

"another?"

"and a magnificent one!" cried the host.

"well, since there is another finer and younger, why, you may take the
old one; and let us drink."

"what?" asked the host, quite cheerful again.

"some of that at the bottom, near the laths. there are twenty-five
bottles of it left; all the rest were broken by my fall. bring six of
them."

"w

hy, this man is a cask!" said the host, aside. "if he only remains
here a fortnight, and pays for what he drinks, i shall soon re-establish
my business."

"and don’t forget," said d’artagnan, "to bring up four bottles of the
same sort for the two english gentlemen."

"and now," said athos, "while they bring the wine, tell me, d’artagnan,
what has become of the others, come!"

d’artagnan related how he had found porthos in bed with a strained knee,
and aramis at a table between two theologians. as he finished, the host
entered with the wine ordered and a ham which, fortunately for him, had
been left out of the cellar.

"that’s well!" said athos, filling his glass and that of his friend;
"here’s to porthos and aramis! but you, d’artagnan, what is the matter
with you, and
 
 ___________________________
 
 what has happened to you personally? you have a sad air."

"alas," said d’artagnan, "it is because i am the most unfortunate."

"tell me."

"presently," said d’artagnan.

"presently! and why presently? because you think i am drunk? d’artagnan,
remember this! my ideas are never so clear as when i have had plenty of
wine. speak, then, i am all ears."

d’artagnan related his adventure with mme. bonacieux. athos listened to
him without a frown; and when he had finished, said, "trifles, only
trifles!" that was his favorite word.

"you always say trifles, my dear athos!" said d’artagnan, "and that come
very ill from you, who have never loved."

the drink-deadened eye of athos flashed out, but only for a moment; it
became as dull and vacant as before.

"that’s true," said he, quietly, "for my part i have never loved."

"acknowledge, then, you stony heart," said d’artagnan, "that you are
wrong to be 
 
 ___________________________
 
so hard upon us tender hearts."

"tender hearts! pierced hearts!" said athos.

"what do you say?"

"i say that love is a lottery in which he who wins, wins death! you are
very fortunate to have lost, believe me, my dear d’artagnan. and if i
have any counsel to give, it is, always lose!"

"she seemed to love me so!"

"she seemed, did she?"

"oh, she did love me!"

"you child, why, there is not a man who has not believed, as you do,
that his mistress loved him, and there lives not a man who has not been
deceived by his mistress."

"except you, athos, who never had one."
 
 ___________________________
 


"that’s true," said athos, after a moment’s silence, "that’s true! i
never had one! let us drink!"

"but then, philosopher that you are," said d’artagnan, "instruct me,
support me. i stand in need of being taught and consoled."

"consoled for what?"

"for my misfortune."

"your misfortune is laughable," said athos, shrugging his shoulders; "i
should like to know what you would say if i were to relate to you a real
tale of love!"

"which has happened to you?"

"or one of my friends, what matters?"

"tell it, athos, tell it."

"better if i drink."

"drink and relate, then."

"not a bad idea!" said athos, emptying and refilling his glass. "the two
things agree marvelously well."

"i am all attention," said d’artagnan.

athos collected himself, and in proportion as he did so, d’artagnan saw
that he becam

vulgar drinkers fall on the floor and go to sleep. he kept himself
upright and dreamed, without sleeping. this somnambulism of drunkenness
had something frightful in it.

"you particularly wish it?" asked he.

"i pray for it," said d’artagnan.

"be it then as you desire. one of my friends--one of my friends, please
to observe, not myself," said athos, interrupting himself with a
melancholy smile, "one of the counts of my province--that is to say, of

an honorable man; he married her. the fool! the ass! the idiot!"

"how so, if he love her?" asked d’artagnan.

"wait," said athos. "he took her to his chateau, and made her the first
lady in the province; and in justice it must be allowed that she
supported her rank becomingly."

"well?" asked d’artagnan.

"well, one day when she was hunting with her husband," continued athos,
in a low voice, and speaking very quickly, "she fell from her horse and
fainted. the count flew to her to help, and as she appeared to be
oppressed by her clothes, he ripped them open with his poniard, and in
so doing laid bare her shoulder. d’a

maniacal burst of laughter, "guess what she had on her shoulder."

"how can i tell?" said d’artagnan.

"a fleur-de-lis," said athos. "she was branded."

athos emptied at a single draught the glass he held in his hand.

"horror!" cried d’artagnan. "what do you tell me?"

"truth, my friend. the angel was a demon; the poor young girl had stolen
the sacred vessels from a church."

"and what did the count do?"

"the count was of the highest nobility. he had on his estates the rights
of high and low tribunals. he tore the dress of the countess to pieces;
he tied her hands behind her, and hanged her on a tree."

"heavens, athos, a murder?" cried d’artag

nan.

"no less," said athos, as pale as a corpse. "but methinks i need wine!"
and he seized by the neck the last bottle that was left, put it to his
mouth, and emptied it at a single draught, as he would have emptied an
ordinary glass.

then he let his head sink upon his two hands, while d’artagnan stood
before him, stupefied.

"that has cured me of beautiful, poetical, and loving women," said
athos, after a considerable pause, raising his head, and forgetting to
continue the fiction of the count. "god grant you as much! let us
drink."

"then she is dead?" stammered d’artagnan.

"parbleu!" said athos. "but hold out your glass. some ham, my boy, or we
can’t drink."

"and her brother?" added d’artagnan, timidly.

"her brother?" replied athos.

"yes, the priest."

"oh, i inquired after him for the purpose of hanging him likewise; but
he was beforehand with me, he had quit the curacy the

 night before."

"was it ever known who this miserable fellow was?"

"he was doubtless the first lover and accomplice of the fair lady. a
worthy man, who had pretended to be a curate for the purpose of getting
his mistress married, and securing her a position. he has been hanged
and quartered, i hope."

"my god, my god!" cried d’artagnan, quite stunned by the relation of
this horrible adventure.

"taste some of this ham, d’artagnan; it is exquisite," said athos,
cutting a slice, which he placed on the young man’s plate.

"what a pity it is there were only four like this in the cellar. i could
have drunk fifty bottles more."

d’artagnan could no longer endure this conversation, which had made him
bewildered. allowing his head to sink upon his two hands, he pretended
to sleep.

"these young fellows can none of them drink," said athos, looking at him
with pity, "and yet this is one of the best!"




28 the return


d’artagnan was astounded by the t
 
 ___________________________
 
errible confidence of athos; yet many
things appeared very obscure to him in this half revelation. in the
first place it had been made by a man quite drunk to one who was half
drunk; and yet, in spite of the incertainty which the vapor of three or
four bottles of burgundy carries with it to the brain, d’artagnan, when
awaking on the following morning, had all the words of athos as present
to his memory as if they then fell from his mouth--they had been so
impressed upon his mind. all this doubt only gave rise to a more lively
desire of arriving at a certainty, and he went into his friend’s chamber
with a fixed determination of renewing the conversation of the preceding
evening; but he found athos quite himself again--that is to say, the
most shrewd and impenetrable of men. besides which, the musketeer, after
having exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with him, broa

er that i uttered a thousand
extravagances."

while saying this he looked at his friend with an earnestness that
embarrassed him.

"no," replied d’artagnan, "if i recollect well what you said, it was
nothing out of the common way."

"ah, you surprise me. i thought i had told you a most lamentable story."
and he looked at the young man as if he would read the bottom of his
heart.

"my faith," said d’artagnan, "it appears that i was more drunk than you,
since i remember nothing of the kind."

athos did not trust this reply, and he resumed; "you cannot have failed
to remark, my dear friend, that everyone has his particular kind of
drunkenness, sad or gay. my drunkenness is always sad, and when i am
thoroughly drunk my mania is to relate all the lugubrious stories which
my foolish nurse inculcated into my brain. that is my failing--a capital
failing, i admit; but with that exception, i am a good drinker."

athos spoke this in so natural a manner that d’artagnan was shaken in
his convictio

n.

"it is that, then," replied the young man, anxious to find out the
truth, "it is that, then, i remember as we remember a dream. we were
speaking of hanging."

"ah, you see how it is," said athos, becoming still paler, but yet
attempting to laugh; "i was sure it was so--the hanging of people is my
nightmare."

"yes, yes," replied d’artagnan. "i remember now; yes, it was about--stop
a minute--yes, it was about a woman."

"that’s it," replied athos, becoming almost livid; "that is my grand
story of the fair lady, and when i relate that, i must be very drunk."

"yes, that was it," said d’artagnan, "the story of a tall, fair lady,
with blue eyes."

"yes, who was hanged."

"by her husband, who was a nobleman of your acquaintance," continued
d’artagnan, looking intently at athos.

"well, you see how a man may compromise himself when he does not know
what he says," replied athos, shrugging his shoulders as if he thought
himself an object o

f pity. "i certainly never will get drunk again,
d’artagnan; it is too bad a habit."

d’artagnan remained silent; and then changing the conversation all at
once, athos said:

"by the by, i thank you for the horse you have brought me."

"is it to your mind?" asked d’artagnan.

"yes; but it is not a horse for hard work."

"you are mistaken; i rode him nearly ten leagues in less than an hour
and a half, and he appeared no more distressed than if he had only made
the tour of the place st. sulpice."

"ah, you begin to awaken my regret."

"regret?"

"yes; i have parted with him."

"how?"

"why, here is the simple fact. this morning i awoke at six o’clock. you

’my good gentleman, i have a horse to sell, too.’ ’ay, and a very fine
one! i saw him yesterday; your friend’s lackey was leading him.’ ’do you
think he is worth a hundred pistoles?’ ’yes! will you sell him to me for
that sum?’ ’no; but i will play for him.’ ’what?’ ’at dice.’ no sooner
said than done, and i lost the horse. ah, ah! but please to observe i
won back the equipage," cried athos.

d’artagnan looked much disconcerted.

"this vexes you?" said athos.

"well, i must confess it does," replied d’artagnan. "that horse was to
have identified us in the day of battle. it was a pledge, a remembrance.
athos, you have done wrong."

"but, my dear friend, put yourself in my place," replied the musketeer.
"i was hipped to death; and still further, upon my honor, i don’t like
english horses. if it is only to be recognized, why the saddle will
suffice for that; it is quite remarka

ble enough. as to the horse, we can
easily find some excuse for its disappearance. why the devil! a horse is
mortal; suppose mine had had the glanders or the farcy?"

d’artagnan did not smile.

"it vexes me greatly," continued athos, "that you attach so much
importance to these animals, for i am not yet at the end of my story."

"what else have you done."

"after having lost my own horse, nine against ten--see how near--i
formed an idea of staking yours."

"yes; but you stopped at the idea, i hope?"

"no; for i put it in execution that very minute."

"and the consequence?" said d’artagnan, in great anxiety.

"i threw, and i lost."

"what, my horse?"

"your horse, seven against eight; a point short--you know the proverb."

"athos, you are not in your right senses, i swear."

"my dear lad, that was yesterday, when i was telling you silly stories,
it was proper to tell me that, and not this morning. i lost him then,
with all his appointments and furniture."

"really, this is frightful."

"stop a minute; you don’t know all yet. i should make an excellent
gambler if i were not too hot-headed; but i was hot-headed, just as if i
had been drinking. well, i was not hot-headed then--"

"well, but what else could you play for?

, and which i had observed yesterday."

"this diamond!" said d’artagnan, placing his hand eagerly on his ring.

"and as i am a connoisseur in such things, having had a few of my own
once, i estimated it at a thousand pistoles."

"i hope," said d’artagnan, half dead with fright, "you made no mention
of my diamond?"

"on the contrary, my dear friend, this diamond became our only resource;
with it i might regain our horses and their harnesses, and even money to
pay our expenses on the road."

"athos, you make me tremble!" cried d’artagnan.

"i mentioned your diamond then to my adversary, who had likewise
remarked it. what the devil, my dear, do you think you can wear a star
from heaven on your finger, and nobody observe it? impossible!"

"go on, go on, my dear fellow!" said d’artagnan; "for upon my honor, you
will kill me with your indifference."

"we divided, then, this diamond into ten parts of a hundred pistoles
each."

"you are laughing at me, and want to try me!" said d’artagnan

any of bottles."

"that was no reason for staking my diamond!" replied d’artagnan, closing
his hand with a nervous spasm.

"hear the end. ten parts of a hundred pistoles each, in ten throws,
without revenge; in thirteen throws i had lost all--in thirteen throws.
the number thirteen was always fatal to me; it was on the thirteenth of
july that--"

"ventrebleu!" cried d’artagnan, rising from the table, the story of the
present day making him forget that of the preceding one.

"patience!" said athos; "i had a plan. the englishman was an original; i
had seen him conversing that morning with grimaud, and grimaud had told
me that he had made him proposals to enter into his service. i staked
grimaud, the silent grimaud, divided into ten portions."

"well, what next?" said d’artagnan, laughing in spite of himself.

"grimaud himself, understand; and with the ten parts of grimaud, which
are not worth a ducatoon, i regained the diamond. tell me, now, if
persistence is not a virtue?"

"my faith!

 back your harness, then your horse, then my harness, then my
horse, and then i lost again. in brief, i regained your harness and then
mine. that’s where we are. that was a superb throw, so i left off
there."

d’artagnan breathed as if the whole hostelry had been removed from his
breast.

"then the diamond is safe?" said he, timidly.

"intact, my dear friend; besides the harness of your bucephalus and
mine."

"but what is the use of harnesses without horses?"

"i have an idea about them."

"athos, you make me shudder."

"listen to me. you have not played for a long time, d’artagnan."

"and i have no inclination to play."

"swear to nothing. you have not played for a long time, i said; you
ought, then, to have a good hand."

"well, what then?"

"well; the englishman and his companion are still here. i remarked that
he regretted the horse furniture very much. you appear to think much of
your horse. in your place i would stake the furniture against the
horse."

"but he will not wish for

only one harness."

"stake both, pardieu! i am not selfish, as you are."

"you would do so?" said d’artagnan, undecided, so strongly did the
confidence of athos begin to prevail, in spite of himself.

"on my honor, in one single throw."

"but having lost the horses, i am particularly anxious to preserve the
harnesses."

"stake your diamond, then."

"this? that’s another matter. never, never!"

"the devil!" said athos. "i would propose to you to stake planchet, but
as that has already been done, the englishman would not, perhaps, be
willing."

"decidedly, my dear athos," said d’artagnan, "i should like better not
to risk anything."

"that’s a pity," said athos, coolly. "the englishman is overflowing with
pistoles. good lord, try one throw! one throw is soon made!"

"and if i lose?"

"you will win."

"but if i lose?"

"well, you will surrender the harnesses."

"have with you for one throw!" said d’artag

nan.

athos went in quest of the englishman, whom he found in the stable,
examining the harnesses with a greedy eye. the opportunity was good. he
proposed the conditions--the two harnesses, either against one horse or
a hundred pistoles. the englishman calculated fast; the two harnesses
were worth three hundred pistoles. he consented.

d’artagnan threw the dice with a trembling hand, and turned up the
number three; his paleness terrified athos, who, however, consented
himself with saying, "that’s a sad throw, comrade; you will have the
horses fully equipped, monsieur."

the englishman, quite triumphant, did not even give himself the trouble
to shake the dice. he threw them on the table without looking at them,
so sure was he of victory; d’artagnan turned aside to conceal his ill
humor.

"hold, hold, hold!" said athos, wit his quiet tone; "that throw of the
dice is extraordinary. i have not seen such a one four times in my life.

the englishman looked, and was seized with astonishment. d’artagnan
looked, and was seized with pleasure.

"yes," continued athos, "four times only; once at the house of monsieur
crequy; another time at my own house in the country, in my chateau
at--when i had a chateau; a third time at monsieur de treville’s where
it surprised us all; and the fourth time at a cabaret, where it fell to
my lot, and where i lost a hundred louis and a supper on it."

"then monsieur takes his horse back again," said the englishman.

"certainly," said d’artagnan.

"then there is no revenge?"

"our conditions said, ’no revenge,’ you wil

"that is true; the horse shall be restored to your lackey, monsieur."

"a moment," said athos; "with your permission, monsieur, i wish to speak
a word with my friend."

"say on."

athos drew d’artagnan aside.

"well, tempter, what more do you want with me?" said d’artagnan. "you
want me to throw again, do you not?"

"no, i would wish you to reflect."

"on what?"

"you mean to take your horse?"

"without doubt."

"you are wrong, then. i would take the hundred pistoles. you know you
have staked the harnesses against the horse or a hundred pistoles, at
your choice."

"yes."

"well, then, i repeat, you are wrong. what is the use of one horse for
us two? i could not ride behind

. we should look like the two sons of
anmon, who had lost their brother. you cannot think of humiliating me by
prancing along by my side on that magnificent charger. for my part, i
should not hesitate a moment; i should take the hundred pistoles. we
want money for our return to paris."

"i am much attached to that horse, athos."

"and there again you are wrong. a horse slips and injures a joint; a
horse stumbles and breaks his knees to the bone; a horse eats out of a
manger in which a glandered horse has eaten. there is a horse, while on
the contrary, the hundred pistoles feed their master."

"but how shall we get back?"

"upon our lackey’s horses, pardieu. anybody may see by our bearing that
we are people of condition."

"pretty figures we shall cut on ponies while aramis and porthos caracole
on their steeds."

"a

ramis! porthos!" cried athos, and laughed aloud.

"what is it?" asked d’artagnan, who did not at all comprehend the
hilarity of his friend.

"nothing, nothing! go on!"

"your advice, then?"

"to take the hundred pistoles, d’artagnan. with the hundred pistoles we
can live well to the end of the month. we have undergone a great deal of
fatigue, remember, and a little rest will do no harm."

"i rest? oh, no, athos. once in paris, i shall prosecute my search for
that unfortunate woman!"

"well, you may be assured that your horse will not be half so
serviceable to you for that purpose as good golden louis. take the
hundred pistoles, my friend; take the hundred pistoles!"

d’artagnan only required one reason to be satisfied. this last reason
appeared convincing. besides, he feared that by resisting longer he
should appear selfish in the eyes of athos. he acquiesced, therefore,
and chose the hundred pistol

es, which the englishman paid down on the
spot.

they then determined to depart. peace with the landlord, in addition to
athos’s old horse, cost six pistoles. d’artagnan and athos took the nags
of planchet and grimaud, and the two lackeys started on foot, carrying
the saddles on their heads.

however ill our two friends were mounted, they were soon far in advance
of their servants, and arrived at creveccoeur. from a distance they
perceived aramis, seated in a melancholy manner at his window, looking
out, like sister anne, at the dust in the horizon.

"hola, aramis! what the devil are you doing there?" cried the two
friends.

"ah, is that you, d’artagnan, and you, athos

n the rapidity with which the blessings of this world
leave us. my english horse, which has just disappeared amid a cloud of
dust, has furnished me with a living image of the fragility of the
things of the earth. life itself may be resolved into three words: erat,
est, fuit."

"which means--" said d’artagnan, who began to suspect the truth.

"which means that i have just been duped-sixty louis for a horse which
by the manner of his gait can do at least five leagues an hour."

d’artagnan and athos laughed aloud.

"my dear d’artagnan," said aramis, "don’t be too angry with me, i beg.
necessity has no law; besides, i am the person punished, as that
rascally horsedealer has robbed me of fifty louis, at least. ah, you
fellows are good managers! you ride on our lackey’s horses, and have
your own gallant steeds led along carefully by hand, at short stages."

at the same instant a market cart, which some minutes before had
appeared upon the amiens road, pulled up at the inn, and planchet

and
grimaud came out of it with the saddles on their heads. the cart was
returning empty to paris, and the two lackeys had agreed, for their
transport, to slake the wagoner’s thirst along the route.

"what is this?" said aramis, on seeing them arrive. "nothing but
saddles?"

"now do you understand?" said athos.

"my friends, that’s exactly like me! i retained my harness by instinct.
hola, bazin! bring my new saddle and carry it along with those of these
gentlemen."

"and what have you done with your ecclesiastics?" asked d’artagnan.

"my dear fellow, i invited them to a dinner the next day," replied
aramis. "they have some capital wine here--please to observe that in
passing. i did my best to make them drunk. then the curate forbade me to
quit my uniform, and the jesuit entreated me to get him ma

dressed, choice wines, and superb fruit.

"ah, pardieu!" said he, rising, "you come in the nick of time,
gentlemen. i was just beginning the soup, and you will dine with me."

"oh, oh!" said d’artagnan, "mousqueton has not caught these bottles with
his lasso. besides, here is a piquant fricandeau and a fillet of beef."

"i am recruiting myself," said porthos, "i am recruiting myself. nothing
weakens a man more than these devilish strains. did you ever suffer from
a strain, athos?"

"never! though i remember, in our affair of the rue ferou, i received a
sword wound which at the end of fifteen or eighteen days produced the
same effect."

"but this dinner was not intended for you alone, porthos?" said aramis.

"no," said porthos, "i expected some gentlemen of the neighborhood, who
have just sent me word they could not come. you will take their places
and i shall not lose by the exchange. hola, mousqueton, seats, and order
double the bottles!"

"do you know what we are eat

minutes.

"pardieu!" replied d’artagnan, "for my part, i am eating veal garnished
with shrimps and vegetables."

"and i some lamb chops," said porthos.

"and i a plain chicken," said aramis.

"you are all mistaken, gentlemen," answered athos, gravely; "you are
eating horse."

"eating what?" said d’artagnan.

"horse!" said aramis, with a grimace of disgust.

porthos alone made no reply.

"yes, horse. are we not eating a horse, porthos? and perhaps his saddle,
therewith."

"no, gentlemen, i have kept the harness," said porthos.

"my faith," said aramis, "we are all alike. one would think we had
tipped the wink."

"what could i do?" said porthos. "this horse made my visitors ashamed of
theirs, and i don’t like to humiliate people.

ters?" asked d’artagnan.

"still," replied porthos. "and, my faith, the governor of the
province--one of the gentlemen i expected today--seemed to have such a
wish for him, that i gave him to him."

"gave him?" cried d’artagnan.

"my god, yes, gave, that is the word," said porthos; "for the animal was
worth at least a hundred and fifty louis, and the stingy fellow would
only give me eighty."

"without the saddle?" said aramis.

"yes, without the saddle."

"you will observe, gentlemen," said athos, "that porthos has made the
best bargain of any of us."

and then commenced a roar of laughter in which they all joined, to the
astonishment of poor porthos; but when he was informed of the cause of
their hilarity, he shared it vociferously according to his custom.

"there is one comfort, we are all in cash," said d’artagnan.

"well, for my part," said athos, "i found aramis’s spanish wine so good
that i sent on a hamper of sixty bottles of it in the wagon with the
lackeys. that has weakene

tlemen, which will be said, gentlemen, for which
i have not the least doubt you will be marvelously benefited."

"and i," said porthos, "do you think my strain cost me nothing?--without
reckoning mousqueton’s wound, for which i had to have the surgeon twice
a day, and who charged me double on account of that foolish mousqueton
having allowed himself a ball in a part which people generally only show
to an apothecary; so i advised him to try never to get wounded there any
more."

"ay, ay!" said athos, exchanging a smile with d’artagnan and aramis, "it
is very clear you acted nobly with regard to the poor lad; that is like
a good master."

"in short," said porthos, "when all my expenses are paid, i shall have,
at most, thirty crowns left."

"and i about ten pistoles," said aramis.

"well, then it appears that we are the croesuses of the society. how
much have you left of your hundred pistoles, d’artagnan?"

"of my hundred pistoles? why, in the first place i gave you fifty."

"you think s

"pardieu!" "ah, that is true. i recollect."

"then i paid the host six."

"what a brute of a host! why did you give him six pistoles?"

"you told me to give them to him."

"it is true; i am too good-natured. in brief, how much remains?"

"twenty-five pistoles," said d’artagnan.

"and i," said athos, taking some small change from his pocket, "i--"

"you? nothing!"

"my faith! so little that it is not worth reckoning with the general
stock."

"now, then, let us calculate how much we posses in all."

"porthos?"

"thirty crowns."

"aramis?"

"ten pistoles."

"and you, d’artagnan?"

"twenty-five."

"that makes in all?" said athos.

"four hundred and seventy-five livres," said d’artagnan, who reckoned
like archimedes.

ng in paris, d’artagnan found a letter from m. de treville,
which informed him that, at his request, the king had promised that he
should enter the company of the musketeers.

as this was the height of d’artagnan’s worldly ambition--apart, be it
well understood, from his desire of finding mme. bonacieux--he ran, full
of joy, to seek his comrades, whom he had left only half an hour before,
but whom he found very sad and deeply preoccupied. they were assembled
in council at the residence of athos, which always indicated an event of
some gravity. m. de treville had intimated to them his majesty’s fixed
intention to open the campaign on the first of may, and they must
immediately prepare their outfits.

the four philosophers looked at one another in a state of bewilderment.
m. de treville never jested in matters relating to discipline.

"and what do you reckon your outfit will cost?" said d’artagnan.

"oh, we can scarcely say. we have made our calculations with spartan
economy, and we
 
 ___________________________
 
 each require fifteen hundred livres."

"four times fifteen makes sixty--six thousand livres," said athos.

"it seems to me," said d’artagnan, "with a thousand livres each--i do
not speak as a spartan, but as a procurator--"

this word procurator roused porthos. "stop," said he, "i have an idea."

"well, that’s something, for i have not the shadow of one," said athos
coolly; "but as to d’artagnan, gentlemen, the idea of belonging to ours
has driven him out of his senses. a thousand livres! for my part, i
declare i want two thousand."

"four times two makes eight," then said aramis; "it is eight thousand
that we want to complete our outfits, toward which, it is true, we have
already the saddles."

"besides," said athos, waiting till d’artagnan, who went to thank
monsieur de treville, had shut the door, "besides, there is that

so vain as almost to rival porthos. to this preoccupation of his vanity,
d’artagnan at this moment joined an uneasiness much less selfish.
notwithstanding all his inquiries respecting mme. bonacieux, he could
obtain no intelligence of her. m. de treville had spoken of her to the
queen. the queen was ignorant where the mercer’s young wife was, but had
promised to have her sought for; but this promise was very vague and did
not at all reassure d’artagnan.

athos did not leave his chamber; he made up his mind not to take a
single step to equip himself.

"we have still fifteen days before us," said he to his friends, "well,
if at the end of a fortnight i have found nothing, or rather if nothing
has come to find me, as i, too good a catholic to kill myself with a
pistol bullet, i will seek a good quarrel with four of his eminence’s
guards or with eight englishmen, and i will fight until one of them has
killed me, which, considering the number, cannot fa

the lackeys on their part, like the coursers of hippolytus, shared the
sadness of their masters. mousqueton collected a store of crusts; bazin,
who had always been inclined to devotion, never quit the churches;
planchet watched the flight of flies; and grimaud, whom the general
distress could not induce to break the silence imposed by his master,
heaved sighs enough to soften the stones.

the three friends--for, as we have said, athos had sworn not to stir a
foot to equip himself--went out early in the morning, and returned late
at night. they wandered about the streets, looking at the pavement as if
to see whether the passengers had not left a purse behind them. they
might have been supposed to be following tracks, so observant were they
wherever they went. when they met they looked desolately at one another,
as much as to say, "have you found anything?"

it was useless to try to keep pace on foot with a carriage drawn by two
powerful horses. d’artagnan therefore returned to the rue ferou.

in the rue de seine he met planchet, who had stopped before the house of
a pastry cook, and was contemplating with ecstasy a cake of the most
appetizing appearance.

he ordered him to go and saddle two horses in m. de treville’s
stables--one for himself, d’artagnan, and one for planchet--and bring
them to athos’s place. once for all, treville had placed his stable at
d’artagnan’s service.

planchet proceeded toward the rue du colombier, and d’artagnan toward
the rue ferou. athos was at home, emptying sadly a bottle of the famous
spanish wine he had brought back with him from his journey into picardy.
he made a sign for grimaud to bring a glass for d’artagnan, and grimaud
obeyed as usual.

d’artagnan related to athos all that had passed at the church between
porthos and the procurator’s w

ife, and how their comrade was probably by
that time in a fair way to be equipped.

"as for me," replied athos to this recital, "i am quite at my ease; it
will not be women that will defray the expense of my outfit."

"handsome, well-bred, noble lord as you are, my dear athos, neither
princesses nor queens would be secure from your amorous solicitations."

"how young this d’artagnan is!" said athos, shrugging his shoulders; and
he made a sign to grimaud to bring another bottle.

at that moment planchet put his head modestly in at the half-open door,
and told his master that the horses were ready.

"what horses?" asked athos.

"two horses that monsieur de treville lends me at my pleasure, and with
which i am now going to take a ride to st. germain."

"well, and what are you going to do at st. germain?" then demanded
athos.

then d’artagnan described the meeting which he had at the church

, and
how he had found that lady who, with the seigneur in the black cloak and
with the scar near his temple, filled his mind constantly.

"that is to say, you are in love with this lady as you were with madame
bonacieux," said athos, shrugging his shoulders contemptuously, as if he
pitied human weakness.

"i? not at all!" said d’artagnan. "i am only curious to unravel the
mystery to which she is attached. i do not know why, but i imagine that
this woman, wholly unknown to me as she is, and wholly unknown to her as
i am, has an influence over my life."

"well, perhaps you are right," said athos. "i do not know a woman that
is worth the trouble of being sought for when she is once lost. madame
bonacieux is lost; so much th

e worse for her if she is found."

"no, athos, no, you are mistaken," said d’artagnan; "i love my poor
constance more than ever, and if i knew the place in which she is, were
it at the end of the world, i would go to free her from the hands of her
enemies; but i am ignorant. all my researches have been useless. what is
to be said? i must divert my attention!"

"amuse yourself with milady, my dear d’artagnan; i wish you may with all
my heart, if that will amuse you."

"hear me, athos," said d’artagnan. "instead of shutting yourself up here
as if you were under arrest, get on horseback and come and take a ride
with me to st. germain."

"my dear fellow," said athos, "i ride horses when i have any; when i
have none, i go afoot."

"well," said d’artagnan, smiling at the misanthropy of athos, which from
any other person would have offended him, "i ride what i can get; i am
not so proud as you. so au revoir, dear athos."

"au revoir," said the musketeer, making a sign to grim

aud to uncork the
bottle he had just brought.

d’artagnan and planchet mounted, and took the road to st. germain.

all along the road, what athos had said respecting mme. bonacieux
recurred to the mind of the young man. although d’artagnan was not of a
very sentimental character, the mercer’s pretty wife had made a real
impression upon his heart. as he said, he was ready to go to the end of
the world to seek her; but the world, being round, has many ends, so
that he did not know which way to turn. meantime, he was going to try to
find out milady. milady had spoken to the man in the black cloak;
therefore she knew him. now, in the opi

on--home!"

the pretty soubrette cast an anxious glance at d’artagnan, whose good
looks seemed to have made an impression on her.

the carriage went on, and left the two men facing each other; no
material obstacle separated them.

the cavalier made a movement as if to follow the carriage; but
d’artagnan, whose anger, already excited, was much increased by
recognizing in him the englishman of amiens who had won his horse and
had been very near winning his diamond of athos, caught at his bridle
and stopped him.

"well, monsieur," said he, "you appear to be more stupid than i am, for
you forget there is a little quarrel to arrange between us two."

"ah," said the englishman, "is it you, my master? it seems you must
always be playing some game or other."

"yes; and that reminds me that i have a revenge to take. we will see, my
dear monsieur, if you can handle a sword as skillfully as you can a dice
box."

"you see plainly that i have no sword," said the englishman.

 just my number!"

"now, then, who are you?" asked the englishman.

"i am monsieur d’artagnan, a gascon gentleman, serving in the king’s
musketeers. and you?"

"i am lord de winter, baron sheffield."

"well, then, i am your servant, monsieur baron," said d’artagnan,
"though you have names rather difficult to recollect." and touching his
horse with the spur, he cantered back to paris. as he was accustomed to
do in all cases of any consequence, d’artagnan went straight to the
residence of athos.

he found athos reclining upon a large sofa, where he was waiting, as he
said, for his outfit to come and find him. he related to athos all that
had passed, except the letter to m. de wardes.

athos was delighted to find he was going to fight an englishman. we
might say that was his dream.

they immediately sent their lackeys for porthos and aramis, and on their
arrival made them acquainted with the situation.

porthos drew his sword from the scabbard, and made passes at the wall,
springing ba

ck from time to time, and making contortions like a dancer.

aramis, who was constantly at work at his poem, shut himself up in
athos’s closet, and begged not to be disturbed before the moment of
drawing swords.

athos, by signs, desired grimaud to bring another bottle of wine.

d’artagnan employed himself in arranging a little plan, of which we
shall hereafter see the execution, and which promised him some agreeable
adventure, as might be seen by the smiles which from time to time passed
over his countenance, whose thoughtfulness they animated.




31 english and french


the hour having come, they went with their four lackeys to a spot behind
the luxembourg given up to the feeding of goats. athos threw a

osure, entered, and joined
the musketeers. then, according to foreign custom, the presentations
took place.

the englishmen were all men of rank; consequently the odd names of their
adversaries were for them not only a matter of surprise, but of
annoyance.

"but after all," said lord de winter, when the three friends had been
named, "we do not know who you are. we cannot fight with such names;
they are names of shepherds."

"therefore your lordship may suppose they are only assumed names," said
athos.

"which only gives us a greater desire to know the real ones," replied
the englishman.

"you played very willingly with us without knowing our names," said
athos, "by the same token that you won our horses."

"that is true, but we then only risked our pistoles; this time we risk
our blood. one plays with anybody; but one fights only with equals."

"and that is but just," said athos, and he took aside the one of the
four englishmen with whom he was to fight, and communicated his name in
a low v

oice.

porthos and aramis did the same.

"does that satisfy you?" said athos to his adversary. "do you find me of
sufficient rank to do me the honor of crossing swords with me?"

"yes, monsieur," said the englishman, bowing.

"well! now shall i tell you something?" added athos, coolly.

"what?" replied the englishman.

"why, that is that you would have acted much more wisely if you had not
required me to make myself known."

"why so?"

"because i am believed to be dead, and have reasons for wishing nobody
to know i am living; so that i shall be obliged to kill you to prevent
my secret from roaming over the fields."

the englishman looked at athos, believing that he jested, but athos did
not jest the least in the world.

"gentlemen," said athos, addressing at the same
 
 ___________________________
 
 time his companions and
their adversaries, "are we ready?"

"yes!" answered the englishmen and the frenchmen, as with one voice.

"on guard, then!" cried athos.

immediately eight swords glittered in the rays of the setting sun, and
the combat began with an animosity very natural between men twice
enemies.

athos fenced with as much calmness and method as if he had been
practicing in a fencing school.

porthos, abated, no doubt, of his too-great confidence by his adventure
of chantilly, played with skill and prudence. aramis, who had the third
canto of his poem to finish, behaved like a man in haste.

athos killed his adversary first. he hit him but once, but as he had
foretold, that hit was a mortal one; the sword pierced his heart.

second, porthos stretched his upon the grass with a wound through his

an put the purse into his pocket.

"and now, my young friend, for you will permit me, i hope, to give you
that name," said lord de winter, "on this very evening, if agreeable to
you, i will present you to my sister, milady clarik, for i am desirous
that she should take you into her good graces; and as she is not in bad
odor at court, she may perhaps on some future day speak a word that will
not prove useless to you."

d’artagnan blushed with pleasure, and bowed a sign of assent.

at this time athos came up to d’artagnan.

"what do you mean to do with that purse?" whispered he.

"why, i meant to pass it over to you, my dear athos."

"me! why to me?"

"why, you killed him! they are the spoils of victory."

"i, the heir of an enemy!" said athos; "for whom, then, do you take me?"

"it is the custom in war," said d’artagnan, "why should it not be the
custom in a duel?"

"even on the field of battle, i have never done that."

porthos shrugged his shoulders; aramis by a movement of his lips

endorsed athos.

"then," said d’artagnan, "let us give the money to the lackeys, as lord
de winter desired us to do."

"yes," said athos; "let us give the money to the lackeys--not to our
lackeys, but to the lackeys of the englishmen."

athos took the purse, and threw it into the hand of the coachman. "for
you and your comrades."

this greatness of spirit in a man who was quite destitute struck even
porthos; and this french generosity, repeated by lord de winter and his
friend, was highly applauded, except by mm grimaud, bazin, mousqueton
and planchet.

lord de winter, on quitting d’artagnan, gave him his sister’s address.
she lived in the place royale--then the fashionable quarter--at number
6, and he undertook to call and take
 
 ___________________________
 
 d’artagnan with him in order to
introduce him. d’artagnan appointed eight o’clock at athos’s residence.

this introduction to milady clarik occupied the head of our gascon
greatly. he remembered in what a strange manner this woman had hitherto
been mixed up in his destiny. according to his conviction, she was some
creature of the cardinal, and yet he felt himself invincibly drawn
toward her by one of those sentiments for which we cannot account. his
only fear was that milady would recognize in him the man of meung and of
dover. then she knew that he was one of the friends of m. de 
 
 ___________________________
 
; which
would make him lose a part of his advantage, since when known to milady
as he knew her, he played only an equal game with her. as to the
commencement of an intrigue between her and m. de wardes, our
presumptuous hero gave but little heed to that, although the marquis was
young, handsome, rich, and high in the cardinal’s favor. it is not for
nothing we are but twenty years old, above all if we were born at
tarbes.

d’artagnan began by making his most splendid toilet, then returned to
athos’s, and according to custom, related everything to him. athos
listened to his projects, then shook his head, and recommended prudence
to him with a shade of bitterness.

"what!" said he, "you have just lost one woman, whom you call good,
charming, perfect; and here you are, running headlong after another."

d’artagnan felt the truth of this reproach.

"i loved madame bonacieux with my heart, while i only love milady with
my head," said he. "in getting introduced to her, my principal object i

s
to ascertain what part she plays at court."

"the part she plays, pardieu! it is not difficult to divine that, after
all you have told me. she is some emissary of the cardinal; a woman who
will draw you into a snare in which you will leave your head."

"the devil! my dear athos, you view things on the dark side, methinks."

"my dear fellow, i mistrust women. can it be otherwise? i bought my
experience dearly--particularly fair women. milady is fair, you say?"

"she has the most beautiful light hair imaginable!"

"ah, my poor d’artagnan!" said athos.

"listen to me! i want to be enlightened on a subject; then, when i shall
have learned what i desire to know, i will withdraw."

"be enlightened!" said athos, phlegmatically.

lord de winter arrived at the appointed time
 
 ___________________________
 
; but athos, being warned of
his coming, went into the other chamber. he therefore found d’artagnan
alone, and as it was nearly eight o’clock he took the young man with
him.

an elegant carriage waited below, and as it was drawn by two excellent
horses, they were soon at the place royale.

milady clarik received d’artagnan ceremoniously. her hotel was
remarkably sumptuous, and while the most part of the english had quit,
or were about to quit, france on account of the war, milady had just
been laying

 mule which should have the honor of carrying porthos and
mousqueton to glory.

these conditions being agreed to, porthos took leave of mme. coquenard.
the latter wished to detain him by darting certain tender glances; but
porthos urged the commands of duty, and the procurator’s wife was
obliged to give place to the king.

the musketeer returned home hungry and in bad humor.




33 soubrette and mistress


meantime, as we have said, despite the cries of his conscience and the
wise counsels of athos, d’artagnan became hourly more in love with
milady. thus he never failed to pay his diurnal court to her; and the
self-satisfied gascon was convinced that sooner or later she could not
fail to respond.

one day, when he arrived with his head in the air, and as light at heart
as a man who awaits a shower of gold, he found the soubrette under the
gateway of the hotel; but this time the pretty kitty was not contented
with touching him as he passed, she took him gently by the hand.

"good!" thoug

kitty’s consolation.




34 in which the equipment of aramis and porthos is treated of


since the four friends had been each in search of his equipments, there
had been no fixed meeting between them. they dined apart from one
another, wherever they might happen to be, or rather where they could.
duty likewise on its part took a portion of that precious time which was
gliding away so rapidly--only they had agreed to meet once a week, about
one o’clock, at the residence of athos, seeing that he, in agreement
with the vow he had formed, did not pass over the threshold of his door.

this day of reunion was the same day as that on which kitty came to find
d’artagnan. soon as kitty left him, d’artagnan directed his steps toward
the rue ferou.

he found athos and aramis philosophizing. aramis had some slight
inclination to resume the cassock. athos, according to his system,
neither encouraged nor dissuaded him. athos believed that everyone
should be left to his own free
 
 ___________________________
 
 will. he never gave advice but when it
was asked, and even then he required to be asked twice.

"people, in general," he said, "only ask advice not to follow it; or if
they do follow it, it is for the sake of having someone to blame for
having given it."

porthos arrived a minute after d’artagnan. the four friends were
reunited.

the four countenances expressed four different feelings: that of
porthos, tranquillity; that of d’artagnan, hope; that of aramis,
uneasiness; that of athos, carelessness.

at the end of a moment’s conversation, in which porthos hinted that a
lady of elevated rank had condescended to relieve him from his
embarrassment, mousqueton entered. he came to request his master to
return to his lodgings, where his presence was urgent, as he piteously
said.

"is it my equipment?"

"yes and no," replied mousqueton.

"well, but can’t you speak?"

"come, monsieur."

porthos rose, saluted his friends, and followed mousqueton. an instant
after, bazin made his 
 
 ___________________________
 
"a man! what man?"

"a mendicant."

"give him alms, bazin, and bid him pray for a poor sinner."

"this mendicant insists upon speaking to you, and pretends that you will
be very glad to see him."

"has he sent no particular message for me?"

"yes. if monsieur aramis hesitates to come," he said, "tell him i am
from tours."

"from tours!" cried aramis. "a thousand pardons, gentlemen; but no doubt
this man brings me the news i expected." and rising also, he went off at
a quick pace. there remained athos and d’artagnan.

"i believe these fellows have managed their business. what do you think,
d’artagnan?" said athos.

"i know that porthos was in a fair way," replied d’artagnan; "and as to
aramis to tell you the truth, i have never been seriously uneasy on his
account. but you, my dear athos--you, who so generously distributed the
englishman’s pistoles, which were our legitimate property--what do you
mean to do?"

"i am satisfied with having killed that fellow, my boy, seeing that it
is 
 
 ___________________________
 
blessed bread to kill an englishman; but if i had pocketed his
pistoles, they would have weighed me down like a remorse."

"go to, my dear athos; you have truly inconceivable ideas."

"let it pass. what do you think of monsieur de treville telling me, when
he did me the honor to call upon me yesterday, that you associated with
the suspected english, whom the cardinal protects?"

"that is to say, i visit an englishwoman--the one i named."

"oh, ay! the fair woman on whose account i gave you advice, which
naturally you took care not to adopt."

"i gave you my reasons."

"yes; you look there for your outfit, i think you said."

"not at all
 
 ___________________________
 
. i have acquired certain knowledge that that woman was
concerned in the abduction of madame bonacieux."

"yes, i understand now: to find one woman, you court another. it is the
longest road, but certainly the most amusing."

d’artagnan was on the point of telling athos all; but one consideration
restrained him. athos was a gentleman, punctilious in points of honor;
and there were in the plan which our lover had devised for milady, he
was sure, certain things that would not obtain the assent of this
puritan. he was therefore silent; and as athos was the least inquisitive
of any man on earth, d’artagnan’s confidence stopped there. we will
therefore leave the two friends, who had nothing important to say to
each other, and follow aramis.

upon being informed that the person who wanted to speak to him came 
 
 ___________________________
 
es, we shall yet have happy days! my love, my blood, my life! all, all,
all, are thine, my adored mistress!"

and he kissed the letter with passion, without even vouchsafing a look
at the gold which sparkled on the table.

bazin scratched at the door, and as aramis had no longer any reason to
exclude him, he bade him come in.

bazin was stupefied at the sight of the gold, and forgot that he came to
announce d’artagnan, who, curious to know who the mendicant could be,
came to aramis on leaving athos.

now, as d’artagnan used no ceremony with aramis, seeing that bazin
forgot to announce him, he announced himself.

"the devil! my dear aramis," said d’artagnan, "if these are the prunes
that are sent to you from tours, i beg you will make my compliments to
the gardener who gathers them."

"you are mistaken, friend d’artagnan," said aramis, always on his guard;
"this is from my publisher, who has just sent me the price of that poem
in one-syllable verse which i began yonder."

"ah, indeed
 
 ___________________________
 
ry, i confess, to
fortify myself with a few glasses of good old burgundy."

"agreed, as to the old burgundy; i have no objection to that," said
aramis, from whom the letter and the gold had removed, as by magic, his
ideas of conversion.

and having put three or four double pistoles into his pocket to answer
the needs of the moment, he placed the others in the ebony box, inlaid
with mother of pearl, in which was the famous handkerchief which served
him as a talisman.

the two friends repaired to athos’s, and he, faithful to his vow of not
going out, took upon him to order dinner to be brought to them. as he
was perfectly acquainted with the details of gastronomy, d’artagnan and
aramis made no objection to abandoning this important care to him.

they went to find porthos, and at the corner of the rue bac met
mousqueton, who, with a most pitiable air, was driving before him a mule
and a horse.

d’artagnan uttered a cry of surprise, which was not quite free from joy.

"ah, my yellow horse

it sounded one o’clock. it was necessary to separate.
d’artagnan at the moment of quitting milady felt only the liveliest
regret at the parting; and as they addressed each other in a
reciprocally passionate adieu, another interview was arranged for the
following week.

poor kitty hoped to speak a few words to d’artagnan when he passed
through her chamber; but milady herself reconducted him through the
darkness, and only quit him at the staircase.

the next morning d’artagnan ran to find athos. he was engaged in an
adventure so singular that he wished for counsel. he therefore told him
all.

"your milady," said he, "appears to be an infamous creature, but not the
less you have done wrong to deceive her. in one fashion or another you
have a terrible enemy on your hands."

while thus speaking athos regarded with attention the sapphire set with
diamonds which had taken, on d’artagnan’s finger, the place of the
queen’s ring, carefully kept in a casket.

"you notice my ring?" said t
 
 ___________________________
 
he gascon, proud to display so rich a gift
in the eyes of his friends.

"yes," said athos, "it reminds me of a family jewel."

"it is beautiful, is it not?" said d’artagnan.

"yes," said athos, "magnificent. i did not think two sapphires of such a
fine water existed. have you traded it for your diamond?"

"no. it is a gift from my beautiful englishwoman, or rather
frenchwoman--for i am convinced she was born in france, though i have
not questioned her."

"that ring comes from milady?" cried athos, with a voice in which it was
easy to detect strong emotion.

"her very self; she gave it to me last night. here it is," replied
d’artagnan, taking it from his finger.

athos examined it and became very pale. he tried it on his left hand; it
fit his finger as if made for it.

a shade of anger and vengeance passed across the usually calm brow of
this gentleman.

"it is impossible it can be she," said he. "how could this ring come
into the hands of milady clarik? and yet it is difficult to supp
 
 ___________________________
 
ose such
a resemblance should exist between two jewels."

"do you know this ring?" said d’artagnan.

"i thought i did," replied athos; "but no doubt i was mistaken." and he
returned d’artagnan the ring without, however, ceasing to look at it.

"pray, d’artagnan," said athos, after a minute, "either take off that
ring or turn the mounting inside; it recalls such cruel recollections
that i shall have no head to converse with you. don’t ask me for
counsel; don’t tell me you are perplexed what to do. but stop! let me
look at that sapphire again; the one i mentioned to you had one of its
faces scratched by accident."

d’artagnan took off the ring, giving it again to athos.

athos started. "look," said he, "is it not strange?" and he pointed out
to d’artagnan th
 
 ___________________________
 
e scratch he had remembered.

"but from whom did this ring come to you, athos?"

"from my mother, who inherited it from her mother. as i told you, it is
an old family jewel."

"and you--sold it?" asked d’artagnan, hesitatingly.

"no," replied athos, with a singular smile. "i gave it away in a night
of love, as it has been given to you."

d’artagnan became pensive in his turn; it appeared as if there were
abysses in milady’s soul whose depths were dark and unknown. he took
back the ring, but put it in his pocket and not on his finger.

"d’artagnan," said athos, taking his hand, "you know i love you; if i
had a son i could not love him better. take my advice, renounce this
woman. i do not know her, but a sort of intuition tells me she
 
 ___________________________
 
 is a lost
creature, and that there is something fatal about her."

"you are right," said d’artagnan; "i will have done with her. i own that
this woman terrifies me."

"shall you have the courage?" said athos.

"i shall," replied d’artagnan, "and instantly."

"in truth, my young friend, you will act rightly," said the gentleman,
pressing the gascon’s hand with an affection almost paternal; "and god
grant that this woman, who has scarcely entered into your life, may not
leave a terrible trace in it!" and athos bowed to d’artagnan like a man
who wishes it understood that he would not be sorry to be left alone
with his thoughts.

on reaching home d’artagnan found kitty waiting for him. a month

time. my brother-in-law and myself expected you yesterday and the day

"that’s all very simple," said d’artagnan; "i expected this letter. my
credit rises by the fall of that of the comte de wardes."

"and will you go?" asked kitty.

"listen to me, my dear girl," said the gascon, who sought for an excuse
in his own eyes for breaking the promise he had made athos; "you must
understand it would be impolitic not to accept such a positive
invitation. milady, not seeing me come again, would not be able to
understand what could cause the interruption of my visits, and might
suspect something; who could say how far the vengeance of such a woman
would go?"

"oh, my god!" said kitty, "you know how to represent things in such a
way that you are always in the right. you are going now to pay your
court to her again, and if this time you succeed in pleasing her in

obe, a large hood, and a cloak. she gave him some
slippers, in which he placed his naked feet, and then conducted him down
the stairs. it was time. milady had already rung her bell, and roused
the whole hotel. the porter was drawing the cord at the moment milady
cried from her window, "don’t open!"

the young man fled while she was still threatening him with an impotent
gesture. the moment she lost sight of him, milady tumbled fainting into
her chamber.




38 how, without incommding himself, athos procures his equipment


d’artagnan was so completely bewildered that without taking any heed of
what might become of kitty he ran at full speed across half paris, and
did not stop till he came to athos’s door. the confusion of his mind,
the terror which spurred him on, the cries of some of the patrol who
started in pursuit of him, and the hooting of the people who,
notwithstanding the early hour, were going to their work, only made him
precipitate his course.

he crossed the court, ran up 
 
 ___________________________
 
the two flights to athos’s apartment, and
knocked at the door enough to break it down.

grimaud came, rubbing his half-open eyes, to answer this noisy summons,
and d’artagnan sprang with such violence into the room as nearly to
overturn the astonished lackey.

in spite of his habitual silence, the poor lad this time found his
speech.

"holloa, there!" cried he; "what do you want, you strumpet? what’s your
business here, you hussy?"

d’artagnan threw off his hood, and disengaged his hands from the folds
of the c

loak. at sight of the mustaches and the naked sword, the poor
devil perceived he had to deal with a man. he then concluded it must be
an assassin.

"help! murder! help!" cried he.

"hold your tongue, you stupid fellow!" said the young man; "i am
d’artagnan; don’t you know me? where is your master?"

"you, monsieur d’artagnan!" cried grimaud, "impossible."

"grimaud," said athos, coming out of his apartment in a dressing gown,
"grimaud, i thought i heard you permitting yourself to speak?"

"ah, monsieur, it is--"

"silence!"

grimaud contented himself with pointing d’artagnan out to his master
with his finger.

athos recognized his comrade, and phlegmatic as he was, he burst into a
laugh which was quite excused by the strange masquerade before his
eyes--petticoats falling over his shoes, sleeves tucked up, and
mustaches stiff with agitation.

"don’t laugh, my frien
 
 ___________________________
 
d!" cried d’artagnan; "for heaven’s sake, don’t
laugh, for upon my soul, it’s no laughing matter!"

and he pronounced these words with such a solemn air and with such a
real appearance of terror, that athos eagerly seized his hand, crying,
"are you wounded, my friend? how pale you are!"

"no, but i have just met with a terrible adventure! are you alone,
athos?"

"parbleu! whom do you expect to find with me at this hour?"

"well, well!" and d’artagnan rushed into athos’s chamber.

"come, speak!" said the latter, closing the door and bolting it, that
they might not be disturbed. "is the king dead? have you killed the
cardinal? you are quite upset! come, come, tell me; i am dying with
curiosity and uneasiness!"

"athos," said d’artagnan, getting rid of his female garments, and
appearing in his shirt, "prepare yourself to hear an incredible, an
unheard-of story."

"well, but put on this dressing gown first," said the musketeer to his
friend.

d’artagnan do

nned the robe as quickly as he could, mistaking one sleeve
for the other, so greatly was he still agitated.

"well?" said athos.

"well," replied d’artagnan, bending his mouth to athos’s ear, and
lowering his voice, "milady is marked with a fleur-de-lis upon her
shoulder!"

"ah!" cried the musketeer, as if he had received a ball in his heart.

"let us see," said d’artagnan. "are you sure that the other is dead?"

"the other?" said athos, in so stifled a voice that d’artagnan scarcely
heard him.

"yes, she of whom you told me one day at amiens."

athos uttered a groan, and let his head sink on his hands.

"this is a woman of twenty-six or twenty-eight years."

"fair," said athos, "is she not?"

"very."

"blue and clear eyes, of a strange brilliancy, with black eyelids and
eyebrows?"

"yes."

"tall, well-made? she has lost a tooth, next to the eyetooth on the
left?"

"yes."

"the fleur-de-lis is small, rosy in color, and looks
 
 ___________________________
 
 as if efforts had
been made to efface it by the application of poultices?"

"yes."

"but you say she is english?"

"she is called milady, but she may be french. lord de winter is only her
brother-in-law."

"i will see her, d’artagnan!"

"beware, athos, beware. you tried to kill her; she is a woman to return
you the like, and not to fail."

"she will not dare to say anything; that would be to denounce herself."

"she is capable of anything or everything. did you ever see her
furious?"

"no," said athos.

"a tigress, a panther! ah, my dear athos, i am greatly afraid i have
drawn a terrible vengeance on both of us!"

d’artagnan then related all--the mad passion of milady and her menaces
of death.

"you are right; and upon my soul, i would giv

athos. "fortunately, the day after tomorrow we leave paris. we are going
according to all probability to la rochelle, and once gone--"

"she will follow you to the end of the world, athos, if she recognizes
you. let her, then, exhaust her vengeance on me alone!"

"my dear friend, of what consequence is it if she kills me?" said athos.
"do you, perchance, think i set any great store by life?"

"there is something horribly mysterious under all this, athos; this
woman is one of the cardinal’s spies, i am sure of that."

"in that case, take care! if the cardinal does not hold you in high
admiration for the affair of london, he entertains a great hatred for
you; but as, considering everything, he cannot accuse you openly, and as
hatred must be satisfied, particularly when it’s a cardinal’s hatred,
take care of yourself. if you go out, do not go out alone; when you eat,
use every precaution. mistrust everything, in short, even your own
shadow.

"

"fortunately," said d’artagnan, "all this will be only necessary till
after tomorrow evening, for when once with the army, we shall have, i
hope, only men to dread."

"in the meantime," said athos, "i renounce my plan of seclusion, and
wherever you go, i will go with you. you must return to the rue des
fossoyeurs; i will accompany you."

"but however near it may be," replied d’artagnan, "i cannot go thither
in this guise."

"that’s true," said athos, and he rang the bell.

grimaud entered.

athos made him a sign to go to d’artagnan’s residence, and bring back
some clothes. grimaud replied by another sign that he understood
perfectly, and set off.

"all this will not advance your outfit," said athos; "for if i am not
mistaken, you have left the best of your apparel with milady, and she
will certainly not have the politeness to return it to you. fortunately,
you have the sapphire."

"the jewel is yours, my dear athos! did you not tell me
 
 ___________________________
 
sed through the hands of that
infamous creature? never; that ring is defiled, d’artagnan."

"sell it, then."

"sell a jewel which came from my mother! i vow i should consider it a
profanation."

"pledge it, then; you can borrow at least a thousand crowns on it. with
that sum you can extricate yourself from your present difficulties; and
when you are full of money again, you can redeem it, and take it back
cleansed from its ancient stains, as it will have passed through the
hands of usurers."

athos smiled.

"you are a capital companion, d’artagnan," said be; "your never-failing
cheerfulness raises poor souls in affliction. well, let us pledge the
ring, but upon one condition."

"what?"

"that there shall be five hundred crowns for you, and five hundred
crowns for me."

"don’t dream it, athos. i don’t need the quarter of such a sum--i who am
still only in the guards--and by selling my saddles, i shall procure it.
what do i want? a horse for planchet, that’s all. besides, you forget
 
 ___________________________
 
e half the
sum that will be advanced upon it, or i will throw it into the seine;
and i doubt, as was the case with polycrates, whether any fish will be
sufficiently complaisant to bring it back to us."

"well, i will take it, then," said d’artagnan.

at this moment grimaud returned, accompanied by planchet; the latter,
anxious about his master and curious to know what had happened to him,
had taken advantage of the opportunity and brought the garments himself.

d'artagnan dressed himself, and athos did the same. when the two were
ready to go out, the latter made grimaud the sign of a man taking aim,
and the lackey immediately took down his musketoon, and prepared to
follow his master.

they arrived without accident at the rue des fossoyeurs. bonacieux was
standing at the door, and looked at d’artagnan hatefully.

"make haste, dear lodger," said he; "there is a very pretty girl waiting
for you upstairs; and you know women don’t like to be kept waiting."

"that’s kitty!" said d’arta

p me out of paris; help me
out of france!"

"i cannot take you, however, to the siege of la rochelle," aid
d’artagnan.

"no; but you can place me in one of the provinces with some lady of your
acquaintance--in your own country, for instance."

"my dear little love! in my country the ladies do without chambermaids.
but stop! i can manage your business for you. planchet, go and find
aramis. request him to come here directly. we have something very
important to say to him."

"i understand," said athos; "but why not porthos? i should have thought
that his duchess--"

"oh, porthos’s duchess is dressed by her husband’s clerks," said
d’artagnan, laughing. "besides, kitty would not like to live in the rue
aux ours. isn’t it so, kitty?"

"i do not care where i live," said kitty, "provided i am well concealed,
and nobody knows where i am."

"meanwhile, kitty, when we are about to separate, and you are no longer
jealous of me--"

"monsieur chevalier, far off or near," said kitty, "i shall al

ways love
you."

"where the devil will constancy niche itself next?" murmured athos.

"and i, also," said d’artagnan, "i also. i shall always love you; be
sure of that. but now answer me. i attach great importance to the
question i am about to put to you. did you never hear talk of a young
woman who was carried off one night?"

"there, now! oh, monsieur chevalier, do you love that woman still?"

"no, no; it is one of my friends who loves her--monsieur athos, this
gentleman here."

"i?" cried athos, with an accent like that of a man who perceives he is
about to tread upon an adder.

"you, to be sure!" said d’artagnan, pressing athos’s hand. "you know the
interest we both take in this poor little madame bonacieux. besides,
kitty will tell nothing; will you, kitty? you understand, my dear girl,"
continued d’artagnan, "she is the wife of that frightful baboon you saw
at the door as you came in."

"oh, my god! you remind me of my fright! if he should have known me
again!"

"how? know yo

u again? did you ever see that man before?"

"he came twice to milady’s."

"that’s it. about what time?"

"why, about fifteen or eighteen days ago."

"exactly so."

"and yesterday evening he came again."

"yesterday evening?"

"yes, just before you came."

"my dear athos, we are enveloped in a network of spies. and do you
believe he knew you again, kitty?"

"i pulled down my hood as soon as i saw him, but perhaps it was too
late."

"go down, athos--he mistrusts you less than me--and see if he be still
at his door."

athos went down and returned immediately.

"he has gone," said he, "and the house door is shut."

"he has gone to make his report, and to say that all the pigeons are at
this moment in the dovecot."

"well, then, let us all fly," said athos, "and leave nobody here but
planchet to bring us news."

"a minute. aramis, whom we have sent for!"

"that’s true," said athos; "we must wait for aramis."

at that moment aramis entered.
 
 ___________________________
 
quitting paris."

"then," said aramis, "this falls out very well."

he placed himself at the table and wrote a little note which he sealed
with a ring, and gave the billet to kitty.

"and now, my dear girl," said d’artagnan, "you know that it is not good
for any of us to be here. therefore let us separate. we shall meet again
in better days."

"and whenever we find each other, in whatever place it may be," said
kitty, "you will find me loving you as i love you today."

"dicers’ oaths!" said athos, while d’artagnan went to conduct kitty
downstairs.

an instant afterward the three young men separated, agreeing to meet
again at four o’clock with athos, and leaving planchet to guard the
house.

aramis returned home, and athos and d’artagnan busied themselves about
pledging the sapphire.

as the gascon had foreseen, they easily obtained three hundred pistoles
on the ring. still further, the jew told them that if they would sell it
to him, as it would make a magnificent pendant for earr
 
 ___________________________
 
ings, he would
give five hundred pistoles for it.

athos and d’artagnan, with the activity of two soldiers and the
knowledge of two connoisseurs, hardly required three hours to purchase
the entire equipment of the musketeer. besides, athos was very easy, and
a noble to his fingers’ ends. when a thing suited him he paid the price
demanded, without thinking to ask for any abatement. d’artagnan would
have remonstrated at this; but athos put his hand upon his shoulder,
with a smile, and d’artagnan understood that it was all very well for
such a little gascon gentleman as himself to drive a bargain, but not
for a man who had the bearing of a prince. the musketeer met with a
superb andalusian horse, black as jet, nostrils of fire, legs clean and
elegant, rising six years. he examined him, and found him sound and
without blemish. they asked a thousand livres for him.

he might perhaps have been bought for less; but while d’art
 
 ___________________________
 
agnan was
discussing the price with the dealer, athos was counting out the money
on the table.

grimaud had a stout, short picard cob, which cost three hundred livres.

but when the saddle and arms for grimaud were purchased, athos had not a
sou left of his hundred and fifty pistoles. d’artagnan offered his
friend a part of his share which he should return when convenient.

but athos only replied to this proposal by shrugging his shoulders.

"how much did the jew say he would give for the sapphire if he purchased
it?" said athos.

"five hundred pistoles."

"that is to say, two hundred more--a hundred pistoles for you and a
hundred pistoles for me. well, now, that would be a real fortune to us,
my friend; let us go back to the jew’s again."

"what! will you--"

"this ring would certainly only recall very bitter remembrances; then we
shall never be masters of three hundred 
 
 ___________________________
 
pistoles to redeem it, so that
we really should lose two hundred pistoles by the bargain. go and tell
him the ring is his, d’artagnan, and bring back the two hundred pistoles
with you."

"reflect, athos!"

"ready money is needful for the present time, and we must learn how to
make sacrifices. go, d’artagnan, go; grimaud will accompany you with his
musketoon."

a half hour afterward, d’artagnan returned with the two thousand livres,
and without having met with any accident.

it was thus athos found at home resources which he did not expect.




39 a vision


at four o’clock the four friends were all assembled with athos. their
anxiety about their outfits had all disappeared, and each countenance
only preserved the expression of its own secret disquiet--for behind all
present happiness is concealed a fear for the future.

suddenly planchet entered, bringing two letters for d’artagnan.

the one was a little billet, genteelly folded, with a pretty seal in
green wax on which was imp

nd opened it eagerly.

"be," said the letter, "on thursday next, at from six to seven o’clock
in the evening, on the road to chaillot, and look carefully into the
carriages that pass; but if you have any consideration for your own life
or that of those who love you, do not speak a single word, do not make a
movement which may lead anyone to believe you have recognized her who
exposes herself to everything for the sake of seeing you but for an
instant."

no signature.

"that’s a snare," said athos; "don’t go, d’artagnan."

"and yet," replied d’artagnan, "i think i recognize the writing."

"it may be counterfeit," said athos. "between six and seven o’clock the
road of chaillot is quite deserted; you might as well go and ride in the
forest of bondy."

"but suppose we all go," said d’artagnan; "what the devil! they won’t
devour us all four, four lackeys, horses, arms, and all!"

"and besides, it will be a chance for displaying our new equipments,"
said porthos.

"but if it is a

"we will remain in the background," said porthos, "and he will advance
alone."

"yes; but a pistol shot is easily fired from a carriage which goes at a
gallop."

"bah!" said d’artagnan, "they will miss me; if they fire we will ride
after the carriage, and exterminate those who may be in it. they must be
enemies."

"he is right," said porthos; "battle. besides, we must try our own
arms."

"bah, let us enjoy that pleasure," said aramis, with his mild and
careless manner.

"as you please," said athos.

"gentlemen," said d’artagnan, "it is half past four, and we have
scarcely time to be on the road of chaillot by six."

"besides, if we go out too late, nobody will see us," said porthos, "and
that will be a pity. let us get ready, gentlemen."

"but this second letter," said athos, "you forget that; it appears to
me, however, that the seal denotes that it deserves to be opened. for my
part, i declare, d’artagnan, i think it of much more consequence than
the little piece of waste paper you 
 
 ___________________________
 
have so cunningly slipped into your
bosom."

d’artagnan blushed.

"well," said he, "let us see, gentlemen, what are his eminence’s
commands," and d’artagnan unsealed the letter and read,

"m. d’artagnan, of the king’s guards, company dessessart, is expected at
the palais-cardinal this evening, at eight o’clock.

"la houdiniere, captain of the guards"

"the devil!" said athos; "here’s a rendezvous much more serious than the
other."

"i will go to the second after attending the first," said d’artagnan.
"one is for seven o’clock, and the other for eight; there will be time
for both."

"hum! i would not go at all," said aramis. "a gallant knight cannot
decline a rendezvous with a lady; but a prudent gentleman may excuse
himself from not waiting on his eminence, particularly when he has
reason to believe he is not invited to make his compliments."

"i am of aramis
 
 ___________________________
 
’s opinion," said porthos.

"gentlemen," replied d’artagnan, "i have already received by monsieur de
cavois a similar invitation from his eminence. i neglected it, and on
the morrow a serious misfortune happened to me--constance disappeared.
whatever may ensue, i will go."

"if you are determined," said athos, "do so."

"but the bastille?" said aramis.

"bah! you will get me out if they put me there," said d’artagnan.

"to be sure we will," replied aramis and porthos, with admirable
promptness and decision, as if that were the simplest thing in the
world, "to be sure we will get you out; but meantime, as we are to set
off the day after tomorrow, you would do much better not to risk this
bastille."

"let us do better than that," said athos; "do not let us leave him
during the whole evening. let eac
 
 ___________________________
 
h of us wait at a gate of the palace
with three musketeers behind him; if we see a close carriage, at all
suspicious in appearance, come out, let us fall upon it. it is a long
time since we have had a skirmish with the guards of monsieur the
cardinal; monsieur de treville must think us dead."

"to a certainty, athos," said aramis, "you were meant to be a general of
the army! what do you think of the plan, gentlemen?"

"admirable!" replied the young men in chorus.

"well," said porthos, "i will run to the hotel, and engage our comrades
to hold themselves in readiness by eight o’clock; the rendezvous, the
place du palais-cardinal. meantime, you see that the lackeys saddle the
horses."

"i have no horse," said d’artagnan; "but that is of no consequence, i
can take one of monsieur de treville’s."

"that 
 
 ___________________________
 
is not worth while," said aramis, "you can have one of mine."

"one of yours! how many have you, then?" asked d’artagnan.

"three," replied aramis, smiling.

"certes," cried athos, "you are the best-mounted poet of france or
navarre."

"well, my dear aramis, you don’t want three horses? i cannot comprehend
what induced you to buy three!"

"therefore i only purchased two," said aramis.

"the third, then, fell from the clouds, i suppose?"

"no, the third was brought to me this very morning by a groom out of
livery, who would not tell me in whose service he was, and who said he
had received orders from his master."

"or his mistress," interrupted d’artagnan.

"that make
 
 ___________________________
 
s no difference," said aramis, coloring; "and who affirmed, as
i said, that he had received orders from his master or mistress to place
the horse in my stable, without informing me whence it came."

"it is only to poets that such things happen," said athos, gravely.

"well, in that case, we can manage famously," said d’artagnan; "which of
the two horses will you ride--that which you bought or the one that was
given to you?"

"that which was given to me, assuredly. you cannot for a moment imagine,
d’artagnan, that i would commit such an offense toward--"

"the unknown giver," interrupted d’artagnan.

"or the mysterious benefactress," said athos.

"the one you bought will then become useless to you?"

"nearly so."

"and you selected it yourse

, so make haste."

a quarter of an hour afterward porthos appeared at the end of the rue
ferou on a very handsome genet. mousqueton followed him upon an auvergne
horse, small but very handsome. porthos was resplendent with joy and
pride.

at the same time, aramis made his appearance at the other end of the
street upon a superb english charger. bazin followed him upon a roan,
holding by the halter a vigorous mecklenburg horse; this was
d’artagnan’s mount.

the two musketeers met at the gate. athos and d’artagnan watched their
approach from the window.

"the devil!" cried aramis, "you have a magnificent horse there,
porthos."

"yes," replied porthos, "it is the one that ought to have been sent to
me at first. a bad joke of the husband’s substituted the other; but the
husband has been punished since, and i have obtained full satisfaction."

planchet and grimaud appeared in their turn, leading their masters’
steeds. d’artagnan and athos put themselves into saddle with their
companio

ns, and all four set forward; athos upon a horse he owed to a
woman, aramis on a horse he owed to his mistress, porthos on a horse he
owed to his procurator’s wife, and d’artagnan on a horse he owed to his
good fortune--the best mistress possible.

the lackeys followed.

as porthos had foreseen, the cavalcade produced a good effect; and if
mme. coquenard had met porthos and seen what a superb appearance he made
upon his handsome spanish genet, she would not have regretted the
bleeding she had inflicted upon the strongbox of h

x and if she was returning to paris, why
this fugitive rendezvous, why this simple exchange of a glance, why this
lost kiss? if, on the other side, it was not she--which was still quite
possible--for the little light that remained rendered a mistake
easy--might it not be the commencement of some plot against him through
the allurement of this woman, for whom his love was known?

his three companions joined him. all had plainly seen a woman’s head
appear at the window, but none of them, except athos, knew mme.
bonacieux. the opinion of athos was that it was indeed she; but less
preoccupied by that pretty face than d’artagnan, he had fancied he saw a
second head, a man’s head, inside the carriage.

"if that be the case," said d’artagnan, "they are doubtless transporting
her from one prison to another. but what can they intend to do with the
poor creature, and how shall i ever meet her again?"

"friend," said athos, gravely, "remember that it is the dead alone with
whom we are not like

the matter in hand.

d’artagnan was well known among the honorable corps of the king’s
musketeers, in which it was known he would one day take his place; he
was considered beforehand as a comrade. it resulted from these
antecedents that everyone entered heartily into the purpose for which
they met; besides, it would not be unlikely that they would have an
opportunity of playing either the cardinal or his people an ill turn,
and for such expeditions these worthy gentlemen were always ready.

athos divided them into three groups, assumed the command of one, gave
the second to aramis, and the third to porthos; and then each group went
and took their watch near an entrance.

d’artagnan, on his part, entered boldly at the principal gate.

although he felt himself ably supported, the young man was not without a
little uneasiness as he ascended the great staircase, step by step. his
conduct toward milady bore a strong resemblance to treachery, and he was
very suspicious of the political rela
 
 ___________________________
 
u today, i promise you to do so."

this last expression of richelieu’s conveyed a terrible doubt; it
alarmed d’artagnan more than a menace would have done, for it was a
warning. the cardinal, then, was seeking to preserve him from some
misfortune which threatened him. he opened his mouth to reply, but with
a haughty gesture the cardinal dismissed him.

d’artagnan went out, but at the door his heart almost failed him, and he
felt inclined to return. then the noble and severe countenance of athos
crossed his mind; if he made the compact with the cardinal which he
required, athos would no more give him his hand--athos would renounce
him.

it was this fear that restrained him, so powerful is the influence of a
truly great character on all that surrounds it.

d’artagnan descended by the staircase at which he had entered, and found
athos and the four musketeers waiting his appearance, and beginning to
grow uneasy. with a word, d’artagnan reassured them; and planchet ran to
inform the ot
 
 ___________________________
 
her sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer, as
his master had come out safe from the palais-cardinal.

returned home with athos, aramis and porthos inquired eagerly the cause
of the strange interview; but d’artagnan confined himself to telling
them that m. de richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter
into his guards with the rank of ensign, and that he had refused.

"and you were right," cried aramis and porthos, with one voice.

athos fell into a profound reverie and answered nothing. but when they
were alone he said, "you have done that which you ought to have done,
d’artagnan; but perhaps you have been wrong."

d’artagnan sighed deeply, for this voice responded to a secret voice of
his soul, which told him that great misfortunes awaited him.

the whole of the next day was spent in preparations for departure.
d’artagnan went to take leave of m. de treville. at that time it was
believed that the separation of the muske

follow him with her eyes, she
waved her handkerchief to him, leaning so far out of the window as to
lead people to believe she wished to precipitate herself. porthos
received all these attentions like a man accustomed to such
demonstrations, only on turning the corner of the street he lifted his
hat gracefully, and waved it to her as a sign of adieu.

on his part aramis wrote a long letter. to whom? nobody knew. kitty, who
was to set out that evening for tours, was waiting in the next chamber.

athos sipped the last bottle of his spanish wine.

in the meantime d’artagnan was defiling with his company. arriving at
the faubourg st. antoine, he turned round to look gaily at the bastille;
but as it was the bastille alone he looked at, he did not observe
milady, who, mounted upon a light chestnut horse, designated him with
her finger to two ill-looking men who came close up to the ranks to take
notice of him. to a look of interrogation which they made, milady
replied by a sign that it was he.

we have said, was to follow as soon as his bed of justice
had been held; but on rising from his bed of justice on the
twenty-eighth of june, he felt himself attacked by fever. he was,
notwithstanding, anxious to set out; but his illness becoming more
serious, he was forced to stop at villeroy.

now, whenever the king halted, the musketeers halted. it followed that
d’artagnan, who was as yet purely and simply in the guards, found
himself, for the time at least, separated from his good friends--athos,
porthos, and aramis. this separation, which was no more than an
unpleasant circumstance, would have certainly become a cause of serious
uneasiness if he had been able to guess by what unknown dangers he was
surrounded.

he, however, arrived without accident in the camp established before la
rochelle, on the tenth of the month of september of the year 1627.

everything was in the same state. the duke of buckingham and his
english, masters of the isle of re, continued to besiege, but without
suc

cquainted with the affairs of the court,
since she had discovered all. there could be no doubt she owed this
information to the cardinal.

but amid all this he perceived, with a feeling of real joy, that the
queen must have discovered the prison in which poor mme. bonacieux was
explaining her devotion, and that she had freed her from that prison;
and the letter he had received from the young woman, and her passage
along the road of chaillot like an apparition, were now explained.

then also, as athos had predicted, it became possible to find mme.
bonacieux, and a convent was not impregnable.

this idea completely restored clemency to his heart. he turned toward
the wounded man, who had watched with intense anxiety all the various
expressions of his countenance, and holding out his arm to him, said,
"come, i will not abandon you thus. lean upon me, and let us return to
the camp."

"yes," said the man, who could scarcely believe in such magnanimity,
"but is it not to have me hanged?"

sieged the citadel st. martin and the fort of la pree, as on their
side the french were besieging la rochelle.

d’artagnan, as we have said, had become more tranquil, as always happens
after a past danger, particularly when the danger seems to have
vanished. he only felt one uneasiness, and that was at not hearing any
tidings from his friends.

but one morning at the commencement of the month of november everything
was explained to him by this letter, dated from villeroy:

m d’artagnan,

mm athos, porthos, and aramis, after having had an entertainment at my
house and enjoying themselves very much, created such a disturbance that
the provost of the castle, a rigid man, has ordered them to be confined
for some days; but i accomplish the order they have given me by
forwarding to you a dozen bottles of my anjou wine, with which they are
much pleased. they are desirous that you should drink to their health in
their favorite wine. i have done this, and am, monsieur, with great
respect,

the ceremony of reception over, the four friends were soon in one
another’s arms.

"pardieu!" cried d’artagnan, "you could not have arrived in better time;
the dinner cannot have had time to get cold! can it, gentlemen?" added
the young man, turning to the two guards, whom he introduced to his
friends.

"ah, ah!" said porthos, "it appears we are feasting!"

"i hope," said aramis, "there are no women at your dinner."

"is there any drinkable wine in your tavern?" asked athos.

"well, pardieu! there is yours, my dear friend," replied d’artagnan.

"our wine!" said athos, astonished.

"yes, that you sent me."

"we sent you wine?"

"you know very well--the wine from the hills of anjou."

"yes, i know what brand you are talking about."

"the wine you prefer."

"well, in the absence of champagne and chambertin, you must content
yourselves with that."

"and so, connoisseurs in wine as we are, we have sent you some anjou
wine?" said porthos.

"not exactly, it is the wine

 that was sent by your order."

"on our account?" said the three musketeers.

"did you send this wine, aramis?" said athos.

"no; and you, porthos?"

"no; and you, athos?"

"no!"

"if it was not you, it was your purveyor," said d’artagnan.

"our purveyor!"

"yes, your purveyor, godeau--the purveyor of the musketeers."

"my faith! never mind where it comes from," said porthos, "let us taste
it, and if it is good, let us drink it."

"no," said athos; "don’t let us drink wine which comes from an unknown
source."

"you are right, athos," said d’artagnan. "did none of you charge your
purveyor, godeau, to send me some wine?"

"no! and yet you say he has sent you some as from us?"

"here is his letter," said d’artagnan, and he presented the note to his
comrades.

"this is not his writing!" said athos. "i am acquainted with it; before
we left villeroy i settled the accounts of the regiment."

"a false letter altogether," said porthos, "we

have not been
disciplined."

"d’artagnan," said aramis, in a reproachful tone, "how could you believe
that we had made a disturbance?"

d’artagnan grew pale, and a convulsive trembling shook all his limbs.

"thou alarmest me!" said athos, who never used thee and thou but upon
very particular occasions, "what has happened?"

"look you, my friends!" cried d’artagnan, "a horrible suspicion crosses
my mind! can this be another vengeance of that woman?"

it was now athos who turned pale.

d’artagnan rushed toward the refreshment room, the three musketeers and
the two guards following him.

the first object that met the eyes of d’artagnan on entering the room
was brisemont, stretched upon the ground and rolling in horrible
convulsions.

planchet and fourreau, as pale as death, were trying to give him succor;
but it was plain that all assistance was useless--all the features of
the dying man were distorted with agony.

"ah!" cried he, on perceiving d’artagn

s horrible!"

"do not think so, brisemont," said d’artagnan; "do not think so. i swear
to you, i protest--"

"oh, but god is above! god will punish you! my god, grant that he may
one day suffer what i suffer!"

"upon the gospel," said d’artagnan, throwing himself down by the dying
man, "i swear to you that the wine was poisoned and that i was going to
drink of it as you did."

"i do not believe you," cried the soldier, and he expired amid horrible
tortures.

"frightful! frightful!" murmured athos, while porthos broke the bottles
and aramis gave orders, a little too late, that a confessor should be
sent for.

"oh, my friends," said d’artagnan, "you come once more to save my life,
not only mine but that of these gentlemen. gentlemen," continued he,
addressing the guardsmen, "i request you will be silent with regard to
this adventure. great personages may have had a hand in what you have
seen, and if talked about, the evil would only recoil upon us."

"ah, monsieur!" stammered planchet, 
 
 ___________________________
 
 such a feast can only be very dull after what has taken
place; so accept my excuses, and put off the party till another day, i
beg of you."

the two guardsmen courteously accepted d’artagnan’s excuses, and
perceiving that the four friends desired to be alone, retired.

when the young guardsman and the three musketeers were without
witnesses, they looked at one another with an air which plainly
expressed that each of them perceived the gravity of their situation.

"in the first place," said athos, "let us leave this chamber; the dead
are not agreeable company, particularly when they have died a violent
death."

"planchet," said d’artagnan, "i commit the corpse of this poor devil to
your care. let him be interred in holy ground. he committed a crime, it
is true; but he repented of it."

and the four friends quit the room, leaving to planchet and fourreau the
duty of paying mortuary honors to brisemont.

the host gave them another chamber, and served them with fresh eggs and
some water,

 which athos went himself to draw at the fountain. in a few
words, porthos and aramis were posted as to the situation.

"well," said d’artagnan to athos, "you see, my dear friend, that this is
war to the death."

athos shook his head.

"yes, yes," replied he, "i perceive that plainly; but do you really
believe it is she?"

"i am sure of it."

"nevertheless, i confess i still doubt."

"but the fleur-de-lis on her shoulder?"

"she is some englishwoman who has committed a crime in france, and has
been branded in consequence."

"athos, she is your wife, i tell you," repeated d’artagnan; "only
reflect how much the two descriptions resemble each other."

"yes; but i should think the other must be dead, i hanged h

effectually."

it was d’artagnan who now shook his head in his turn.

"but in either case, what is to be done?" said the young man.

"the fact is, one cannot remain thus, with a sword hanging eternally
over his head," said athos. "we must extricate ourselves from this
position."

"but how?"

"listen! you must try to see her, and have an explanation with her. say
to her: ’peace or war! my word as a gentleman never to say anything of
you, never to do anything against you; on your side, a solemn oath to
remain neutral with respect to me. if not, i will apply to the
chancellor, i will apply to the king, i will apply to the hangman, i
will move the courts against you, i will denounce you as branded, i will

ial; and if you are acquitted, well, by the faith of a
gentleman, i will kill you at the corner of some wall, as i would a mad
dog.’"

"i like the means well enough," said d’artagnan, "but where and how to
meet with her?"

"time, dear friend, time brings round opportunity; opportunity is the
martingale of man. the more we have ventured the more we gain, when we
know how to wait."

"yes; but to wait surrounded by assassins and poisoners."

"bah!" said athos. "god has preserved us hitherto, god will preserve us
still."

"yes, we. besides, we are men; and everything considered, it is our lot
to risk our lives; but she," asked he, in an undertone.

"what she?" asked athos.

"constance."

"madame bonacieux! ah, that’s true!" said athos. "my poor friend, i had
forgotten you were in love."

"well, but," said aramis, "have you not learned by the letter you found
on the wretched corpse that she is in a convent? one may be very
comfortable in a convent;

and as soon as the siege of la rochelle is
terminated, i promise you on my part--"

"good," cried athos, "good! yes, my dear aramis, we all know that your
views have a religious tendency."

"i am only temporarily a musketeer," said aramis, humbly.

"it is some time since we heard from his mistress," said athos, in a low
voice. "but take no notice; we know all about that."

"well," said porthos, "it appears to me that the means are very simple."

"what?" asked d’artagnan.

"you say she is in a convent?" replied porthos.

"yes."

"very well. as soon as the siege is over, we’ll carry her off from that
convent."

"but we must first learn what convent she is in."

"that’s true," said porthos.

"but i think i have it," said athos. "don’t you say, dear d’artagnan,

on their part the musketeers, who had not much to do with the siege,
were not under very strict orders and led a joyous life. this was the
more easy for our three companions in particular; for being friends of
m. de treville, they obtained from him special permission to be absent
after the closing of the camp.

now, one evening when d’artagnan, who was in the trenches, was not able
to accompany them, athos, porthos, and aramis, mounted on their battle
steeds, enveloped in their war cloaks, with their hands upon their
pistol butts, were returning from a drinking place called the red
dovecot, which athos had discovered two days before upon the route to
jarrie, following the road which led to the camp and quite on their
guard, as we have stated, for fear of an ambuscade, when, about a
quarter of a league from the village of boisnau, they fancied they heard
the sound of horses approaching them. they

immediately all three halted,
closed in, and waited, occupying the middle of the road. in an instant,
and as the moon broke from behind a cloud, they saw at a turning of the
road two horsemen who, on perceiving them, stopped in their turn,
appearing to deliberate whether they should continue their route or go
back. the hesitation created some suspicion in the three friends, and
athos, advancing a few paces in front of the others, cried in a firm
voice, "who goes there?"

"who goes there, yourselves?" replied one of the horsemen.

"that is not an answer," replied athos. "who goes there? answer, or we
charge."

"beware of what you are about, gentlemen!" said a clear voice which
seemed accustomed to command.

"it is some superior officer making his night rounds," said athos. "what
do you wish, gentlemen?"

"who are you?" said the same voice, in the same commanding tone. "answe

in your turn, or you may repent of your disobedience."

"king’s musketeers," said athos, more and more convinced that he who
interrogated them had the right to do so.

"what company?"

"company of treville."

"advance, and give an account of what you are doing here at this hour."

the three companions advanced rather humbly--for all were now convinced
that they had to do with someone more powerful than themselves--leaving
athos the post of speaker.

one of the two riders, he who had spoken second, was ten paces in front
of his companion. athos made a sign to porthos and aramis also to remain
in the rear, and advanced alone.

"your pardon, my officer," said athos; "but we were ignorant with whom
we had to do, and you may see that we were keeping good guard."

"your name?" said the officer, who covered a part of his face with his
cloak.

"but yourself, monsieur," said athos, who began to be annoyed by this
inquisition, 
 
 ___________________________
 
"give me, i beg you, the proof that you have the right to
question me."

"your name?" repeated the cavalier a second time, letting his cloak
fall, and leaving his face uncovered.

"monsieur the cardinal!" cried the stupefied musketeer.

"your name?" cried his eminence, for the third time.

"athos," said the musketeer.

the cardinal made a sign to his attendant, who drew near. "these three
musketeers shall follow us," said he, in an undertone. "i am not willing
it should be known i have left the camp; and if they follow us we shall
be certain they will tell nobody."

"we are gentlemen, monseigneur," said athos; "require our parole, and
give yourself no uneasiness. thank god, we can keep a secret."

the cardinal fixed his piercing eyes on this courageous speaker.

"you have a quick ear, m

onsieur athos," said the cardinal; "but now
listen to this. it is not from mistrust that i request you to follow me,
but for my security. your companions are no doubt messieurs porthos and
aramis."

"yes, your eminence," said athos, while the two musketeers who had
remained behind advanced hat in hand.

"i know you, gentlemen," said the cardinal, "i know you. i know you are
not quite my friends, and i am sorry you are not so; but i know you are
brave and loyal gentlemen, and that confidence may be placed in you.
monsieur athos, do me, then, the honor to accompany me; you and your two
friends, and then i shall have an escort to excite envy in his majesty,
if we should meet him."

the three musketeers bowed to the necks of

their horses.

"well, upon my honor," said athos, "your eminence is right in taking us
with you; we have seen several ill-looking faces on the road, and we
have even had a quarrel at the red dovecot with four of those faces."

"a quarrel, and what for, gentlemen?" said the cardinal; "you know i
don’t like quarrelers."

"and that is the reason why i have the honor to inform your eminence of
what has happened; for you might learn it from others, and upon a false
account believe us to be in fault."

"what have been the results of your quarrel?

" said the cardinal,
knitting his brow.

"my friend, aramis, here, has received a slight sword wound in the arm,
but not enough to prevent him, as your eminence may see, from mounting
to the assault tomorrow, if your eminence orders an escalade."

"but you are not the men to allow sword wounds to be inflicted upon you
thus," said the cardinal. "come, be frank, gentlemen, you have settled
accounts with somebody! confess; you know i have the right of giving
absolution."

"i, monseigneur?" said athos. "i did not even draw my sword, but i took
him who offended me round the body, and threw him out of the window. it
appears that in falling," continued athos, with some hesitation, "he
broke his thigh."

"ah, ah!" said the cardinal; "and you, monsieur porthos?"

"i, monseigneur, knowing that dueling is prohibited--i seized a bench,
and gave one of those brigands such a blow that i believe his shoulder
is broken."

"very well," said the cardinal; "and you, monsieur aramis?"

"monseigneur, being o

patience failed me; i drew my sword in my turn, and as he came back to
the charge, i fancied i felt that in throwing himself upon me, he let it
pass through his body. i only know for a certainty that he fell; and it
seemed to me that he was borne away with his two companions."

"the devil, gentlemen!" said the cardinal, "three men placed hors de
combat in a cabaret squabble! you don’t do your work by halves. and pray
what was this quarrel about?"

"these fellows were drunk," said athos, "and knowing there was a lady
who had arrived at the cabaret this evening, they wanted to force her
door."

"force her door!" said the cardinal, "and for what purpose?"

"to do her violence, without doubt," said athos. "i have had the honor
of informing your eminence that these men were drunk."

"and was this lady young and handsome?" asked the cardinal, with a
certain degree of anxiety.

"we did not see her, monseigneur," said athos.

"you did not see her? ah, very well," replied the cardinal
 
 ___________________________
 
, quickly.
"you did well to defend the honor of a woman; and as i am going to the
red dovecot myself, i shall know if you have told me the truth."

"monseigneur," said athos, haughtily, "we are gentlemen, and to save our
heads we would not be guilty of a falsehood."

"therefore i do not doubt what you say, monsieur athos, i do not doubt
it for a single instant; but," added he, "to change the conversation,
was this lady alone?"

"the lady had a cavalier shut up with her," said athos, "but as
notwithstanding the noise, this cavalier did not show himself, it is to
be presumed that he is a coward."

"’judge not rashly’, says the gospel," replied the cardinal.

athos bowed.

"and now, gentlemen, that’s well," continued the cardinal. "i know what
i wish to know; follow me."

the three musketeers passed behind his eminence, who again enveloped his
face in his cloak, and put his horse in motion, keeping from eight to
ten paces in advance of his four companions.

they soon a

it was evident that without suspecting it, and actuated solely by their
chivalrous and adventurous character, our three friends had just
rendered a service to someone the cardinal honored with his special
protection.

now, who was that someone? that was the question the three musketeers
put to one another. then, seeing that none of their replies could throw
any light on the subject, porthos called the host and asked for dice.

porthos and aramis placed themselves at the table and began to play.
athos walked about in a contemplative mood.

while thinking and walking, athos passed and repassed before the pipe of
the stove, broken in halves, the other extremity passing into the
chamber above; and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur
of words, which at length fixed his attention. athos went close to it,
and distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an interest
that he made a sign to his friends to be silent, remaining himself bent
with his ear directed to the openi

ng of the lower orifice.

"listen, milady," said the cardinal, "the affair is important. sit down,
and let us talk it over."

"milady!" murmured athos.

"i listen to your eminence with greatest attention," replied a female
voice which made the musketeer start.

"a small vessel with an english crew, whose captain is on my side,
awaits you at the mouth of charente, at fort la pointe*. he will set
sail tomorrow morning."

_*fort la pointe, or fort vasou, was not built until 1672,
nearly 50 years later._

"i must go thither tonight?"

"instantly! that is to say, when you have received my instructions. two
men, whom you will find at the door on go
 
 ___________________________
 
 and as i desire to continue to merit the confidence of
your eminence, deign to unfold it to me in terms clear and precise, that
i may not commit an error."

there was an instant of profound silence between the two interlocutors.
it was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in
which he was about to speak, and that milady was collecting all her
intellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say, and
to engrave them in her memory when they should be spoken.

athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten
the door inside, and to make them a sign to come and listen with him.

the two musketeers, who loved their ease, brought a chair for each of
themselves and one for athos. all three then sat down with their heads
together and their ears on the alert.

"you will go to london," continued the cardinal. "arrived in london, you
will seek buckingham."

"i must beg your eminence to observe," said milady, "that since the

e you, and see nothing
out of the way in giving you what you demand with respect to so infamous
a creature--the more so as you tell me this d’artagnan is a libertine, a
duelist, and a traitor."

"an infamous scoundrel, monseigneur, a scoundrel!"

"give me paper, a quill, and some ink, then," said the cardinal.

"here they are, monseigneur."

there was a moment of silence, which proved that the cardinal was
employed in seeking the terms in which he should write the note, or else
in writing it. athos, who had not lost a word of the conversation, took
his two companions by the hand, and led them to the other end of the
room.

"well," said porthos, "what do you want, and why do you not let us
listen to the end of the conversation?"

"hush!" said athos, speaking in a low voice. "we have heard all it was
necessary we should hear; besides, i don’t prevent you from listening,
but i must be gone."

"you must be gone!" said porthos; "and if the cardinal asks for you,
what answer can we make?"

"y
 
 ___________________________
 
ou will not wait till he asks; you will speak first, and tell him that
i am gone on the lookout, because certain expressions of our host have
given me reason to think the road is not safe. i will say two words
about it to the cardinal’s esquire likewise. the rest concerns myself;
don’t be uneasy about that."

"be prudent, athos," said aramis.

"be easy on that head," replied athos; "you know i am cool enough."

porthos and aramis resumed their places by the stovepipe.

as to athos, he went out without any mystery, took his horse, which was
tied with those of his friends to the fastenings of the shutters, in
four words convinced the attendant of the necessity of a vanguard for
their return, carefully examined the priming of his pistols, drew his
sword, and took, like a forlorn hope, the road to the camp.




45 a conjugal scene


as athos had foreseen, it was not long before the cardinal came down. he
opened the door of the room in which the musketeers were, and found
por
 
 ___________________________
 
thos playing an earnest game of dice with aramis. he cast a rapid
glance around the room, and perceived that one of his men was missing.

"what has become of monseigneur athos?" asked he.

"monseigneur," replied porthos, "he has gone as a scout, on account of
some words of our host, which made him believe the road was not safe."

"and you, what have you done, monsieur porthos?"

"i have won five pistoles of aramis."

"well; now will you return with me?"

"we are at your eminence’s orders."

"to horse, then, gentlemen; for it is getting late."

the attendant was at the door, holding the cardinal’s horse by the
bridle. at a short distance a group of two men and thr
 
 ___________________________
 
ee horses appeared
in the shade. these were the two men who were to conduct milady to fort
la pointe, and superintend her embarkation.

the attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two musketeers had
already said with respect to athos. the cardinal made an approving
gesture, and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used
incoming.

let us leave him to follow the road to the camp protected by his esquire
and the two musketeers, and return to athos.

for a hundred paces he maintained the speed at which he started; but
when out of sight he turned his horse to the right, made a circuit, and
came back within twenty paces of a high hedge to watch the passage of
the little troop. having recognized the laced hats of his companions and
the golden fringe of the cardinal’s cloak, he waited till the horsemen
had turned the angle of the road, and having lost sight of them, he
returned at a gallop to the inn, which was opened to him without
hesitat

ion.

the host recognized him.

"my officer," said athos, "has forgotten to give a piece of very
important information to the lady, and has sent me back to repair his
forgetfulness."

"go up," said the host; "she is still in her chamber."

athos availed himself of the permission, ascended the stairs with his
lightest step, gained the landing, and through the open door perceived
milady putting on her hat.

he entered the chamber and closed the door behind him. at the noise he
made in pushing the bolt, milady turned round.

athos was standing before the door, enveloped in his cloak, with his hat
pulled down over his eyes. on seeing this figure, mute and immovable as
a statue, milady was frightened.

"who are you, and what do you want?" c

ried she.

"humph," murmured athos, "it is certainly she!"

and letting fall his cloak and raising his hat, he advanced toward
milady.

"do you know me, madame?" said he.

milady made one step forward, and then drew back as if she had seen a
serpent.

"so far, well," said athos, "i perceive you know me."

"the comte de la fere!" murmured milady, becoming exceedingly pale, and
drawing back till the wall prevented her from going any farther.

"yes, milady," replied athos; "the comte de la fere in person, who comes
expressly from the other world to have the pleasure of paying you a
visit. sit down, madame, and let us talk, as the cardinal said."

milady, under the influence of inexpressible terror, sat down without
uttering a word.

"you certainly are a demon sent upon the earth!" said athos. "your power
is great, i know; but you also know that with the help of god men have
often conquered the most terrible demons. you have once before thrown
yourself in my path
 
 ___________________________
 
. i thought i had crushed you, madame; but either i
was deceived or hell has resuscitated you!"

milady at these words, which recalled frightful remembrances, hung down
her head with a suppressed groan.

"yes, hell has resuscitated you," continued athos. "hell has made you
rich, hell has given you another name, hell has almost made you another
face; but it has neither effaced the stains from your soul nor the brand
from your body."

milady arose as if moved by a powerful spring, and her eyes flashed
lightning. athos remained sitting.

"you believed me to be dead, did you not, as i believed you to be? and
the name of athos as well concealed the comte de la fere, as the name
milady clarik concealed anne de breuil. was it not so you were called

hen your honored brother married us? our position is truly a strange
one," continued athos, laughing. "we have only lived up to the present
time because we believed each other dead, and because a remembrance is
less oppressive than a living creature, though a remembrance is
sometimes devouring."

"but," said milady, in a hollow, faint voice, "what brings you back to
me, and what do you want with me?"

"i wish to tell you that though remaining invisible to your eyes, i have
not lost sight of you."

"you know what i have done?"

"i can relate to you, day by day, your actions from your

believe that the wine came from his friends. in short, it was you who
have but now in this chamber, seated in this chair i now fill, made an
engagement with cardinal richelieu to cause the duke of buckingham to be
assassinated, in exchange for the promise he has made you to allow you
to assassinate d’artagnan."

milady was livid.

"you must be satan!" cried she.

"perhaps," said athos; "but at all events listen well to this.
assassinate the duke of buckingham, or cause him to be assassinated--i
care very little about that! i don’t know him. besides, he is an
englishman. but do not touch with the tip of your finger a single hair
of d’artagnan, who is a faithful friend whom i love and defend, or i
swear to you by the head of my father the crime which you shall have
endeavored to commit, or shall have committed, shall be the last."

"monsieur d’artagnan has cruelly insult

ed me," said milady, in a hollow
tone; "monsieur d’artagnan shall die!"

"indeed! is it possible to insult you, madame?" said athos, laughing;
"he has insulted you, and he shall die!"

"he shall die!" replied milady; "she first, and he afterward."

athos was seized with a kind of vertigo. the sight of this creature, who
had nothing of the woman about her, recalled awful remembrances. he
thought how one day, in a less dangerous situation than the one in which
he was now placed, he had already endeavored to sacrifice her to his
honor. his desire for blood returned, burning his brain and pervading
his frame like a raging fever; he arose in his turn, reached his hand to
his belt, drew forth a pistol, and cocked it.

milady, pale as a corpse, endeav
 
 ___________________________
 
ored to cry out; but her swollen tongue
could utter no more than a hoarse sound which had nothing human in it
and resembled the rattle of a wild beast. motionless against the dark
tapestry, with her hair in disorder, she appeared like a horrid image of
terror.

athos slowly raised his pistol, stretched out his arm so that the weapon
almost touched milady’s forehead, and then, in a voice the more terrible
from having the supreme calmness of a fixed resolution, "madame," said
he, "you will this instant deliver to me the paper the cardinal signed;
or upon my soul, i will blow your brains out."

with another man, milady might have preserved some doubt; but she knew
athos. nevertheless, she remained motionless.

"you have one second to decide," said he.

y saw by the contraction of his countenance that the trigger was
about to be pulled; she reached her hand quickly to her bosom, drew out
a paper, and held it toward athos.

"take it," said she, "and be accursed!"

athos took the paper, returned the pistol to his belt, approached the
lamp to be assured that it was the paper, unfolded it, and read:

"dec. 3, 1627

"it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this
has done what he has done.

"richelieu"

"and now," said athos, resuming his cloak and putting on his hat, "now
that i have drawn your teeth, viper, bite if you can."

and he left the chamber without once looking behind him.

at the door he found the two men and the spare horse which they held.

"gentlemen," said he, "monseigneur’s order is, you know, to conduct that
woman, without losing time, to fort la pointe, and never to leave her
till she is on board."

as these words agreed wholly with the order they had received, they
bowed their heads in sign of

 assent.

with regard to athos, he leaped lightly into the saddle and set out at
full gallop; only instead of following the road, he went across the
fields, urging his horse to the utmost and stopping occasionally to
listen.

in one of those halts he heard the steps of several horses on the road.
he had no doubt it was the cardinal and his escort. he immediately made
a new point in advance, rubbed his horse down with some heath and leaves
of trees, and placed himself across the road, about two hundred paces
from the camp.

"

who goes there?" cried he, as soon as he perceived the horsemen.

"that is our brave musketeer, i think," said the cardinal.

"yes, monseigneur," said porthos, "it is he."

"monsieur athos," said richelieu, "receive my thanks for the good guard
you have kept. gentlemen, we are arrived; take the gate on the left. the
watchword is, ’king and re.’"

saying these words, the cardinal saluted the three friends with an
inclination of his head, and took the right hand, followed by his
attendant--for that night he himself slept in the camp.

"well!" said porthos and aramis together, as soon as the cardinal was
out of hearing, "well, he signed the paper she required!"

"i know it," sai

d athos, coolly, "since here it is."

and the three friends did not exchange another word till they reached
their quarters, except to give the watchword to the sentinels. only they
sent mousqueton to tell planchet that his master was requested, the
instant that he left the trenches, to come to the quarters of the
musketeers.

milady, as athos had foreseen, on finding the two men that awaited her,
made no difficulty in following them. she had had for an instant an
inclination to be reconducted to the cardinal, and relate everything to
him; but a revelation on her part would bring about a revelation on the
part of athos. she might say that athos had hanged her; but then athos
would tell that she was branded. she thought it was best to preserve
silence, to discreetly set off to accomplish her difficult mission with
her usual skill; and

the cardinal, to come to him and claim her vengeance.

in consequence, after having traveled all night, at seven o’clock she
was at the fort of the point; at eight o’clock she had embarked; and at
nine, the vessel, which with letters of marque from the cardinal was
supposed to be sailing for bayonne, raised anchor, and steered its
course toward england.




46 the bastion saint-gervais


on arriving at the lodgings of his three friends, d’artagnan found them
assembled in the same chamber. athos was meditating; porthos was
twisting his mustache; aramis was saying his prayers in a charming
little book of hours, bound in blue velvet.

"pardieu, gentlemen," said he. "i hope what you have to tell me is worth
the trouble, or else, i warn you, i will not pardon you for making me
come here instead of getting a little rest after a night spent in taking
and dismantling a bastion. ah, why were you not there, gentlemen? it was
warm work."

"we were in a place where it was not very cold," replied

porthos, giving
his mustache a twist which was peculiar to him.

"hush!" said athos.

"oh, oh!" said d’artagnan, comprehending the slight frown of the
musketeer. "it appears there is something fresh aboard."

"aramis," said athos, "you went to breakfast the day before yesterday at
the inn of the parpaillot, i believe?"

"yes."

"how did you fare?"

"for my part, i ate but little. the day before yesterday was a fish day,
and they had nothing but meat."

"what," said athos, "no fish at a seaport?"

"they say," said aramis, resuming his pious reading, "that the dyke
which the cardinal is making drives them all out into the open sea."

"but that is not quite what i mean to ask you, aramis," replied athos.
"i want to know if you were left alone, and nobody interrupted you."

"why, i think there were not many intruders. yes, athos, i know what you
mean: we shall do very well at the parpaillot."

"let us go to the parpaillot, then, for here the walls are like sheets
o
 
 ___________________________
 
f paper."

d’artagnan, who was accustomed to his friend’s manner of acting, and who
perceived immediately, by a word, a gesture, or a sign from him, that
the circumstances were serious, took athos’s arm, and went out without
saying anything. porthos followed, chatting with aramis.

on their way they met grimaud. athos made him a sign to come with them.
grimaud, according to custom, obeyed in silence; the poor lad had nearly
come to the pass of forgetting how to speak.

they arrived at the drinking room of the parpaillot. it was seven
o’clock in the morning, and daylight began to appear. the three friends
ordered breakfast, and went into a room in which the host said they
would not be disturbed.

unfortunately, the hour was badly chosen for a private conference. the
morning drum had just been beaten; everyo

ne shook off the drowsiness of
night, and to dispel the humid morning air, came to take a drop at the
inn. dragoons, swiss, guardsmen, musketeers, light-horsemen, succeeded
one another with a rapidity which might answer the purpose of the host
very well, but agreed badly with the views of the four friends. thus
they applied very curtly to the salutations, healths, and jokes of their
companions.

"i see how it will be," said athos: "we shall get into some pretty
quarrel or other, and we have no need of one just now. d’artagnan, tell
us what sort of a night you have had, and we will describe ours
afterward."

"ah, yes," said a light-horseman, with a glass of brandy in his hand,
which he sipped slowly. "i hear you gentlemen of the guards have been in
the trenches tonight, and that you did not get much the best of the
rochellais."

d’artagnan looked at athos to know if he ought to reply to this intruder
who thus mixed u

nasked in their conversation.

"well," said athos, "don’t you hear monsieur de busigny, who does you
the honor to ask you a question? relate what has passed during the
night, since these gentlemen desire to know it."

"have you not taken a bastion?" said a swiss, who was drinking rum out
of a beer glass.

"yes, monsieur," said d’artagnan, bowing, "we have had that honor. we
even have, as you may have heard, introduced a barrel of powder under
one of the angles, which in blowing up made a very pretty breach.
without reckoning that as the ba

, "from behind which the
rochellais annoyed our workmen."

"was that affair hot?"

"yes, moderately so. we lost five men, and the rochellais eight or ten."

"balzempleu!" said the swiss, who, notwithstanding the admirable
collection of oaths possessed by the german language, had acquired a
habit of swearing in french.

"but it is probable," said the light-horseman, "that they will send
pioneers this morning to repair the bastion."

"yes, that’s probable," said d’artagnan.

"gentlemen," said athos, "a wager!"

"ah, wooi, a vager!" cried the swiss.

"what is it?" said the light-horseman.

"stop a bit," said the dragoon, placing his saber like a spit upon the
two large iron dogs which held the firebrands in the chimney, "stop a
bit, i am in it. you cursed host! a dripping pan immediately, that i may
not lose a drop of the fat of this estimable bird."

"you was right," said the swiss; "goose grease is kood with basdry."

"there!" said the dragoon. "now for the wager! we listen, monsieur
ath
 
 ___________________________
 
os."

"yes, the wager!" said the light-horseman.

"well, monsieur de busigny, i will bet you," said athos, "that my three
companions, messieurs porthos, aramis, and d’artagnan, and myself, will
go and breakfast in the bastion st. gervais, and we will remain there an
hour, by the watch, whatever the enemy may do to dislodge us."

porthos and aramis looked at each other; they began to comprehend.

"but," said d’artagnan, in the ear of athos, "you are going to get us
all killed without mercy."

"we are much more likely to be killed," said athos, "if we do not go."

"my faith, gentlemen," said porthos, turning round upon his chair and
twisting his mustache, "that’s a fair bet, i hope."

"i take it," said m. de busigny; "so let us fix the stake."

"you are four gentlemen," said athos, "and we are four; an unlimited
dinner for eight. will that do?"

"capitally," replied m. de busigny.

"perfectly," said the dragoon.

"that shoots me

," said the swiss.

the fourth auditor, who during all this conversation had played a mute
part, made a sign of the head in proof that he acquiesced in the
proposition.

"the breakfast for these gentlemen is ready," said the host.

"well, bring it," said athos.

the host obeyed. athos called grimaud, pointed to a large basket which
lay in a corner, and made a sign to him to wrap the viands up in the
napkins.

grimaud understood that it was to be a breakfast on the grass, took the
basket, packed up the viands, added the bottles, and then took the
basket on his arm.

"but where are you going to eat my breakfast?" asked the host.

"what matter, if you are paid for it?" said athos, and he threw two
pistoles majestically on the table.

"shall i give you the change, my officer?" s
 
 ___________________________
 
aid the host.

"no, only add two bottles of champagne, and the difference will be for
the napkins."

the host had not quite so good a bargain as he at first hoped for, but
he made amends by slipping in two bottles of anjou wine instead of two
bottles of champagne.

"monsieur de busigny," said athos, "will you be so kind as to set your
watch with mine, or permit me to regulate mine by yours?"

"which you please, monsieur!" said the light-horseman, drawing from his
fob a very handsome watch, studded with diamonds; "half past seven."

"thirty-five minutes after seven," said athos, "by which you perceive i
am five minutes faster than you."

and bowing to all the astonished persons present, the young men took the
road to the bastion st. gervais, followed by grimaud, who carried the
basket, ign

orant of where he was going but in the passive obedience
which athos had taught him not even thinking of asking.

as long as they were within the circle of the camp, the four friends did
not exchange one word; besides, they were followed by the curious, who,
hearing of the wager, were anxious to know how they would come out of
it. but when once they passed the line of circumvallation and found
themselves in the open plain, d’artagnan, who was completely ignorant of
what was going forward, thought it was time to demand an explanation.

"and now, my dear athos,"
 
 ___________________________
 
the kindness to tell me where
we are going?"

"why, you see plainly enough we are going to the bastion."

"but what are we going to do there?"

"you know well that we go to breakfast there."

"but why did we not breakfast at the parpaillot?"

"because we have very important matters to communicate to one another,
and it was impossible to talk five minutes in that inn without being
annoyed by all those importunate fellows, who keep coming in, saluting
you, and addressing you. here at least," said athos, pointing to the
bastion, "they will not come and disturb us."

"it appears to me," said d’artagnan, with that prudence which allied
itself in him so naturally with excessive bravery, "that we could have
found some retired place on the downs or the seashore."

"where we should have been seen all four conferring together, so that at
the end of a quarter of an hour the cardinal would have been informed by
his spies that we were holding a council."

"yes," said aramis, "athos is right: animadver

are going, in order to win it, to remain an hour in the
bastion. either we shall be attacked, or not. if we are not, we shall
have all the time to talk, and nobody will hear us--for i guarantee the
walls of the bastion have no ears; if we are, we will talk of our
affairs just the same. moreover, in defending ourselves, we shall cover
ourselves with glory. you see that everything is to our advantage."

"yes," said d’artagnan; "but we shall indubitably attract a ball."

"well, my dear," replied athos, "you know well that the balls most to be
dreaded are not from the enemy."

"but for such an expedition we surely ought to have brought our
muskets."

"you are stupid, friend porthos. why should we load ourselves with a
useless burden?"

"i don’t find a good musket, twelve cartridges, and a powder flask very
useless in the face of an enemy."

"well," replied athos, "have you not heard what d’artagnan said?"

"what did he say?" demanded porthos.

"d’artagnan said that in the attack of last
 
 ___________________________
 
 night eight or ten frenchmen
were killed, and as many rochellais."

"what then?"

"the bodies were not plundered, were they? it appears the conquerors had
something else to do."

"well?"

"well, we shall find their muskets, their cartridges, and their flasks;
and instead of four musketoons and twelve balls, we shall have fifteen
guns and a hundred charges to fire."

"oh, athos!" said aramis, "truly you are a great man."

porthos nodded in sign of agreement. d’artagnan alone did not seem
convinced.

grimaud no doubt shared the misgivings of the young man, for seeing that
they continued to advance toward the bastion--something he had till then
doubted--he pulled his master by the skirt of his coat.

"where are we going?" asked he, by a gesture.

athos pointed to the bastion.

"but," said grimaud, in the same silent dialect, "we shall leave our
skins there."

athos ra

ised his eyes and his finger toward heaven.

grimaud put his basket on the ground and sat down with a shake of the
head.

athos took a pistol from his belt, looked to see if it was properly
primed, cocked it, and placed the muzzle close to grimaud’s ear.

grimaud was on his legs again as if by a spring. athos then made him a
sign to take up his basket and to walk on first. grimaud obeyed. all
that grimaud gained by this momentary pantomime was to pass from the
rear guard to the vanguard.

arrived at the bastion, the four friends turned round.

more than three hundred soldiers of all kinds were assembled at the gate
of the camp; and in a separate group might be distinguished m. de
busigny, the dragoon, the swiss, and the fourth bettor.

athos took off his hat, placed it on the end of his sword, and w

in the air.

all the spectators returned him his salute, accompanying this courtesy
with a loud hurrah which was audible to the four; after which all four
disappeared in the bastion, whither grimaud had preceded them.




47 the council of the musketeers


as athos had foreseen, the bastion was only occupied by a dozen corpses,
french and rochellais.

"gentlemen," said athos, who had assumed the command of the expedition,
"while grimaud spreads the table, let us begin by collecting the guns
and cartridges together. we can talk while performing that necessary
task. these gentlemen," added he, pointing to the bodies, "cannot hear
us."

"but we could throw them into the ditch," said porthos, "after having
assured ourselves they have nothing in their pockets."

"yes," said athos, "that’s grimaud’s business."

"well, then," cried d’artagnan, "pray let grimaud sear
 
 ___________________________
 
ch them and throw
them over the walls."

"heaven forfend!" said athos; "they may serve us."

"these bodies serve us?" said porthos. "you are mad, dear friend."

"judge not rashly, say the gospel and the cardinal," replied athos. "how
many guns, gentlemen?"

"twelve," replied aramis.

"how many shots?"

"a hundred."

"that’s quite as many as we shall want. let us load the guns."

the four musketeers went to work; and as they were loading the last
musket grimaud announced that the breakfast was ready.

athos replied, always by gestures, that that was well, and indicated to
grimaud, by pointing to a turret that resembled a pepper caster, that he
was to stand as sentinel. only, to alleviate the tediousness of the
duty,

athos allowed him to take a loaf, two cutlets, and a bottle of
wine.

"and now to table," said athos.

the four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs crossed
like turks, or even tailors.

"and now," said d’artagnan, "as there is no longer any fear of being
overheard, i hope you are going to let me into your secret."

"i hope at the same time to procure you amusement and glory, gentlemen,"
said athos. "i have induced you to take a charming promenade; here is a
delicious breakfast; and yonder are five hundred persons, as you may see
through the loopholes, taking us for heroes or madmen--two classes of
imbeciles greatly resembling each other."

"but the secret!" said d’artagnan.

"the secret is," said athos, "that i saw milady last night."

d’artagnan was lifting a glass to his lips; but at the name of milady,
his hand trembled so, that he was obliged to put the glass on the ground
again 
 
 ___________________________
 
for fear of spilling the contents."

"you saw your wi--"

"hush!" interrupted athos. "you forget, my dear, you forget that these
gentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like yourself. i have
seen milady."

"where?" demanded d’artagnan.

"within two leagues of this place, at the inn of the red dovecot."

"in that case i am lost," said d’artagnan.

"not so bad yet," replied athos; "for by this time she must have quit
the shores of france."

d’artagnan breathed again.

"but after all," asked porthos, "who is milady?"

"a charming woman!" said athos, sipping a glass of sparkling wine.
"villainous host!" cried he, "he has given us anjou wine instead of
champagne, and fancies we know no better! yes," continued he, "a
charming woman, who entertained kind views toward our friend d’artagnan,
who, on his part, has given her some offense for which she tried to
revenge hersel

 shots, a
week ago by trying to poison him, and yesterday by demanding his head of
the cardinal."

"what! by demanding my head of the cardinal?" cried d’artagnan, pale
with terror.

"yes, that is true as the gospel," said porthos; "i heard her with my
own ears."

"i also," said aramis.

"then," said d’artagnan, letting his arm fall with discouragement, "it
is useless to struggle longer. i may as well blow my brains out, and all
will be over."

"that’s the last folly to be committed," said athos, "seeing it is the
only one for which there is no remedy."

"but i can never escape," said d’artagnan, "with such enemies. first, my
stranger of meung; then de wardes, to whom i have given three sword
wounds; next milady, whose secret i have discovered; finally, the
cardinal, whose vengeance i have balked."

"well," said athos, "that only makes four; and we are four--one for one.
pardieu! if we may believe the signs grimaud is making, we are about to
have to do with a very different number of

to speak, my
friend; but be laconic, i beg. what do you see?"

"a troop."

"of how many persons?"

"twenty men."

"what sort of men?"

"sixteen pioneers, four soldiers."

"how far distant?"

"five hundred paces."

"good! we have just time to finish this fowl and to drink one glass of
wine to your health, d’artagnan."

"to your health!" repeated porthos and aramis.

"well, then, to my health! although i am very much afraid that your good
wishes will not be of great service to me."

"bah!" said athos, "god is great, as say the followers of mohammed, and
the future is in his hands."

then, swallowing the contents of his glass, which he put down close to
him, athos arose carelessly, took the musket next to him, and drew near
to one of the loopholes.

porthos, aramis and d’artagnan followed his example. as to grimaud, he
received orders to place himself behind the four friends in order to
reload their weapons.

"pardieu!" said athos, "it was hardly worth while to distribute
ourselves for twe

nty fellows armed with pickaxes, mattocks, and shovels.
grimaud had only to make them a sign to go away, and i am convinced they
would have left us in peace."

"i doubt that," replied d’artagnan, "for they are advancing very
resolutely. besides, in addition to the pioneers, there are four
soldiers and a brigadier, armed with muskets."

"that’s because they don’t see us," said athos.

"my faith," said aramis, "i must confess i feel a great repugnance to
fire on these poor devils of civilians."

"he is a bad priest," said porthos, "who has pity for heretics."

"in truth," said athos, "aramis is right. i will warn them."

"what the devil are you going to do?" cried d’artagnan, "you will be
shot."

but athos heeded not his advice. mounting on the breach, with his musket
in one hand and his hat in the other, he said, bowing courteously and
addressing the soldiers and the pio

s from the bastion: "gentlemen, a few
friends and myself are about to breakfast in this bastion. now, you know
nothing is more disagreeable than being disturbed when one is at
breakfast. we request you, then, if you really have business here, to
wait till we have finished our repast, or to come again a short time
hence; unless, which would be far better, you form the salutary
resolution to quit the side of the rebels, and come and drink with us to
the health of the king of france."

"take care, athos!" cried d’artagnan; "don’t you see they are aiming?"

"yes, yes," said athos; "but they are only civilians--very bad marksmen,
who will be sure not to hit me."

in fact, at the same instant four shots were fired, and the balls were
flattened against the wall around athos, but not one touched him.

four shots replied to them almost instantaneously, but much better aimed
than those of the aggressors; three soldiers fell dead, and one of the
pioneers was wounded.

"grimaud," said athos, still 
 
 ___________________________
 
on the breach, "another musket!"

grimaud immediately obeyed. on their part, the three friends had
reloaded their arms; a second discharge followed the first. the
brigadier and two pioneers fell dead; the rest of the troop took to
flight.

"now, gentlemen, a sortie!" cried athos.

and the four friends rushed out of the fort, gained the field of battle,
picked up the four muskets of the privates and the half-pike of the
brigadier, and convinced that the fugitives would not stop till they
reached the city, turned again toward the bastion, bearing with them the
trophies of their victory.

"reload the muskets, grimaud," said athos, "and we, gentlemen, will go
on with our breakfast, and resume our conversation. where were we?"

"i recollect you were saying," said d’artagn

an, "that after having
demanded my head of the cardinal, milady had quit the shores of france.
whither goes she?" added he, strongly interested in the route milady
followed.

"she goes into england," said athos.

"with what view?"

"with the view of assassinating, or causing to be assassinated, the duke
of buckingham."

d’artagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and indignation.

"but this is infamous!" cried he.

"as to that," said athos, "i beg you to believe that i care very little
about it. now you have done, grimaud, take our brigadier’s half-pike,
tie a napkin to it, and plant it on top of our bastion, that these
rebels of rochellais may see that they have to deal with brave and loyal
soldiers of the king."

grimaud obeyed without replying. an instant afterward, the white flag
was floating over the heads of the four friends. a thunder of applause
saluted its appearance; half the camp was at the barrier.

"how?" replied d
 
 ___________________________
 
’artagnan, "you care little if she kills buckingham or
causes him to be killed? but the duke is our friend."

"the duke is english; the duke fights against us. let her do what she
likes with the duke; i care no more about him than an empty bottle." and
athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had
poured the last drop into his glass.

"a moment," said d’artagnan. "i will not abandon buckingham thus. he
gave us some very fine horses."

"and moreover, very handsome saddles," said porthos, who at the moment
wore on his cloak the lace of his own.

"besides," said aramis, "god desires the conversion and not the death of
a sinner."

"amen!" said athos, "and we will return to that subject later, if such
be your pleasure; but what

tagnan, was the
getting from this woman a kind of carte blanche which she had extorted
from the cardinal, and by means of which she could with impunity get rid
of you and perhaps of us."

"but this creature must be a demon!" said porthos, holding out his plate
to aramis, who was cutting up a fowl.

"and this carte blanche," said d’artagnan, "this carte blanche, does it
remain in her hands?"

"no, it passed into mine; i will not say without trouble, for if i did i
should tell a lie."

"my dear athos, i shall no longer count the number of times i am
indebted to you for my life."

"then it was to go to her that you left us?" said aramis.

"exactly."

"and you have that letter of the cardinal?" said d’artagnan.

"here it is," said athos; and he took the invaluable paper from the
pocket of his uniform. d’artagnan unfolded it with one hand, whose
trembling he did not even attempt to conceal, to read:

"dec. 3, 1627

"it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this

"richelieu"

"in fact," said aramis, "it is an absolution according to rule."

"that paper must be torn to pieces," said d’artagnan, who fancied he
read in it his sentence of death.

"on the contrary," said athos, "it must be preserved carefully. i would
not give up this paper if covered with as many gold pieces."

"and what will she do now?" asked the young man.

"why," replied athos, carelessly, "she is probably going to write to the
cardinal that a damned musketeer, named athos, has taken her
safe-conduct from her by force; she will advise him in the same letter
to get rid of his two friends, aramis and porthos, at the same time. the
cardinal will remember that these are the same men who have often
crossed his path; and then some fine morning he will arrest d’artagnan,
and for fear he should feel lonely, he will send us to keep him company
in the bastille."

"go to! it

appears to me you make dull jokes, my dear," said porthos.

"i do not jest," said athos.

"do you know," said porthos, "that to twist that damned milady’s neck
would be a smaller sin than to twist those of these poor devils of
huguenots, who have committed no other crime than singing in french the
psalms we sing in latin?"

"what says the abbe?" asked athos, quietly.

"i say i am entirely of porthos’s opinion," replied aramis.

"and i, too," said d’artagnan.

"fortunately, she is far off," said porthos, "for i confess she would
worry me if she were here."

"she worries me in england as well as in france," said athos.

"she worries me everywhere," said d’artagnan.

"but when you held her in your power, why did you not drown her,
strangle her, hang her?" said porthos. "it is only the dead who do not
return."

"you think so, porthos?" replied t

he musketeer, with a sad smile which
d’artagnan alone understood.

"i have an idea," said d’artagnan.

"what is it?" said the musketeers.

"to arms!" cried grimaud.

the young men sprang up, and seized their muskets.

this time a small troop advanced, consisting of from twenty to
twenty-five men; but they were not pioneers, they were soldiers of the
garrison.

"shall we return to the camp?" said porthos. "i don’t think the sides
are equal."

"impossible, for three reasons," replied athos. "the first, that we have
not finished breakfast; the second, that we still have some very
important things to say; and the third, that it yet wants ten minutes
before the lapse of the hour."

"well, then," said aramis, "we must form a plan of battle."

"that’s very simple," replied athos. "as soon as the enemy are within
musket shot, we must fire upon them. if they continue to advance, we
must fire again. we must fire as long as we have loaded guns. if those
who remain of the troop persist i

n coming to the assault, we will allow
the besiegers to get as far as the ditch, and then we will push down
upon their heads that strip of wall which keeps its perpendicular by a
miracle."

"bravo!" cried porthos. "decidedly, athos, you were born to be a
general, and the cardinal, who fancies himself a great soldier, is
nothing beside you."

"gentlemen," said athos, "no divided attention, i beg; let each one pick
out his man."

"i cover mine," said d’artagnan.

"and i mine," said porthos.

"and i mine," said aramis.

"fire, then," said athos.

the four muskets made but one report, but four men fell.

the drum immediately beat, and the little troop advanced at charging
pace.

then the shots were repeated without regularity, but always aimed with
the same accuracy. nevertheless, as if they had been aware of the
numerical weakness of the friends, the roche

with every three shots at least two men fell; but the march of those who
remained was not slackened.

arrived at the foot of the bastion, there were still more than a dozen
of the enemy. a last discharge welcomed them, but did not stop them;
they jumped into the ditch, and prepared to scale the breach.

"now, my friends," said athos, "finish them at a blow. to the wall; to
the wall!"

and the four friends, seconded by grimaud, pushed with the barrels of
their muskets an enormous sheet of the wall, which bent as if pushed by
the wind, and detaching itself from its base, fell with a horrible crash
into the ditch. then a fearful crash was heard; a cloud of dust mounted
toward the sky--and all was over!

"can we have destroyed them all, from the first to the last?" said
athos.

"my faith, it appears so!" said d’artagnan.

"n

o," cried porthos; "there go three or four, limping away."

in fact, three or four of these unfortunate men, covered with dirt and
blood, fled along the hollow way, and at length regained the city. these
were all who were left of the little troop.

athos looked at his watch.

"gentlemen," said he, "we have been here an hour, and our wager is won;
but we will be fair players. besides, d’artagnan has not told us his
idea yet."

and the musketeer, with his usual coolness, reseated himself before the
remains of the breakfast.

"my idea?" said d’artagnan.

"yes; you said you had an idea," said athos.

"oh, i remember," said d’artagnan. "well, i will go to england a second
time; i will go and find buckingham."

"you shall not do that, d’artag

nan," said athos, coolly.

"and why not? have i not been there once?"

"yes; but at that period we were not at war. at that period buckingham
was an ally, and not an enemy. what you would now do amounts to
treason."

d’artagnan perceived the force of this reasoning, and was silent.

"but," said porthos, "i think i have an idea, in my turn."

"silence for monsieur porthos’s idea!" said aramis.

"i will ask leave of absence of monsieur de treville, on some pretext or
other which you must invent; i am not very

does not know me; i will get access to her without her suspecting me,
and when i catch my beauty, i will strangle her."

"well," replied athos, "i am not far from approving the idea of monsieur
porthos."

"for shame!" said aramis. "kill a woman? no, listen to me; i have the
true idea."

"let us see your idea, aramis," said athos, who felt much deference for
the young musketeer.

"we must inform the queen."

"ah, my faith, yes!" said porthos and d’artagnan, at the same time; "we
are coming nearer to it now."

"inform the queen!" said athos; "and how? have we relations with the
court? could we send anyone to paris without its being known in the
camp? from here to paris it is a hundred and forty leagues; before our
letter was at angers we should be in a dungeon."

"as to remitting a letter with safety to her majesty," s

coloring, "i will take that upon myself. i know a clever person at
tours--"

aramis stopped on seeing athos smile.

"well, do you not adopt this means, athos?" said d’artagnan.

"i do not reject it altogether," said athos; "but i wish to remind
aramis that he cannot quit the camp, and that nobody but one of
ourselves is trustworthy; that two hours after the messenger has set
out, all the capuchins, all the police, all the black caps of the
cardinal, will know your letter by heart, and you and your clever person
will be arrested."

"without reckoning," objected porthos, "that the queen would save
monsieur de buckingham, but would take no heed of us."

"gentlemen," said d’artagnan, "what porthos says is full of 
 
 ___________________________
 
sense."

"ah, ah! but what’s going on in the city yonder?" said athos.

"they are beating the general alarm."

the four friends listened, and the sound of the drum plainly reached
them.

"you see, they are going to send a whole regiment against us," said
athos.

"you don’t think of holding out against a whole regiment, do you?" said
porthos.

"why not?" said the musketeer. "i feel myself quite in a humor for it;
and i would hold out before an army if we had taken the precaution to
bring a dozen more bottles of wine."

"upon my word, the drum draws near," said d’artagnan.

"let it come," said athos. "it is a quarter of an hour’s journey from
here to the city, consequently a quarter of an hour’s journey from the
city to hither. that is more tha

if we go from this place we shall never find another so suitable. ah,
stop! i have it, gentlemen; the right idea has just occurred to me."

"tell us."

"allow me to give grimaud some indispensable orders."

athos made a sign for his lackey to approach.

"grimaud," said athos, pointing to the bodies which lay under the wall
of the bastion, "take those gentlemen, set them up against the wall, put
their hats upon their heads, and their guns in their hands."

"oh, the great man!" cried d’artagnan. "i comprehend now."

"you comprehend?" said porthos.

"and do you comprehend, grimaud?" said aramis.

grimaud made a sign in the affirmative.

"that’s all that is necessary," said athos; "now for my idea."

"i should like, however, to comprehend," said porthos.

"that is 
 
 ___________________________
 
useless."

"yes, yes! athos’s idea!" cried aramis and d’artagnan, at the same time.

"this milady, this woman, this creature, this demon, has a
brother-in-law, as i think you told me, d’artagnan?"

"yes, i know him very well; and i also believe that he has not a very
warm affection for his sister-in-law."

"there is no harm in that. if he detested her, it would be all the
better," replied athos.

"in that case we are as well off as we wish."

"and yet," said porthos, "i would like to know what grimaud is about."

"silence, porthos!" said aramis.

"what is her brother-in-law’s name?"

"lord de winter."

"where is he now?"

"he returned to london at the first sound of war."

"well, there’s just the man we want," said athos. "it is he whom we must
warn. we will have him informed that his sister-in-law is on the point
of having someone assassinated, and beg him not to lose sight of he

r.
there is in london, i hope, some establishment like that of the
magdalens, or of the repentant daughters. he must place his sister in
one of these, and we shall be in peace."

"yes," said d’artagnan, "till she comes out."

"ah, my faith!" said athos, "you require too much, d’artagnan. i have
given you all i have, and i beg leave to tell you that this is the
bottom of my sack."

"but i think it would be still better," said aramis, "to inform the
queen and lord de winter at the same time."

"yes; but who is to carry the letter to tours, and who to london?"

"i answer for bazin," said aramis.

"and i for planchet," said d’artagnan.

"ay," said porthos, "if we cannot leave the camp, our lackeys may."

"to be sure they may; and this very da

y we will write the letters," said
aramis. "give the lackeys money, and they will start."

"we will give them money?" replied athos. "have you any money?"

the four friends looked at one another, and a cloud came over the brows
which but lately had been so cheerful.

"look out!" cried d’artagnan, "i see black points and red points moving
yonder. why did you talk of a regiment, athos? it is a veritable army!"

"my faith, yes," said athos; "there they are. see the sneaks come,
without drum or trumpet. ah, ah! have you finished, grimaud?"

grimaud made a sign in the affirmative, and pointed to a dozen bodies
which he had set up in the most picturesque attitudes. some carried
arms, others seemed to be taking aim, and the remainder appeared merely
to be sword in hand.

"bravo!" said athos; "that does honor to your imagination."

"all very well," said porthos, "but i should like to understand."

"let us decamp first, and you will un
 
 ___________________________
 
derstand afterward."

"a moment, gentlemen, a moment; give grimaud time to clear away the
breakfast."

"ah, ah!" said aramis, "the black points and the red points are visibly
enlarging. i am of d’artagnan’s opinion; we have no time to lose in
regaining our camp."

"my faith," said athos, "i have nothing to say against a retreat. we bet
upon one hour, and we have stayed an hour and a half. nothing can be
said; let us be off, gentlemen, let us be off!"

grimaud was already ahead, with the basket and the dessert. the four
friends followed, ten paces behind him.

"what the devil shall we do now, gentlemen?" cried athos.

"have you forgotten anything?" said aramis.

"the white flag, morbleu! we must not leave a flag in the hands of the
enemy, even if that flag be but a napkin."

d athos ran back to the bastion, mounted the platform, and bore off
the flag; but as the rochellais had arrived within musket range, they
opened a terrible fire upon this man, who appeared to expose himself for
pleasure’s sake.

but athos might be said to bear a charmed life. the balls passed and
whistled all around him; not one struck him.

athos waved his flag, turning his back on the guards of the city, and
saluting those of the camp. on both sides loud cries arose--on the one
side cries of anger, on the other cries of enthusiasm.

a second discharge followed the first, and three balls, by passing
through it, made the napkin really a flag. cries were heard from the
camp, "come down! come down!"

athos came down; his friends, who anxiously awaited him, saw him
returned with joy.

"come along, athos, come along!" cried d’artagnan; "no

w we have found
everything except money, it would be stupid to be killed."

but athos continued to march majestically, whatever remarks his
companions made; and they, finding their remarks useless, regulated
their pace by his.

grimaud and his basket were far in advance, out of the range of the
balls.

at the end of an instant they heard a furious fusillade.

"what’s that?" asked porthos, "what are they firing at now? i hear no
balls whistle, and i see nobody!"

"they are firing at the corpses," replied athos.

"but the dead cannot return their fire."

"certainly not! they wil

l then fancy it is an ambuscade, they will
deliberate; and by the time they have found out the pleasantry, we shall
be out of the range of their balls. that renders it useless to get a
pleurisy by too much haste."

"oh, i comprehend now," said the astonished porthos.

"that’s lucky," said athos, shrugging his shoulders.

on their part, the french, on seeing the four friends return at such a
step, uttered cries of enthusiasm.

at length a fresh discharge was heard, and this time the balls came
rattling among the stones around the four friends, and whistling sharply
in their ears. the rochellais had at last taken possession of the
bastion.

"these rochellais are bungling fellows," said athos; "how many have we
killed of them--a dozen?"

"or fifteen."

"how many did we crush under the wa

ll?"

"eight or ten."

"and in exchange for all that not even a scratch! ah, but what is the
matter with your hand, d’artagnan? it bleeds, seemingly."

"oh, it’s nothing," said d’artagnan.

"a spent ball?"

"not even that."

"what is it, then?"

we have said that athos loved d’artagnan like a child, and this somber
and inflexible personage felt the anxiety of a parent for the young man.

"only grazed a little," replied d’artagnan; "my fingers were caught
between two stones--that of the wall and that of my ring--and the skin
was broken."

"that comes of wearing diamonds, my master," said athos, disdainfully.

"ah, to be sure," cried porthos, "there is a diamond. why the devil,
then, do we plague ourselves about money, when there is a diamond?"

"stop a bit

!" said aramis.

"well thought of, porthos; this time you have an idea."

"undoubtedly," said porthos, drawing himself up at athos’s compliment;
"as there is a diamond, let us sell it."

"but," said d’artagnan, "it is the queen’s diamond."

"the stronger reason why it should be sold," replied athos. "the queen
saving monsieur de buckingham, her lover; nothing more just. the queen
saving us, her friends; nothing more moral. let us sell the diamond.
what says monsieur the abbe? i don’t ask porthos; his opinion has been
given."

"why, i think," said aramis, blushing as usual, "that his ring not
coming from a mistress, and consequently not being a love token,
d’artagnan may sell it."

"my dear aramis, you speak like theology personified. your advice, then,
is--"

"to sell the diamond," re

herefore, gentlemen, not a word more of this affair. we
are observed; they are coming to meet us. we shall be carried in
triumph."

in fact, as we have said, the whole camp was in motion. more than two
thousand persons had assisted, as at a spectacle, in this fortunate but
wild undertaking of the four friends--an undertaking of which they were
far from suspecting the real motive. nothing was heard but cries of
"live the musketeers! live the guards!" m. de busigny was the first to
come and shake athos by the hand, and acknowledge that the wager was
lost. the dragoon and the swiss followed him, and all their comrades
followed the dragoon and the swiss. there was nothing but felicitations,
pressures of the hand, and embraces; there was no end to the
inextinguishable laughter at the rochellais. the tumult at length became
so great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot, and sent la
houdiniere, his captain of the guards, to inquire what was going on.

the affair was described to the m

ffervescence of
enthusiasm.

"well?" asked the cardinal, on seeing la houdiniere return.

"well, monseigneur," replied the latter, "three musketeers and a
guardsman laid a wager with monsieur de busigny that they would go and
breakfast in the bastion st. gervais; and while breakfasting they held
it for two hours against the enemy, and have killed i don’t know how
many rochellais."

"did you inquire the names of those three musketeers?"

"yes, monseigneur."

"what are their names?"

"messieurs athos, porthos, and aramis."

"still my three brave fellows!" murmured the cardinal. "and the
guardsman?"

"d’artagnan."

"still my young scapegrace. positively, these four men must be on my
side."

the same evening the cardinal spoke to m. de treville of the exploit of
the morning, which was the talk of the whole camp. m. de treville, who
had received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes
of it, related it in all its details to his eminence, not forgetting the
episode of the n

 then, take him," said the cardinal; "when four men are so much
attached to one another, it is only fair that they should serve in the
same company."

that same evening m. de treville announced this good news to the three
musketeers and d’artagnan, inviting all four to breakfast with him next
morning.

d’artagnan was beside himself with joy. we know that the dream of his
life had been to become a musketeer. the three friends were likewise
greatly delighted.

"my faith," said d’artagnan to athos, "you had a triumphant idea! as you
said, we have acquired glory, and were enabled to carry on a
conversation of the highest importance."

"which we can resume now without anybody suspecting us, for, with the
help of god, we shall henceforth pass for cardinalists."

that evening d’artagnan went to present his respects to m. dessessart,
and inform him of his promotion.

m dessessart, who esteemed d’artagnan, made him offers of help, as this
change would entail expenses for equipment.

d’ar

tagnan refused; but thinking the opportunity a good one, he begged
him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued, as he wished to
turn it into money.

the next day, m. dessessart’s valet came to d’artagnan’s lodging, and
gave him a bag containing seven thousand livres.

this was the price of the queen’s diamond.




48 a family affair


athos had invented the phrase, family affair. a family affair was not
subject to the investigation of the cardinal; a family affair concerned
nobody. people might employ themselves in a family affair before all the
world. therefore athos had invented the phrase, family affair.

aramis had discovered the idea, the lackeys.

porthos had discovered the means, the diamond.

d’artagnan alone had discovered nothing--he, ordinarily the most
inventive of the four; but it must be also said that the very nam

le’s was as gay and cheerful as possible.
d’artagnan already wore his uniform--for being nearly of the same size
as aramis, and as aramis was so liberally paid by the publisher who
purchased his poem as to allow him to buy everything double, he sold his
friend a complete outfit.

d’artagnan would have been at the height of his wishes if he had not
constantly seen milady like a dark cloud hovering in the horizon.

after breakfast, it was agreed that they should meet again in the
evening at athos’s lodging, and there finish their plans.

d’artagnan passed the day in exhibiting his musketeer’s uniform in every
street of the camp.

in the evening, at the appointed hour, the four friends met. there only
remained three things to decide--what they should write to milady’s
brother; what they should write to the clever person at tours; and which
should be the lackeys to carry the letters.

everyone offered his own. athos talked of the discretion of grimaud, who
never spoke a word but w
 
 ___________________________
 
o was big enough to thrash four
men of ordinary size. aramis, confiding in the address of bazin, made a
pompous eulogium on his candidate. finally, d’artagnan had entire faith
in the bravery of planchet, and reminded them of the manner in which he
had conducted himself in the ticklish affair of boulogne.

these four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time, and gave
birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they
should be deemed too long.

"unfortunately," said athos, "he whom we send must possess in himself
alone the four qualities united."

"but where is such a lackey to be found?"

"not to be found!" cried athos. "i know it well, so take grimaud."

"take mousqueton."

"take bazin."

"take planchet. planchet is brave and shrewd; they are two qualities out
of the four."

"gentlemen," said aramis, "the principal question is not to know which
of our four lackeys is the most discreet, the most strong, the most
clever, or the most brave; the principal thing is
 
 ___________________________
 
 to know which loves
money the best."

"what aramis says is very sensible," replied athos; "we must speculate
upon the faults of people, and not upon their virtues. monsieur abbe,
you are a great moralist."

"doubtless," said aramis, "for we not only require to be well served in
order to succeed, but moreover, not to fail; for in case of failure,
heads are in question, not for our lackeys--"

"speak lower, aramis," said athos.

"that’s wise--not for the lackeys," resumed aramis, "but for the
master--for the masters, we may say. are our lackeys sufficiently
devoted to us to risk their lives for us? no."

"my faith," said d’artagnan. "i would almost answer for planchet."

"well, my dear friend, add to his natural devotedness a good sum of
money, and then, instead of answering for him once, answer for him
twice."

"why, good god! you will be deceived just the same," said athos, who was
an optimist when things were 
 
 ___________________________
 
concerned, and a pessimist when men were in
question. "they will promise everything for the sake of the money, and
on the road fear will prevent them from acting. once taken, they will be
pressed; when pressed, they will confess everything. what the devil! we
are not children. to reach england"--athos lowered his voice--"all
france, covered with spies and creatures of the cardinal, must be
crossed. a passport for embarkation must be obtained; and the party must
be acquainted with english in order to ask the way to london. really, i
think the thing very difficult."

"not at all," cried d’artagnan, who was anxious the matter should be
accomplished; "on the contrary, i think it very easy. it would be, no
doubt, parbleu, if we write to lord de winter about affairs of vast
importance, of the ho
 
 ___________________________
 
rrors of the cardinal--"

"speak lower!" said athos.

"--of intrigues and secrets of state," continued d’artagnan, complying
with the recommendation. "there can be no doubt we would all be broken
on the wheel; but for god’s sake, do not forget, as you yourself said,
athos, that we only write to him concerning a family affair; that we
only write to him to entreat that as soon as milady arrives in london he
will put it out of her power to injure us. i will write to him, then,
nearly in these terms."

"let us see," said athos, assuming in advance a critical look.

"monsieur and dear friend--"

"ah, yes! dear friend to an englishman," interrupted athos; "well
commenced! bravo, d’artagnan! only with that word you would be quartered
instead of being broken on the wh
 
 ___________________________
 
eel."

"well, perhaps. i will say, then, monsieur, quite short."

"you may even say, my lord," replied athos, who stickled for propriety.

"my lord, do you remember the little goat pasture of the luxembourg?"

"good, the luxembourg! one might believe this is an allusion to the
queen-mother! that’s ingenious," said athos.

"well, then, we will put simply, my lord, do you remember a certain
little enclosure where your life was spared?"

"my dear d’artagnan, you will never make anything but a very bad
secretary. where your life was spared! for shame! that’s unworthy. a man
of spirit is not to be reminded of such services. a benefit reproached
is an offense committed."

"the devil!" said d’artagnan, "you are insupportable. if the letter must
be written under your censure, my faith, i renounce the task."

"an

."

"well, so be it," said d’artagnan. "draw up this note for us, aramis;
but by our holy father the pope, cut it short, for i shall prune you in
my turn, i warn you."

"i ask no better," said aramis, with that ingenious air of confidence
which every poet has in himself; "but let me be properly acquainted with
the subject. i have heard here and there that this sister-in-law was a
hussy. i have obtained proof of it by listening to her conversation with
the cardinal."

"lower! sacre bleu!" said athos.

"but," continued aramis, "the details escape me."

"and me also," said porthos.

d’artagnan and athos looked at each other for some time in silence. at
length athos, after serious reflection and becoming more pale than
usual, made a sign of assent to d’artagnan, who by it understood he was
at liberty to speak.

"well, this is what you have to say," said d’artagnan: "my lord, your
sister-in-law is an infamous woman, who wished to have you killed that
she might inherit your wealth; but sh
 
 ___________________________
 
e could not marry your brother,
being already married in france, and having been--" d’artagnan stopped,
as if seeking for the word, and looked at athos.

"repudiated by her husband," said athos.

"because she had been branded," continued d’artagnan.

"bah!" cried porthos. "impossible! what do you say--that she wanted to
have her brother-in-law killed?"

"yes."

"she was married?" asked aramis.

"yes."

"and her husband found out that she had a fleur-de-lis on her shoulder?"
cried porthos.

"yes."

these three yeses had been pronounced by athos, each with a sadder
intonation.

"and who has seen this fleur-de-lis?" inquired aramis.

"d’artagnan and i. or rather, to observe the chron
 
 ___________________________
 
ological order, i and
d’artagnan," replied athos.

"and does the husband of this frightful creature still live?" said
aramis.

"he still lives."

"are you quite sure of it?"

"i am he."

there was a moment of cold silence, during which everyone was affected
according to his nature.

"this time," said athos, first breaking the silence, "d’artagnan has
given us an excellent program, and the letter must be written at once."

"the devil! you are right, athos," said aramis; "and it is a rather
difficult matter. the chancellor himself would be puzzled how to write
such a letter, and yet the chancellor draws up an official report very
readily. never mind! be silent, i will write."

aramis accordingly took the quill, reflected for a few moments, wrote
eight or ten lines in a charming little female hand, and then with a
voice soft and slow, as if each word had been scrupulously weighed, he
read the following:

"my lord, the person who writes these few l

ictim of a
near relative, whom you believe to be your heir because you are ignorant
that before she contracted a marriage in england she was already married
in france. but the third time, which is the present, you may succumb.
your relative left la rochelle for england during the night. watch her
arrival, for she has great and terrible projects. if you require to know
positively what she is capable of, read her past history on her left
shoulder."

"well, now that will do wonderfully well," said athos. "my dear aramis,
you have the pen of a secretary of state. lord de winter will now be
upon his guard if the letter should reach him; and even if it should
fall into the hands of the cardinal, we shall not be compromised. but as
the lackey who goes may make us believe he has been to london and may
stop at chatellerault, let us give him only half the sum promised him,
with the letter, with an agreement that he shall have the other half in
exchange for the reply. have you the diamond?" continued 
 
 ___________________________
 
athos.

"i have what is still better. i have the price;" and d’artagnan threw
the bag upon the table. at the sound of the gold aramis raised his eyes
and porthos started. as to athos, he remained unmoved.

"how much in that little bag?"

"seven thousand livres, in louis of twelve francs."

"seven thousand livres!" cried porthos. "that poor little diamond was
worth seven thousand livres?"

"it appears so," said athos, "since here they are. i don’t suppose that
our friend d’artagnan has added any of his own to the amount."

"but, gentlemen, in all this," said d’artagnan, "we do not think of the
queen. let us take some heed of the welfare of her dear buckingham. that
is the least we owe her."

"that’s true," said athos; "but that concerns aramis."

"well," replied the latter, blushing, "what must i say?"

"oh, that’s simple enough!" replied athos. "write a second letter for
that clever personage who
 
 ___________________________
 
 lives at tours."

aramis resumed his pen, reflected a little, and wrote the following
lines, which he immediately submitted to the approbation of his friends.

"my dear cousin."

"ah, ah!" said athos. "this clever person is your relative, then?"

"cousin-german."

"go on, to your cousin, then!"

aramis continued:

"my dear cousin, his eminence, the cardinal, whom god preserve for the
happiness of france and the confusion of the enemies of the kingdom, is
on the point of putting an end to the hectic rebellion of la rochelle.
it is probable that the succor of the english fleet will never even

to your sister, my dear cousin. i have dreamed that the unlucky
englishman was dead. i cannot recollect whether it was by steel or by
poison; only of this i am sure, i have dreamed he was dead, and you know
my dreams never deceive me. be assured, then, of seeing me soon return."

"capital!" cried athos; "you are the king of poets, my dear aramis. you
speak like the apocalypse, and you are as true as the gospel. there is
nothing now to do but to put the address to this letter."

"that is easily done," said aramis.

he folded the letter fancifully, and took up his pen and wrote:

"to mlle. michon, seamstress, tours."

the three friends looked at one another and laughed; they were caught.

"now," said aramis, "you will please to understand, gentlemen, that
bazin alone can carry this letter to to

und that sooner than relinquish
any possible means of vengeance, he will allow himself to be beaten to
death. if your arrangements at tours are your arrangements, aramis,
those of london are mine. i request, then, that planchet may be chosen,
more particularly as he has already been to london with me, and knows
how to speak correctly: london, sir, if you please, and my master, lord
d’artagnan. with that you may be satisfied he can make his way, both
going and returning."

"in that case," said athos, "planchet must receive seven hundred livres
for going, and seven hundred livres for coming back; and bazin, three
hundred livres for going, and three hundred livres for returning--that
will reduce the sum to five thousand livres. we will each take a
thousand livres to be employed as seems good, and we will leave a fund
of a thousand livres under the guardianship of monsieur abbe here, for
extraordinary occasions or common wants. will that do?"

"my dear athos," said aramis, "you speak like nes

everyone knows, the wisest among the greeks."

"well, then," said athos, "it is agreed. planchet and bazin shall go.
everything considered, i am not sorry to retain grimaud; he is
accustomed to my ways, and i am particular. yesterday’s affair must have
shaken him a little; his voyage would upset him quite."

planchet was sent for, and instructions were given him. the matter had
been named to him by d’artagnan, who in the first place pointed out the
money to him, then the glory, and then the danger.

"i will carry the letter in the lining of my coat," said planc

d’artagnan looked at his friends, as if to say, "well, what did i tell
you?"

"now," continued he, addressing planchet, "you have eight days to get an
interview with lord de winter; you have eight days to return--in all
sixteen days. if, on the sixteenth day after your departure, at eight
o’clock in the evening you are not here, no money--even if it be but
five minutes past eight."

"then, monsieur," said planchet, "you must buy me a watch."

"take this," said athos, with his usual careless generosity, giving him
his own, "and be a good lad. remember, if you talk, if you babble, if
you get drunk, you risk your master’s head, who has so much confidence
in your fidelity, and who answers for you. but remember, also, that if
by your fault any evil happens to d’artagnan, i will find you, wherever
you may be, for the purpose of ripping up your belly."

"oh, monsieur!" said planchet, humiliated by the suspicion, and
moreover, terrified at the calm air of the

poor michon; she
will never write like monsieur de voiture."

"what does you mean by boor michon?" said the swiss, who was chatting
with the four friends when the letter came.

"oh, pardieu, less than nothing," said aramis; "a charming little
seamstress, whom i love dearly and from whose hand i requested a few
lines as a sort of keepsake."

"the duvil!" said the swiss, "if she is as great a lady as her writing
is large, you are a lucky fellow, gomrade!"

aramis read the letter, and passed it to athos.

"see what she writes to me, athos," said he.

athos cast a glance over the epistle, and to disperse all the suspicions
that might have been created, read aloud:

"my cousin,

"my sister and i are skillful in interpreting dreams, and even entertain
great fear of them; but of yours it may be said, i hope, every dream is
an illusion. adieu! take care of yourself, and act so that we may from
time to time hear you spoken of.

"marie michon"

"and what dream does she mean?" asked the dragoon, who h

during the reading.

"yez; what’s the dream?" said the swiss.

"well, pardieu!" said aramis, "it was only this: i had a dream, and i
related it to her."

"yez, yez," said the swiss; "it’s simple enough to dell a dream, but i
neffer dream."

"you are very fortunate," said athos, rising; "i wish i could say as
much!"

"neffer," replied the swiss, enchanted that a man like athos could envy
him anything. "neffer, neffer!"

d’artagnan, seeing athos rise, did likewise, took his arm, and went out.

porthos and aramis remained behind to encounter the jokes of the dragoon
and the swiss.

as to bazin, he went and lay down on a truss of straw; and as he had
more imagination than the swiss, he dreamed that aramis, having become
pope, adorned his head with a cardinal’s hat.

but, as we have said, bazin had not, by his fortunate return, removed
more than a part of the uneasiness which weighed upon the four friends.

y slowness of navigation; he exaggerated to himself the power of
milady. he credited this woman, who appeared to him the equal of a
demon, with agents as supernatural as herself; at the least noise, he
imagined himself about to be arrested, and that planchet was being
brought back to be confronted with himself and his friends. still
further, his confidence in the worthy picard, at one time so great,
diminished day by day. this anxiety became so great that it even
extended to aramis and porthos. athos alone remained unmoved, as if no
danger hovered over him, and as if he breathed his customary atmosphere.

on the sixteenth day, in particular, these signs were so strong in
d’artagnan and his two friends that they could not remain quiet in one
place, and wandered about like ghosts on the road by which planchet was
expected.

"really," said athos to them, "you are not men but children, to let a
woman terrify you so! and what does it amount to, after all? to be
imprisoned. well, but we should

 on a violent catarrh. eh, gentlemen, let us reckon upon
accidents! life is a chaplet of little miseries which the philosopher
counts with a smile. be philosophers, as i am, gentlemen; sit down at
the table and let us drink. nothing makes the future look so bright as
surveying it through a glass of chambertin."

"that’s all very well," replied d’artagnan; "but i am tired of fearing
when i open a fresh bottle that the wine may come from the cellar of
milady."

"you are very fastidious," said athos; "such a beautiful woman!"

"a woman of mark!" said porthos, with his loud laugh.

athos started, passed his hand over his brow to remove the drops of
perspiration that burst forth, and rose in his turn with a nervous
movement he could not repress.

the day, however, passed away; and the evening came on slowly, but
finally it came. the bars were filled with drinkers. athos, who had
pocketed his share of the diamond, seldom quit the parpaillot. he had
found in m. de busigny, who, by the by, had 
 
 ___________________________
 
given them a magnificent
dinner, a partner worthy of his company. they were playing together, as
usual, when seven o’clock sounded; the patrol was heard passing to
double the posts. at half past seven the retreat was sounded.

"we are lost," said d’artagnan, in the ear of athos.

"you mean to say we have lost," said athos, quietly, drawing four
pistoles from his pocket and throwing them upon the table. "come,
gentlemen," said he, "they are beating the tattoo. let us to bed!"

and athos went out of the parpaillot, followed by d’artagnan. aramis
came behind, giving his arm to porthos. aramis mumbled verses to
himself, and porthos from time to time pulled a hair or two from his
mustache, in sign of despair.

but all at once a shadow appeared in the darkness the outline of which
was familiar to d’artagnan, and a well-known voice said, "monsieur, i
have brought your cloak; it is chilly this evening."

"planchet!" cried d’artagnan, beside himself with joy.

"planchet!" repeat

ed aramis and porthos.

"well, yes, planchet, to be sure," said athos, "what is there so
astonishing in that? he promised to be back by eight o’clock, and eight
is striking. bravo, planchet, you are a lad of your word, and if ever
you leave your master, i will promise you a place in my service."

"oh, no, never," said planchet, "i will never leave monsieur
d’artagnan."

at the same time d’artagnan felt that planchet slipped a note into his
hand.

d’artagnan felt a strong inclination to embrace planchet as he had
embraced him on his departure; but he feare
 
 ___________________________
 
d lest this mark of
affection, bestowed upon his lackey in the open street, might appear
extraordinary to passers-by, and he restrained himself.

"i have the note," said he to athos and to his friends.

"that’s well," said athos, "let us go home and read it."

the note burned the hand of d’artagnan. he wished to hasten their steps;
but athos took his arm and passed it under his own, and the young man
was forced to regulate his pace by that of his friend.

at length they reached the tent, lit a lamp, and while planchet stood at
the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised, d’artagnan,
with a trembling hand, broke the seal and opened the so anxiously
expected letter.

it contained half a line, in a hand perfectly british, and with a
conciseness as perfectly spartan:

thank you; be easy.

d’artagnan translated this fo

r the others.

athos took the letter from the hands of d’artagnan, approached the lamp,
set fire to the paper, and did not let go till it was reduced to a
cinder.

then, calling planchet, he said, "now, my lad, you may claim your seven
hundred livres, but you did not run much risk with such a note as that."

"i am not to blame for having tried every means to compress it," said
planchet.

"well!" cried d’artagnan, "tell us all about it."

"dame, that’s a long job, monsieur."

"you are right, planchet," said at

hos; "besides, the tattoo has been
sounded, and we should be observed if we kept a light burning much
longer than the others."

"so be it," said d’artagnan. "go to bed, planchet, and sleep soundly."

"my faith, monsieur! that will be the first time i have done so for
sixteen days."

"and me, too!" said d’artagnan.

"and me, too!" said porthos.

"and me, too!" said aramis.

"well, if you will have the truth, and me, too!" said athos.




49 fatality


meantime milady, drunk with passion, roaring on the deck like a lioness
that has been embarked, had been tempted to throw herself into the sea
that she might regain the coast, for she could not get rid of the
thought that she had been insulted by d’artagnan, threatened by athos,
and that she had quit france without being revenged on them. this idea
soon became so insupportable to her that at the risk of whatever
terrible consequences might result to herself from it, she imp

anxiously thoughtful, plunged her glance into the depths of possibility,
and discovered all the plan, of which she could not even obtain a glance
as long as she was ignorant into whose hands she had fallen. she knew
her brother-in-law to be a worthy gentleman, a bold hunter, an intrepid
player, enterprising with women, but by no means remarkable for his
skill in intrigues. how had he discovered her arrival, and caused her to
be seized? why did he detain her?

athos had dropped some words which proved that the conversation she had
with the cardinal had fallen into outside ears; but she could not
suppose that he had dug a countermine so promptly and so boldly. she
rather feared that her preceding operations in england might have been
discovered. buckingham might have guessed that it was she who had cut
off the two studs, and avenge himself for that little treachery; but
buckingham was incapable of going to any excess against a woman,

cahusac to stop, he alighted from his
horse, and went toward these suspected merry companions, hoping, by
means of the sand which deadened the sound of his steps and of the hedge
which concealed his approach, to catch some words of this conversation
which appeared so interesting. at ten paces from the hedge he recognized
the talkative gascon; and as he had already perceived that these men
were musketeers, he did not doubt that the three others were those
called the inseparables; that is to say, athos, porthos, and aramis.

it may be supposed that his desire to hear the conversation was
augmented by this discovery. his eyes took a strange expression, and
with the step of a tiger-cat he advanced toward the hedge; but he had
not been able to catch more than a few vague syllables without any
positive sense, when a sonorous and short cry made him start, and
attracted the attention of the musketeers.

"officer!" cried grimaud.

"you are speaking, you scoundrel!" said athos, rising upon his elbow,
 
 ___________________________
 
 flaming look.

grimaud therefore added nothing to his speech, but contented himself
with pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge, announcing
by this gesture the cardinal and his escort.

with a single bound the musketeers were on their feet, and saluted with
respect.

the cardinal seemed furious.

"it appears that messieurs the musketeers keep guard," said he. "are the
english expected by land, or do the musketeers consider themselves
superior officers?"

"monseigneur," replied athos, for amid the general fright he alone had
preserved the noble calmness and coolness that never forsook him,
"monseigneur, the musketeers, when they are not on duty, or when their
duty is over, drink and play at dice, and they are certainly superior
officers to their lackeys."

"lackeys?" grumbled the cardinal. "lackeys who have the order to warn
their masters when anyone passes are not lackeys, they are sentinels."

"your eminence may perceive that if we had not taken this precaution, we
should

 have been exposed to allowing you to pass without presenting you
our respects or offering you our thanks for the favor you have done us
in uniting us. d’artagnan," continued athos, "you, who but lately were
so anxious for such an opportunity for expressing your gratitude to
monseigneur, here it is; avail yourself of it."

these words were pronounced with that imperturbable phlegm which
distinguished athos in the hour of danger, and with that excessive
politeness which made of him at certain moments a king more majestic
than kings by birth.

d’artagnan came forward and stammered out a few words of gratitude which
soon expired under the gloomy looks of the cardinal.

"it does not signify, gentlemen," continued the cardinal, without
appearing to be in the least swerved from his first intention by the
diversion which athos had started, "it does not signify, gentlemen. i do
not like to have simple 
 
 ___________________________
 
soldiers, because they have the advantage of
serving in a privileged corps, thus to play the great lords; discipline
is the same for them as for everybody else."

athos allowed the cardinal to finish his sentence completely, and bowed
in sign of assent. then he resumed in his turn: "discipline,
monseigneur, has, i hope, in no way been forgotten by us. we are not on
duty, and we believed that not being on duty we were at liberty to
dispose of our time as we pleased. if we are so fortunate as to have
some particular duty to perform for your eminence, we are ready to obey
you. your eminence may perceive," continued athos, knitting his brow,
for this sort of inves

our muskets piled near
the drum, on which were the cards and dice.

"your eminence may believe," added d’artagnan, "that we would have come
to meet you, if we could have supposed it was monseigneur coming toward
us with so few attendants."

the cardinal bit his mustache, and even his lips a little.

"do you know what you look like, all together, as you are armed and
guarded by your lackeys?" said the cardinal. "you look like four
conspirators."

"oh, as to that, monseigneur, it is true," said athos; "we do conspire,
as your eminence might have seen the other morning. only we conspire
against the rochellais."

"ah, you gentlemen of policy!" replied the cardinal, knitting his brow
in his turn, "the secret of many unknown things might perhaps be found
in your brains, if we could read them as you read that letter which you
concealed as soon as you saw me coming."

the color mounted to the face of athos, and he made a step toward his
eminence.

"one might think you really suspected us, monseig

neur, and we were
undergoing a real interrogatory. if it be so, we trust your eminence
will deign to explain yourself, and we should then at least be
acquainted with our real position."

"and if it were an interrogatory!" replied the cardinal. "others besides
you have undergone such, monsieur athos, and have replied thereto."

"thus i have told your eminence that you had but to question us, and we
are ready to reply."

"what was that letter you were about to read, monsieur aramis, and which
you so promptly concealed?"

"a woman’s letter, monseigneur."

"ah, yes, i see," said the cardinal; "we must be discreet with this sort
of letters; but nevertheless, we may show them to a confessor, and you
know i have taken orders."

"monseigneur," said athos, with a calmness the more terrible becau

risked his head in making this reply, "the letter is a woman’s letter,
but it is neither signed marion de lorme, nor madame d’aiguillon."

the cardinal became as pale as death; lightning darted from his eyes. he
turned round as if to give an order to cahusac and houdiniere. athos saw
the movement; he made a step toward the muskets, upon which the other
three friends had fixed their eyes, like men ill-disposed to allow
themselves to be taken. the cardinalists were three; the musketeers,
lackeys included, were seven. he judged that the match would be so much
the less equal, if athos and his companions were really plotting; and by
one of those rapid turns which he always had at command, all his anger
faded away into a smile.

"well, well!" said he, "you are brave young men
 
 ___________________________
 
ttles, your game, and your letter. adieu,
gentlemen!"

and remounting his horse, which cahusac led to him, he saluted them with
his hand, and rode away.

the four young men, standing and motionless, followed him with their
eyes without speaking a single word until he had disappeared. then they
looked at one another.

the countenances of all gave evidence of terror, for notwithstanding the
friendly adieu of his eminence, they plainly perceived that the cardinal
went away with rage in his heart.

athos alone smiled, with a self-possessed, disdainful smile.

when the cardinal was out of hearing and sight, "that grimaud kept bad
watch!" cried porthos, who had a great inclination to vent his ill-humor
on somebody.

grimaud was about to reply to excuse himself. athos lifted his finger,
and grimaud was silent.

"would you have given up the letter, aramis?" said d’artagnan.

"i," said aramis, in his most flutelike tone, "i had made up my mind. if
he had insisted upon the letter being given up to 
 
 ___________________________
 
him, i would have
presented the letter to him with one hand, and with the other i would
have run my sword through his body."

"i expected as much," said athos; "and that was why i threw myself
between you and him. indeed, this man is very much to blame for talking
thus to other men; one would say he had never had to do with any but
women and children."

"my dear athos, i admire you, but nevertheless we were in the wrong,
after all."

"how, in the wrong?" said athos. "whose, then, is the air we breathe?
whose is the ocean upon which we look? whose is the sand upon which we
were reclining? whose is that letter of your mistress? do these belong
to the cardinal? upon my honor, this man fancies the world belongs to
him. there you stood, stammering, stupefied, annihilated. one might have
supposed the bastille appeared before you, and that the gigantic medusa
had converted you into stone. is being in love conspiring? you are in
love with a woman whom the cardina

l has caused to be shut up, and you
wish to get her out of the hands of the cardinal. that’s a match you are
playing with his eminence; this letter is your game. why should you
expose your game to your adversary? that is never done. let him find it
out if he can! we can find out his!"

"well, that’s all very sensible, athos," said d’artagnan.

"in that case, let there be no more question of what’s past, and let
aramis resume the letter from his cousin where the cardinal interrupted
him."

aramis drew the letter from his pocket; the three friends surrounded
him, and the three lackeys grouped themselves again near the wine jar.

"you had only read a line or two," said d’artagnan; "read the letter
again from the commencement."

"willingly," said aramis.

"my dear cousin,

a little reassured, having sent her secretary away in order that nothing
may happen unexpectedly.

"adieu, my dear cousin. tell us news of yourself as often as you can;
that is to say, as often as you can with safety. i embrace you.

"marie michon"

"oh, what do i not owe you, aramis?" said d’artagnan. "dear constance! i
have at length, then, intelligence of you. she lives; she is in safety
in a convent; she is at bethune! where is bethune, athos?"

"why, upon the frontiers of artois and of flanders. the siege once over,
we shall be able to make a tour in that direction."

"and that will not be long, it is to be hoped," said porthos; "for they
have this morning hanged a spy who confessed that the rochellais were
reduced to the leather of their shoes. supposing that after having eaten
the leather they eat the soles, i cannot see much that is left unless
they eat one another."

"poor fools!" said athos, emptying a glass of excellent borde

aux wine
which, without having at that period the reputation it now enjoys,
merited it no less, "poor fools! as if the catholic religion was not the
most advantageous and the most agreeable of all religions! all the
same," resumed he, after having clicked his tongue against his palate,
"they are brave fellows! but what the devil are you about, aramis?"
continued athos. "why, you are squeezing that letter into your pocket!"

"yes," said d’artagnan, "athos is right, it must be burned. and yet if
we burn it, who knows whether monsieur cardinal has not a secret to
interrogate ashes?"

"he must have one," said athos.

"what will you do with the letter, then?" asked porthos.

"come here, grimaud," said athos. grimaud rose and obeyed. "as a
punishment for having spoken without permission, my friend, you will
please to eat this piece of paper; then to recompense you for the
service you will have rendered us, you shall afterward drink this glass

. first, here is the letter. eat heartily."

grimaud smiled; and with his eyes fixed upon the glass which athos held
in his hand, he ground the paper well between his teeth and then
swallowed it.

"bravo, monsieur grimaud!" said athos; "and now take this. that’s well.
we dispense with your saying grace."

grimaud silently swallowed the glass of bordeaux wine; but his eyes,
raised toward heaven during this delicious occupation, spoke a language
which, though mute, was not the less expressive.

"and now," said athos, "unless monsieur cardinal should form the
ingenious idea of ripping up grimaud, i think we may be pretty much at
our ease respecting the letter."

meantime, his eminence continued his melancholy ride, murmuring

 ears, which porthos explained thus: "a very great lady
has told me that this means that somebody is talking of you somewhere."

at length the escort passed through paris on the twenty-third, in the
night. the king thanked m. de treville, and permitted him to distribute
furloughs for four days, on condition that the favored parties should
not appear in any public place, under penalty of the bastille.

the first four furloughs granted, as may be imagined, were to our four
friends. still further, athos obtained of m. de treville six days
instead of four, and introduced into these six days two more nights--for
they set out on the twenty-fourth at five o’clock in the evening, and as
a further kindness m. de treville post-dated the leave to the morning of
the twenty-fifth.

"good lord!" said d’artagnan, who, as we have often said, never stumbled
at anything. "it appears to me that we are making a great trouble of a
very simple thing. in two days, and by using up two or three horses

done for her, we shall obtain from the queen what we desire. remain,
then, where you are, and do not exhaust yourselves with useless fatigue.
myself and planchet are all that such a simple expedition requires."

to this athos replied quietly: "we also have money left--for i have not
yet drunk all my share of the diamond, and porthos and aramis have not
eaten all theirs. we can therefore use up four horses as well as one.
but consider, d’artagnan," added he, in a tone so solemn that it made
the young man shudder, "consider that bethune is a city where the
cardinal has given rendezvous to a woman who, wherever she goes, brings
misery with her. if you had only to deal with four men, d’artagnan, i
would allow you to

 go alone. you have to do with that woman! we four
will go; and i hope to god that with our four lackeys we may be in
sufficient number."

"you terrify me, athos!" cried d’artagnan. "my god! what do you fear?"

"everything!" replied athos.

d’artagnan examined the countenances of his companions, which, like that
of athos, wore an impression of deep anxiety; and they continued their
route as fast as their horses could carry them, but without adding
another word.

on the evening of the twenty-fifth, as they were entering arras, and as
d’artagnan was dismounting at the inn of the golden harrow to drink a
glass of wine, a horseman came out of the post yard, where he had just
had a relay, started off at a gallop, and with a fresh horse took the
road to paris. at the moment he passed through the gateway into the
st

of august, and lifted his hat, which the traveler
seized with his hand the moment it had left his head, pulling it eagerly
over his eyes.

d’artagnan, who had his eyes fixed upon this man, became very pale, and
let his glass fall.

"what is the matter, monsieur?" said planchet. "oh, come, gentlemen, my
master is ill!"

the three friends hastened toward d’artagnan, who, instead of being ill,
ran toward his horse. they stopped him at the door.

"well, where the devil are you going now?" cried athos.

"it is he!" cried d’artagnan, pale with anger, and with the sweat on his
brow, "it is he! let me overtake him!"

"he? what he?" asked athos.

"he, that man!"

"what man?"

"that cursed man, my evil genius, whom i have always met with when
threatened by some misfortune, he who accompanied that horrible woman
when i met her for the first time, he whom i was seeking when i offended
our athos, he whom i saw on the very morning madame bonacieux was
abducted. i have seen him; that is he! i recogn

ized him when the wind
blew upon his cloak."

"the devil!" said athos, musingly.

"to saddle, gentlemen! to saddle! let us pursue him, and we shall
overtake him!"

"my dear friend," said aramis, "remember that he goes in an opposite
direction from that in which we are going, that he has a fresh horse,
and ours are fatigued, so that we shall disable our own horses without
even a chance of overtaking him. let the man go, d’artagnan; let us save
the woman."

"monsieur, monsieur!" cried a hostler, running out and looking after the
stranger, "monsieur, here is a pap
 
 ___________________________
 
hat paper!"

"my faith, monsieur, with great pleasure! here it is!"

the hostler, enchanted with the good day’s work he had done, returned to
the yard. d’artagnan unfolded the paper.

"well?" eagerly demanded all his three friends.

"nothing but one word!" said d’artagnan.

"yes," said aramis, "but that one word is the name of some town or
village."

"armentieres," read porthos; "armentieres? i don’t know such a place."

"and that name of a town or village is written in her hand!" cried
athos.

"come on, come on!" said d’artagnan; "let us keep that paper carefully,
perhaps i have not thrown away my half-pistole. to horse, my friends, to
horse!"

and the four friends flew at a gallop along the road to bethune.




61 the carmelite convent at bethune


great criminals bear about them a kind of predestination which makes
them surmount all obstacles, which makes them escape all dangers, up to
the moment which a wearied providence has marked as the rock of their
impious fortunes.

erefore took leave of the abbess, and went to bed, softly rocked
by the ideas of vengeance which the name of kitty had naturally brought
to her thoughts. she remembered that almost unlimited promise which the
cardinal had given her if she succeeded in her enterprise. she had
succeeded; d’artagnan was then in her power!

one thing alone frightened her; that was the remembrance of her husband,
the comte de la fere, whom she had believed dead, or at least
expatriated, and whom she found again in athos-the best friend of
d’artagnan.

but alas, if he was the friend of d’artagnan, he must have lent him his
assistance in all the proceedings by whose aid the queen had defeated
the project of his eminence; if he was the friend of d’artagnan, he was
the enemy of the cardinal; and she doubtless would succeed in involving
him in the vengeance by which she hoped to destroy the young musketeer.

all these hopes were so many sweet thoughts for milady; so, rocked by
them, she soon fell asleep.

"with him, then, you must have seen some of his musketeers?"

"all those he is in the habit of receiving!" replied milady, for whom
this conversation began to have a real interest.

"name a few of those whom you know, and you will see if they are my
friends."

"well!" said milady, embarrassed, "i know monsieur de louvigny, monsieur
de courtivron, monsieur de ferussac."

the novice let her speak, then seeing that she paused, she said, "don’t
you know a gentleman named athos?"

milady became as pale as the sheets in which she was lying, and mistress
as she was of herself, could not help uttering a cry, seizing the hand
of the novice, and devouring her with looks.

"what is the matter? good god!" asked the poor woman, "have i said
anything that has wounded you?"

"no; but the name struck me, because i also have known that gentleman,
and it appeared strange to me to meet with a person who appears to know
him well."

"oh, yes, very well; not only him, but some of his

!"

"yes."

"well, then, tell him this, rochefort. tell him that our conversation at
the inn of the red dovecot was overheard by these four men; tell him
that after his departure one of them came up to me and took from me by
violence the safe-conduct which he had given me; tell him they warned
lord de winter of my journey to england; that this time they nearly
foiled my mission as they foiled the affair of the studs; tell him that
among these four men two only are to be feared--d’artagnan and athos;
tell him that the third, aramis, is the lover of madame de chevreuse--he
may be left alone, we know his secret, and it may be useful; as to the
fourth, porthos, he is a fool, a simpleton, a blustering booby, not
worth troubling himself about."

"but these four men must be now at the siege of la rochelle?"

"i thought so, too; but a letter which madame bonacieux has received
from madame the constable, and which she has had the imprudence to show
me, leads me to believe that these four men, on t

"well," said rochefort, taking the paper from milady, folding it, and
placing it in the lining of his hat, "you may be easy. i will do as
children do, for fear of losing the paper--repeat the name along the
route. now, is that all?"

"i believe so."

"let us see: buckingham dead or grievously wounded; your conversation
with the cardinal overheard by the four musketeers; lord de winter
warned of your arrival at portsmouth; d’artagnan and athos to the
bastille; aramis the lover of madame de chevreuse; porthos an ass;
madame bonacieux found again; to send you the chaise as soon as
possible; to place my lackey at your disposal; to make you out a victim
of the cardinal in order that the abbess may entertain no suspicion;
armentieres, on the banks of the lys. is that all, then?"

"in truth, my dear chevalier, you are a miracle of memory. a propos, add
one thing--"

"what?"

"i saw some very pretty woods which almost touch the convent gard

ized the voice of d’artagnan.

"d’artagnan! d’artagnan!" cried she, "is it you? this way! this way!"

"constance? constance?" replied the young man, "where are you? where are
you? my god!"

at the same moment the door of the cell yielded to a shock, rather than
opened; several men rushed into the chamber. mme. bonacieux had sunk
into an armchair, without the power of moving.

d’artagnan threw down a yet-smoking pistol which he held in his hand,
and fell on his knees before his mistress. athos replaced his in his
belt; porthos and aramis, who held their drawn swords in their hands,
returned them to their scabbards.

"oh, d’artagnan, my beloved d’artagnan! you have come, then, at last!
you have not deceived me! it is indeed thee!"

"yes, yes, constance. reunited!"

"oh, it was in vain she told me you would not come! i hoped in silence.
i was not willing to fly. oh, i have done well! how happy i am!"

at this word she, athos, who had seated himself quietly, started up.

"she! what

. "my god, can you not remember
her name?"

"yes, it was pronounced in my hearing once. stop--but--it is very
strange--oh, my god, my head swims! i cannot see!"

"help, help, my friends! her hands are icy cold," cried d’artagnan. "she
is ill! great god, she is losing her senses!"

while porthos was calling for help with all the power of his strong
voice, aramis ran to the table to get a glass of water; but he stopped
at seeing the horrible alteration that had taken place in the
countenance of athos, who, standing before the table, his hair rising
from his head, his eyes fixed in stupor, was looking at one of the
glasses, and appeared a prey to the most horrible doubt.

"oh!" said athos, "oh, no, it is impossible! god would not permit such a
crime!"

"water, water!" cried d’artagnan. "water!"

"oh, poor woman, poor woman!" murmured athos, in a broken voice.

mme. bonacieux opened her eyes under the kisses of d’artagnan.

"she revives!" cried the young man. "oh, my god, my god, i thank 
 
 ___________________________
 
thee!"

"madame!" said athos, "madame, in the name of heaven, whose empty glass
is this?"

"mine, monsieur," said the young woman, in a dying voice.

"but who poured the wine for you that was in this glass?"

"she."

"but who is she?"

"oh, i remember!" said mme. bonacieux, "the comtesse de winter."

the four friends uttered one and the same cry, but that of athos
dominated all the rest.

at that moment the countenance of mme. bonacieux became livid; a fearful
agony pervaded her frame, and she sank panting into the arms of porthos
and aramis.

d’artagnan seized the hands of athos with an anguish difficult to be
described.

"and what do you believe?’ his voice was stifled by sobs.

"i believe everything," said athos, biting his lips till the blood
sprang to avoid sighing.

"d’artagnan, d’artagnan!" cried mme. bonacieux, "where art thou? do not
lea
 
 ___________________________
 
ve me! you see i am dying!"

d’artagnan released the hands of athos which he still held clasped in
both his own, and hastened to her. her beautiful face was distorted with
agony; her glassy eyes had no longer their sight; a convulsive
shuddering shook her whole body; the sweat rolled from her brow.

"in the name of heaven, run, call! aramis! porthos! call for help!"

"useless!" said athos, "useless! for the poison which she pours there is
no antidote."

"yes, yes! help, help!" murmured mme. bonacieux; "help!"

then, collecting all her strength, she took the head of the young man
between her hands, looked at him for an instant as if her whole soul
passed into that look, and with a sobbing cry pressed her lips to his.

"constance, constance!" cried d’artagnan.

a sigh escaped from the mouth of mme. bonacieux, and dwelt for an
instant on the lips of d’artagnan. that sigh was th

e soul, so chaste and
so loving, which reascended to heaven.

d’artagnan pressed nothing but a corpse in his arms. the young man
uttered a cry, and fell by the side of his mistress as pale and as icy
as herself.

porthos wept; aramis pointed toward heaven; athos made the sign of the
cross.

at that moment a man appeared in the doorway, almost as pale as those in
the chamber. he looked around him and saw mme. bonacieux dead, and
d’artagnan in a swoon. he appeared just at that moment of stupor which
follows great catastrophes.

"i was not deceived," said he; "here is monsieur d’artagnan; and you are
his friends, messieurs athos, porthos, and aramis."

the persons whose names were thus pronounced looked at the stranger with
astonishment. it seemed to 
 
 ___________________________
 
woman who," added he, with a terrible smile, "must have passed this way,
for i see a corpse."

the three friends remained mute--for although the voice as well as the
countenance reminded them of someone they had seen, they could not
remember under what circumstances.

"gentlemen," continued the stranger, "since you do not recognize a man
who probably owes his life to you twice, i must name myself. i am lord
de winter, brother-in-law of that woman."

the three friends uttered a cry of surprise.

athos rose, and offering him his hand, "be welcome, my lord," said he,
"you are one of us."

"i set out five hours after her from portsmouth," said lord de winter.
"i arrived three hours after her at boulogne. i missed her by twenty
minutes at st. omer. finally, at lilliers i lost all trace of her. i was
going about at random, inquiring of everybody, when i saw you gallop
past. i recognized monsieur d’artagnan. i called to you, but you did not
answer me; i wished to follow you, but my horse was too
 
 ___________________________
 
 much fatigued to
go at the same pace with yours. and yet it appears, in spite of all your
diligence, you have arrived too late."

"you see!" said athos, pointing to mme. bonacieux dead, and to
d’artagnan, whom porthos and aramis were trying to recall to life.

"are they both dead?" asked lord de winter, sternly.

"no," replied athos, "fortunately monsieur d’artagnan has only fainted."

"ah, indeed, so much the better!" said lord de winter.

at that moment d’artagnan opened his eyes. he tore himself from the arms
of porthos and aramis, and threw himself like a madman on the corpse of
his mistress.

athos rose, walked toward his friend with a slow and solemn step,
embraced him tenderly, and as he burst into violent sobs, he said to him
with his noble and persuasive voice, "friend, be a man! women weep for
the dead; men a
 
 ___________________________
 
venge them!"

"oh, yes!" cried d’artagnan, "yes! if it be to avenge her, i am ready to
follow you."

athos profited by this moment of strength which the hope of vengeance
restored to his unfortunate friend to make a sign to porthos and aramis
to go and fetch the superior.

the two friends met her in the corridor, greatly troubled and much upset
by such strange events; she called some of the nuns, who against all
monastic custom found themselves in the presence of five men.

"madame," said athos, passing his arm under that of d’artagnan, "we
abandon to your pious care the body of that unfortunate woman. she was
an angel on earth before being an angel in heaven. treat her as one of
your sisters. we will return someday to pray over her grave."

d’artagnan concealed his face in the bosom of athos, and sobbed aloud.

"weep," said athos, "weep, heart full of love, youth, and life! alas,
would i could weep like you!"

and he drew away his friend, as affectionate as a father, as consoling
 
 ___________________________
 

as a priest, noble as a man who has suffered much.

all five, followed by their lackeys leading their horses, took their way
to the town of bethune, whose outskirts they perceived, and stopped
before the first inn they came to.

"but," said d’artagnan, "shall we not pursue that woman?"

"later," said athos. "i have measures to take."

"she will escape us," replied the young man; "she will escape us, and it
will be your fault, athos."

"i will be accountable for her," said athos.

d’artagnan had so much confidence in the word of his friend that he
lowered his head, and entered the inn without reply.

porthos and aramis regarded each other, not understanding this assurance
of athos.

lord de winter believed he spoke in this manner to soothe the grief of
d’artagnan.

"now, gentlemen," said athos, when he had ascertained there were five
chambers free in the hotel, "let everyone retire to his own apartment.
d’artagnan needs to be alone, to weep and to sleep. i take c

harge of
everything; be easy."

"it appears, however," said lord de winter, "if there are any measures
to take against the countess, it concerns me; she is my sister-in-law."

"and me," said athos, "--she is my wife!"

d’artagnan smiled--for he understood that athos was sure of his
vengeance when he revealed such a secret. porthos and aramis looked at
each other, and grew pale. lord de winter thought athos was mad.

"now, retire to your chambers," said athos, "and leave me to act. you
must perceive that in my quality of a husband this concerns me. only,
d’artagnan, if you have not lost it, give me the paper which fell from
that man’s hat, upon which is written the name of the village of--"

"ah," said d’artagnan, "i comprehend! that name written in her hand."

"you see, then," said athos, "there is a god in heaven still!"




64 the man in the red cloak


the despair of athos had given place to a concentrated grief which only
rendered more lu

faculties of that extraordinary
man.

possessed by one single thought--that of the promise he had made, and of
the responsibility he had taken--he retired last to his chamber, begged
the host to procure him a map of the province, bent over it, examined
every line traced upon it, perceived that there were four different
roads from bethune to armentieres, and summoned the lackeys.

planchet, grimaud, bazin, and mousqueton presented themselves, and
received clear, positive, and serious orders from athos.

they must set out the next morning at daybreak, and go to
armentieres--each by a different route. planchet, the most intelligent
of the four, was to follow that by which the carriage had gone upon
which the four friends had fired, and which was accompanied, as may be
remembered, by rochefort’s servant.

athos set the lackeys to work first because, since these men had been in
the service of himself and his friends he had discovered in each of them
different and essential qualities. then, lac

keys who ask questions
inspire less mistrust than masters, and meet with more sympathy among
those to whom they address themselves. besides, milady knew the masters,
and did not know the lackeys; on the contrary, the lackeys knew milady
perfectly.

all four were to meet the next day at eleven o’clock. if they had
discovered milady’s retreat, three were to remain on guard; the fourth
was to return to bethune in order to inform athos and serve as a guide
to the four friends. these arrangements made, the lackeys retired.

athos then arose from his chair, girded on his sword, enveloped himself
in his cloak, and left the hotel. it was nearly ten o’clock. at ten
o’clock in the evening, it is well known, the streets in provincial
towns are very little frequented. athos nevertheless was visibly anxious
to find someone of whom he could ask a question. at length he met a
belated passenger, went up to him, and spoke a few words 
 
 ___________________________
 
to him. the man
he addressed recoiled with terror, and only answered the few words of
the musketeer by pointing. athos offered the man half a pistole to
accompany him, but the man refused.

athos then plunged into the street the man had indicated with his
finger; but arriving at four crossroads, he stopped again, visibly
embarrassed. nevertheless, as the crossroads offered him a better chance
than any other place of meeting somebody, he stood still. in a few
minutes a night watch passed. athos repeated to him the same question he
had asked the first person he met. the night watch evinced the same
terror, refused, in his turn, to accompany athos, and only pointed with
his hand to the road he was to take.

athos walked in the direction indicated, and reached the suburb situated
at the opposite extremity of the city from that by which he and his
friends had entered it. there he again appeared uneasy and embarrassed,
and stopped for the third time.

fortunately, a mendicant passed, who,

coming up to athos to ask charity,
athos offered him half a crown to accompany him where he was going. the
mendicant hesitated at first, but at the sight of the piece of silver
which shone in the darkness he consented, and walked on before athos.

arrived at the angle of a street, he pointed to a small house, isolated,
solitary, and dismal. athos went toward the house, while the mendicant,
who had received his reward, left as fast as his legs could carry him.

athos went round the house before he could distinguish the door, amid
the red color in which the house was painted. no light appeared through
the chinks of the shutters; no noise gave reason to believe that it was
inhabited. it was dark and silent as the tomb.

three times athos knocked without receiving an answer. at the third
knock, however, steps were heard inside. the door at length was opened,
and a man appeared, of high stature, pale complexion, and black hair and
beard.

athos and he exchanged
 
 ___________________________
 
 some words in a low voice, then the tall man made
a sign to the musketeer that he might come in. athos immediately
profited by the permission, and the door was closed behind him.

the man whom athos had come so far to seek, and whom he had found with
so much trouble, introduced him into his laboratory, where he was
engaged in fastening together with iron wire the dry bones of a
skeleton. all the frame was adjusted except the head, which lay on the
table.

all the rest of the furniture indicated that the dweller in this house
occupied himself with the study of natural science. there were large
bottles filled with serpents, ticketed according to their species; dried
lizards shone like emeral

ds set in great squares of black wood, and
bunches of wild odoriferous herbs, doubtless possessed of virtues
unknown to common men, were fastened to the ceiling and hung down in the
corners of the apartment. there was no family, no servant; the tall man
alone inhabited this house.

athos cast a cold and indifferent glance upon the objects we have
described, and at the invitation of him whom he came to seek sat down
near him.

then he explained to him the cause of his visit, and the service he
required of him. but scarcely had he expressed his request when the
unknown, who remained standing before the musketeer, drew back with
signs of terror, and refused. then athos took from his pocket a small
paper, on which two lines were written, accompanied by a signature and a
seal, and p
 
 ___________________________
 
resented them to him who had made too prematurely these signs
of repugnance. the tall man had scarcely read these lines, seen the
signature, and recognized the seal, when he bowed to denote that he had
no longer any objection to make, and that he was ready to obey.

athos required no more. he arose, bowed, went out, returned by the same
way he came, re-entered the hotel, and went to his apartment.

at daybreak d’artagnan entered the chamber, and demanded what was to be
done.

"to wait," replied athos.

some minutes after, the superior of the convent sent to inform the
musketeers that the burial would take place at midday. as to the
poisoner, they had heard no tidings of her whatever, only that she must
have made her escape through the garden, on the sand of wh
 
 ___________________________
 
en, the grating of the
choir was closed. in the middle of the choir the body of the victim,
clothed in her novitiate dress, was exposed. on each side of the choir
and behind the gratings opening into the convent was assembled the whole
community of the carmelites, who listened to the divine service, and
mingled their chant with the chant of the priests, without seeing the
profane, or being seen by them.

at the door of the chapel d’artagnan felt his courage fall anew, and
returned to look for athos; but athos had disappeared.

faithful to his mission of vengeance, athos had requested to be
conducted to the garden; and there upon the sand following the light
steps of this woman, who left sharp tracks wherever she went, he
advanced toward the gate which led into the wood, and causing it to be
opened, he went out into the forest.

then all his suspicions were confirmed; the road by which the carriage
had disappeared encircled the forest. athos followed the road for some
time, his eyes fixed 
 
 ___________________________
 
 as a
courier, or from one of the horses, dotted the road. at the end of
three-quarters of a league, within fifty paces of festubert, a larger
bloodstain appeared; the ground was trampled by horses. between the
forest and this accursed spot, a little behind the trampled ground, was
the same track of small feet as in the garden; the carriage had stopped
here. at this spot milady had come out of the wood, and entered the
carriage.

satisfied with this discovery which confirmed all his suspicions, athos
returned to the hotel, and found planchet impatiently waiting for him.

everything was as athos had foreseen.

planchet had followed the road; like athos, he had discovered the stains
of blood; like athos, he had noted the spot where the horses had halted.
but he had gone farther than athos--for at the village of festubert,
while drinking at an inn, he had learned without needing to ask a
question that the evening before, at half-past eight, a wounded man who
accompanied a lady traveling in a p

 place, who was in search of a situation. he had not
chatted ten minutes with the people of the tavern before he learned that
a woman had come there alone about eleven o’clock the night before, had
engaged a chamber, had sent for the master of the hotel, and told him
she desired to remain some time in the neighborhood.

planchet had no need to learn more. he hastened to the rendezvous, found
the lackeys at their posts, placed them as sentinels at all the outlets
of the hotel, and came to find athos, who had just received this
information when his friends returned.

all their countenances were melancholy and gloomy, even the mild
countenance of aramis.

"what is to be done?" asked d’artagnan.

"to wait!" replied athos.

each retired to his own apartment.

at eight o’clock in the evening athos ordered the horses to be saddled,
and lord de winter and his friends notified that they must prepare for
the expedition.

in an instant all five were ready. each examined his arms, and put them
in
 
 ___________________________
 
 order. athos came down last, and found d’artagnan already on
horseback, and growing impatient.

"patience!" cried athos; "one of our party is still wanting."

the four horsemen looked round them with astonishment, for they sought
vainly in their minds to know who this other person could be.

at this moment planchet brought out athos’s horse; the musketeer leaped
lightly into the saddle.

"wait for me," cried he, "i will soon be back," and he set off at a
gallop.

in a quarter of an hour he returned, accompanied by a tall man, masked,
and wrapped in a large red cloak.

lord de winter and the three musketeers looked at one another
inquiringly. neither could give the others any information, for all were
ignorant who this man could be; nevertheless, they felt convinced that
all was as it should be, as it was done by the orde

r of athos.

at nine o’clock, guided by planchet, the little cavalcade set out,
taking the route the carriage had taken.

it was a melancholy sight--that of these six men, traveling in silence,
each plunged in his own thoughts, sad as despair, gloomy as
chastisement.




65 trial


it was a stormy and dark night; vast clouds covered the heavens,
concealing the stars; the moon would not rise till midnight.

occasionally, by the light of a flash of lightning which gleamed along
the horizon, the road stret
 
 ___________________________
 
ched itself before them, white and solitary;
the flash extinct, all remained in darkness.

every minute athos was forced to restrain d’artagnan, constantly in
advance of the little troop, and to beg him to keep in the line, which
in an instant he again departed from. he had but one thought--to go
forward; and he went.

they passed in silence through the little village of festubert, where
the wounded servant was, and then skirted the wood of richebourg. at
herlier, planchet, who led the column, turned to the left.

several times lord de winter, porthos, or aramis tried to talk with the
man in the red

ey did it
amid torrents of rain.

d’artagnan took off his hat, and could not be persuaded to make use of
his cloak. he found pleasure in feeling the water trickle over his
burning brow and over his body, agitated by feverish shudders.

the moment the little troop passed goskal and were approaching the post,
a man sheltered beneath a tree detached himself from the trunk with
which he had been confounded in the darkness, and advanced into the
middle of the road, putting his finger on his lips.

athos recognized grimaud.

"what’s the manner?" cried athos. "has she left armentieres?"

grimaud made a sign in the affirmative. d’artagnan ground his teeth.

"silence, d’artagnan!" said athos. "i have charged myself with this
affair. it is for me, then, to interrogate grimaud."

"where is she?" asked athos.

grimaud extended his hands in the direction of the lys. "far from here?"
asked athos.

grimaud showed his master his forefinger bent.

"alone?" asked athos.

grimaud made the sign yes.

"
 
 ___________________________
 
gentlemen," said athos, "she is alone within half a league of us, in
the direction of the river."

"that’s well," said d’artagnan. "lead us, grimaud."

grimaud took his course across the country, and acted as guide to the
cavalcade.

at the end of five hundred paces, more or less, they came to a rivulet,
which they forded.

by the aid of the lightning they perceived the village of erquinheim.

"is she there, grimaud?" asked athos.

grimaud shook his head negatively.

"silence, then!" cried athos.

and the troop continued their route.

another flash illuminated all around them. grimaud extended his arm, and
by the bluish splendor of the fiery serpent they distinguished a little
isolated house on the banks of the river, within a hundred paces of a
ferry.

one window was lighted.

"here we are!" said athos.

at this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and
came towards them. it was mousqueton. he pointed his finger to the
lighted window.

"she is there," said he.

"and

 bazin?" asked athos.

"while i watched the window, he guarded the door."

"good!" said athos. "you are good and faithful servants."

athos sprang from his horse, gave the bridle to grimaud, and advanced
toward the window, after having made a sign to the rest of the troop to
go toward the door.

the little house was surrounded by a low, quickset hedge, two or three
feet high. athos sprang over the hedge and went up to the window, which
was without shutters, but had the half-curtains closely drawn.

he mounted the skirting stone that his eyes might look over the curtain.

by the light of a lamp he saw a woman, wrapped in a dark mantle, seated
upon a stool near a dying fire. her elbows were placed upon a mean
table, and she leaned her head upon her two hands, which were white as
ivory.

he could not distinguish her countenance, but a sinister smile passed
over the lips of a

thos. he was not deceived; it was she whom he sought.

at this moment a horse neighed. milady raised her head, saw close to the
panes the pale face of athos, and screamed.

athos, perceiving that she knew him, pushed the window with his knee and
hand. the window yielded. the squares were broken to shivers; and athos,
like the spectre of vengeance, leaped into the room.

milady rushed to the door and opened it. more pale and menacing than
athos, d’artagnan stood on the threshold.

milady recoiled, uttering a cry. d’artagnan, believing she might have
means of flight and fearing she should escape, drew a pistol from his
belt; but athos raised his hand.

"put back that weapon, d’artagnan!" said he; "this woman must be tried,
not assassinated. wait an instant, my friend, and you shall be
satisfied. come in, gentlemen."

d’artagnan obeyed; for athos had the solemn voice and the powerful
gesture of a judge sent by the lord himself. 
 
 ___________________________
 
behind d’artagnan entered
porthos, aramis, lord de winter, and the man in the red cloak.

the four lackeys guarded the door and the window.

milady had sunk into a chair, with her hands extended, as if to conjure
this terrible apparition. perceiving her brother-in-law, she uttered a
terrible cry.

"what do you want?" screamed milady.

"we want," said athos, "charlotte backson, who first was called comtesse
de la fere, and afterwards milady de winter, baroness of sheffield."

"that is i! that is i!" murmured milady, in extreme terror; "what do you
want?"

"we wish to judge you according to your crime," said athos; "you shall
be free to defend yourself. justify yourself if you can. m. d’artagnan,
it is for you to accuse her first."

d’artagnan advanced.

"before god and before men," said he, "i accuse this woman of having

preserved me, but a man named brisemont died in my place."

"we bear witness to this," said porthos and aramis, in the same manner
as before.

"before god and before men, i accuse this woman of having urged me to
the murder of the baron de wardes; but as no one else can attest the
truth of this accusation, i attest it myself. i have done." and
d’artagnan passed to the other side of the room with porthos and aramis.

"your turn, my lord," said athos.

the baron came forward.

"before god and before men," said he, "i accuse this woman of having
caused the assassination of the duke of buckingham."

"the duke of buckingham assassinated!" cried all present, with one
voice.

"yes," said the baron, "assassinated. on receiving the warning letter
you wrote to me, i had this woman arrested, and gave her in charge to a
loyal servant. she corrupted this man; she placed the poniard in his
hand; she made him kill the duke. and at this moment, perhaps,

"horror!" cried porthos and aramis.

"assassin of buckingham, assassin of felton, assassin of my brother, i
demand justice upon you, and i swear that if it be not granted to me, i
will execute it myself."

and lord de winter ranged himself by the side of d’artagnan, leaving the
place free for another accuser.

milady let her head sink between her two hands, and tried to recall her
ideas, whirling in a mortal vertigo.

"my turn," said athos, himself trembling as the lion trembles at the
sight of the serpent--"my turn. i married that woman when she was a
young girl; i married her in opposition to the wishes of all my family;
i gave her my wealth, i gave her my name; and one day i discovered that
this woman was branded--this woman was marked with a fleur-de-lis on her
left shoulder."

"oh," said milady, raising herself, "i defy you to find any tribunal
which pronounced that infamous sentence against me. i defy you to find
him who ex

ecuted it."

"silence!" said a hollow voice. "it is for me to reply to that!" and the
man in the red cloak came forward in his turn.

"what man is that? what man is that?" cried milady, suffocated by
terror, her hair loosening itself, and rising above her livid
countenance as if alive.

all eyes were turned towards this man--for to all except athos he was
unknown.

even athos looked at him with as much stupefaction as the others, for he
knew not how he could in any way find himself mixed up with the horrible
drama then unfolded.

after approaching milady with a slow and solemn step, so that the table
alone separated them, the unknown took off his mask.

milady for some time examined with increasing terror that pale face,
framed with black hair and whiskers, the only expression of which was
icy impassibility. then she suddenly cried, "oh, no, no!" rising and
retreati

was ignorant of this sentence. he rejoined this woman; they fled
together into berry, and there he obtained a little curacy. this woman
passed for his sister.

"the lord of the estate on which the chapel of the curacy was situated
saw this pretend sister, and became enamoured of her--amorous to such a
degree that he proposed to marry her. then she quitted him she had
ruined for him she was destined to ruin, and became the comtesse de la
fere--"

all eyes were turned towards athos, whose real name that was, and who
made a sign with his head that all was true which the executioner had
said.

"then," resumed he, "mad, desperate, determined to get rid of an
existence from which she had stolen everything, honor and happiness, my
poor brother returned to lille, and learning the sentence which had
condemned me in his place, surrendered himself, and hanged himself that
same night from the iron bar of the loophole of his prison.

"to do justice to them who had condemned me, they

soon as the identity of my brother was proved, i was set at liberty.

"that is the crime of which i accuse her; that is the cause for which
she was branded."

"monsieur d’artagnan," said athos, "what is the penalty you demand
against this woman?"

"the punishment of death," replied d’artagnan.

"my lord de winter," continued athos, "what is the penalty you demand
against this woman?"

"the punishment of death," replied lord de winter.

"messieurs porthos and aramis," repeated athos, "you who are her judges,
what is the sentence you pronounce upon this woman?"

"the punishment of death," replied the musketeers, in a hollow voice.

milady uttered a frightful shriek, and dragged herself along several
paces upon her knees toward her judges.

athos stretched out his hand toward her.

"charlotte backson, comtesse de la fere, m
 
 ___________________________
 
es have wearied men on earth and god in heaven. if you know a
prayer, say it--for you are condemned, and you shall die."

at these words, which left no hope, milady raised herself in all her
pride, and wished to speak; but her strength failed her. she felt that a
powerful and implacable hand seized her by the hair, and dragged her
away as irrevocably as fatality drags humanity. she did not, therefore,
even attempt the least resistance, and went out of the cottage.

lord de winter, d’artagnan, athos, porthos, and aramis, went out close
behind her. the lackeys followed their masters, and the chamber was left
solitary, with its broken window, its open door, and its smoky lamp
burning sadly on the table.




66 execution


it was near midnight; the moon, lessened by its decline, and reddened by
the last traces of the storm, arose behind the little town of
armentieres, which showed against its pale light the dark outline of its
houses, and the skeleton of its high belfry. in front of them the

last.

the two lackeys conducted milady to the bank of the river. her mouth was
mute; but her eyes spoke with their inexpressible eloquence,
supplicating by turns each of those on whom she looked.

being a few paces in advance she whispered to the lackeys, "a thousand
pistoles to each of you, if you will assist my escape; but if you
deliver me up to your masters, i have near at hand avengers who will
make you pay dearly for my death."

grimaud hesitated. mousqueton trembled in all his members.

athos, who heard milady’s voice, came sharply up. lord de winter did the
same.

"change these lackeys," said he; "she has spoken to them. they are no
longer sure."

planchet and bazin were called, and took the places of grimaud and
mousqueton.

on the bank of the river the executioner approached milady, and bound
her hands and feet.

then she broke the silence to cry out, "you are cowards, miserable
assassins--ten men combined to murder one woman. beware! if i am not
saved i shall be avenged."

"yo

u are not a woman," said athos, coldly and sternly. "you do not
belong to the human species; you are a demon escaped from hell, whither
we send you back again."

"ah, you virtuous men!" said milady; "please to remember that he who
shall touch a hair of my head is himself an assassin."

"the executioner may kill, without being on that account an assassin,"
said the man in the red cloak, rapping upon his immense sword. "this is
the last judge; that is all. nachrichter, as say our neighbors, the
germans."

and as he bound her w

nd hung his head, covering his ears with the palms
of his hands; and yet, notwithstanding, he could still hear her cry and
threaten.

d’artagnan was the youngest of all these men. his heart failed him.

"oh, i cannot behold this frightful spectacle!" said he. "i cannot
consent that this woman should die thus!"

milady heard these few words and caught at a shadow of hope.

"d’artagnan, d’artagnan!" cried she; "remember that i loved you!"

the young man rose and took a step toward her.

but athos rose likewise, drew his sword, and placed himself in the way.

"if you take one step farther, d’artagnan," said he, "we shall cross
swords together."

d’artagnan sank on his knees and prayed.

"come," continued athos, "executioner, do your duty."

"willingly, monseigneur," said the executioner; "for as i am a good
catholic, i firmly believe i am acting justly in performing my functions
on this woman."

"that’s well."

athos made a step toward milady.

"i pardon you," said he, "the ill you

e murder of my poor love and your cruel vengeance against me. i
pardon you, and i weep for you. die in peace!"

"i am lost!" murmured milady in english. "i must die!"

then she arose of herself, and cast around her one of those piercing
looks which seemed to dart from an eye of flame.

she saw nothing; she listened, and she heard nothing.

"where am i to die?" said she.

"on the other bank," replied the executioner.

then he placed her in the boat, and as he was going to set foot in it
himself, athos handed him a sum of silver.

"here," said he, "is the price of the execution, that it may be plain we
act as judges."

"that is correct," said the executioner; "and now in her turn, let this
woman see that i am not fulfilling my trade, but my debt."

and he threw the money into the river.

the boat moved off toward the left-hand shore of the lys, bearing the
guilty woman and the executioner; all the others remained on the
right-hand bank, where they fell on their knees.

the boat glided along t

d the boat, and suspending his
burden over the water cried in a loud voice, "let the justice of god be
done!" and he let the corpse drop into the depths of the waters, which
closed over it.

three days afterward the four musketeers were in paris; they had not
exceeded their leave of absence, and that same evening they went to pay
their customary visit to m. de treville.

"well, gentlemen," said the brave captain, "i hope you have been well
amused during your excursion."

"prodigiously," replied athos in the name of himself and his comrades.




67 conclusion


on the sixth of the following month the king, in compliance with the
promise he had made the cardinal to return to la rochelle, left his
capital still in amazement at the news which began to spread itself of
buckingham’s assassination.

although warned that the man she had loved so much was in great danger,
the queen, when his death was announced to her, would not believe the
fact, and even imprudently exclaimed, "it is false; he ha

gain became dull and indisposed; his brow was not one
of those that long remain clear. he felt that in returning to camp he
should re-enter slavery; nevertheless, he did return.

the cardinal was for him the fascinating serpent, and himself the bird
which flies from branch to branch without power to escape.

the return to la rochelle, therefore, was profoundly dull. our four
friends, in particular, astonished their comrades; they traveled
together, side by side, with sad eyes and heads lowered. athos alone
from time to time raised his expansive brow; a flash kindled in his
eyes, and a bitter smile passed over his lips, then, like his comrades,
he sank again into reverie.

as soon as the escort arrived in a city, when they had conducted the
king to his quarters the four friends either retired to their own or to
some secluded cabaret, where they neither drank nor played; they only
conversed in a low voice, looking around attentively to see that no one
overheard them.

one day, when the king h

w! what do you say?" cried d’artagnan.

"i say that you must surrender your sword to me, monsieur, and that
without resistance. this concerns your head, i warn you."

"who are you, then?" demanded d’artagnan, lowering the point of his
sword, but without yet surrendering it.

"i am the chevalier de rochefort," answered the other, "the equerry of
monsieur le cardinal richelieu, and i have orders to conduct you to his
eminence."

"we are returning to his eminence, monsieur the chevalier," said athos,
advancing; "and you will please to accept the word of monsieur
d’artagnan that he will go straight to la rochelle."

"i must place him in the hands of guards who will take him into camp."

"we will be his guards, monsieur, upon our word as gentlemen; but
likewise, upon our word as gentlemen," added athos, knitting his brow,
"monsieur d’artagnan shall not leave us."

the chevalier de rochefort cast a glance backward, and saw that porthos
and aramis had placed themselves between him and the 
 
 ___________________________
 
gate; he understood
that he was completely at the mercy of these four men.

"gentlemen," said he, "if monsieur d’artagnan will surrender his sword
to me and join his word to yours, i shall be satisfied with your promise
to convey monsieur d’artagnan to the quarters of monseigneur the
cardinal."

"you have my word, monsieur, and here is my sword."

"this suits me the better," said rochefort, "as i wish to continue my
journey."

"if it is for the purpose of rejoining milady," said athos, coolly, "it
is useless; you will not find her."

"what has become of her, then?" asked rochefort, eagerly.

"return to camp and you shall know."

rochefort remained for a moment in thought; then, as they were only a
day’s journey from surgeres, whither the cardinal was to come to meet
the king, he resolved to follow the advice of athos and go with them.
besides, this return offered him the advantage of watching his prisoner.

they resumed their route.

on the morrow, at three o’clock in th

ook leave of the king, inviting him to come the next day to view the
work already done upon the dyke.

on returning in the evening to his quarters at the bridge of la pierre,
the cardinal found, standing before the house he occupied, d’artagnan,
without his sword, and the three musketeers armed.

this time, as he was well attended, he looked at them sternly, and made
a sign with his eye and hand for d’artagnan to follow him.

d’artagnan obeyed.

"we shall wait for you, d’artagnan," said athos, loud enough for the
cardinal to hear him.

his eminence bent his brow, stopped for an instant, and then kept on his
way without uttering a single word.

d’artagnan entered after the cardinal, and behind d’artagnan the door
was guarded.

his eminence entered the chamber which served him as a study, and made a
sign to rochefort to bring in the young musketeer.

rochefort obeyed and retired.

d’artagnan remained alone in front of the cardinal; this was his second
interview with richelieu, a

pocket. i content myself with saying: command, monseigneur; i am ready."

"your pardon?" said richelieu, surprised.

"yes, monseigneur," said d’artagnan.

"and signed by whom--by the king?" and the cardinal pronounced these
words with a singular expression of contempt.

"no, by your eminence."

"by me? you are insane, monsieur."

"monseigneur will doubtless recognize his own handwriting."

and d’artagnan presented to the cardinal the precious piece of paper
which athos had forced from milady, and which he had given to d’artagnan
to serve him as a safeguard.

his eminence took the paper, and read in a slow voice, dwelling upon
every syllable:

"dec. 3, 1627

"it is by my order and for the good of the state that the bearer of this
has done what he has done.

"richelieu"

the cardinal, after having read these two lines, sank into a profound
reverie; but he did not return the paper to d’artagnan.

"he is meditating by what sort of punishment he shall cause me
 
 ___________________________
 
 preserve your heads."

rochefort and d’artagnan coolly greeted each other with their lips; but
the cardinal was there, observing them with his vigilant eye.

they left the chamber at the same time.

"we shall meet again, shall we not, monsieur?"

"when you please," said d’artagnan.

"an opportunity will come," replied rochefort.

"hey?" said the cardinal, opening the door.

the two men smiled at each other, shook hands, and saluted his eminence.

"we were beginning to grow impatient," said athos.

"here i am, my friends," replied d’artagnan; "not only free, but in
favor."

"tell us about it."

"this evening; but for the moment, let us separate."

accordingly, that same evening d’artagnan repaired to the quarters of
athos, whom he found in a fair way to empty a bottle of spanish wine--an
occupation which he religiously accomplished every night.

d’artagnan related what had taken place between the cardinal and
himself, and drawing the commission from his pocket, said, "here, my
dea

r athos, this naturally belongs to you."

athos smiled with one of his sweet and expressive smiles.

"friend," said he, "for athos this is too much; for the comte de la fere
it is too little. keep the commission; it is yours. alas! you have
purchased it dearly enough."

d’artagnan left athos’s chamber and went to that of porthos. he found
him clothed in a magnificent dress covered with splendid embroidery,
admiring himself before a glass.

"ah, ah! is that you, dear friend?" exclaimed porthos. "how do you think
these garments fit me?"

"wonderfully," said d’artagnan; "but i come to offer you a dress which
will become you still better."

"what?" asked porthos.

"that of a lieutenant of musketeers."

d’artagnan related to porthos the substance of his interview with the
cardinal

ited it more than any of us by your wisdom and your counsels, always
followed by such happy results."

"alas, dear friend!" said aramis, "our late adventures have disgusted me
with military life. this time my determination is irrevocably taken.
after the siege i shall enter the house of the lazarists. keep the
commission, d’artagnan; the profession of arms suits you. you will be a
brave and adventurous captain."

d’artagnan, his eye moist with gratitude though beaming with joy, went
back to athos, whom he found still at table contemplating the charms of
his last glass of malaga by the light of his lamp.

"well," said he, "they likewise have refused me."

"that, dear friend, is because nobody is more worthy than yourself."

he took a quill, wrote the name of d’artagnan in the commission, and
returned it to him.

"i shall then have no more friends," said the young man. "alas! nothing
but bitter recollections."

and he let his head sink upon his hands, while two large tears rolled
down h

is cheeks.

"you are young," replied athos; "and your bitter recollections have time
to change themselves into sweet remembrances."




epilogue


la rochelle, deprived of the assistance of the english fleet and of the
diversion promised by buckingham, surrendered after a siege of a year.
on the twenty-eighth of october, 1628, the capitulation was signed.

the king made his entrance into paris on the twenty-third of december of
the same year. he was received in triumph, as if he came from conquering
an enemy and not frenchmen. he entere

thousand livres.

mousqueton had a magnificent livery, and enjoyed the satisfaction of
which he had been ambitious all his life--that of standing behind a
gilded carriage.

aramis, after a journey into lorraine, disappeared all at once, and
ceased to write to his friends; they learned at a later period through
mme. de chevreuse, who told it to two or three of her intimates, that,
yielding to his vocation, he had retired into a convent--only into
which, nobody knew.

bazin became a lay brother.

athos remained a musketeer under the command of d’artagnan till the year
1633, at which period, after a journey he made to touraine, he also quit
the service, under the pretext of having inherited a small property in
roussillon.

grimaud followed athos.

d’artagnan fought three times with rochefort, and wounded him three
times.

"i shall probably kill you the fourth," said he to him, holding out his
hand to assist him to rise.

"it is much better both for you and for me to stop where we are,"
