hat laconic,
consisting in the repetition of that name, united with the potent
adjective ‘motarkee’. but this was sufficient, and served to conciliate
the good will of the natives, with whom our congeniality of sentiment on
this point did more towards inspiring a friendly feeling than anything
else that could have happened.

at last the wrath of the chief evaporated, and in a few moments he
was as placid as ever. laying his hand upon his breast, he gave me to
understand that his name was ‘mehevi’, and that, in return, he wished me
to communicate my appellation. i hesitated for an instant, thinking that
it might be difficult for him to pronounce my real name, and then with
the most praiseworthy intentions intimated that i was known as ‘tom’.
but i could not have made a worse selection; the chief could not master
it. ‘tommo,’ ‘tomma’, ‘tommee’, everything but plain ‘tom’. as he
persisted in garnishing the word with an additional syllable, i
compromised the matter wi

receiving ours in return. during this ceremony the greatest merriment
prevailed nearly every announcement on the part of the islanders being
followed by a fresh sally of gaiety, which induced me to believe that
some of them at least were innocently diverting the company at our
expense, by bestowing upon themselves a string of absurd titles, of the
humour of which we were of course entirely ignorant.

all this occupied about an hour, when the throng having a little
diminished, i turned to mehevi and gave him to understand that we were
in need of food and sleep. immediately the attentive chief addressed a
few words to one of the crowd, who disappeared, and returned in a few
moments with a calabash of ‘poee-poee’, and two or three young cocoanuts
stripped of their husks, and with their shells partly broken. we both
of us forthwith placed one of these natural goblets to our lips, and
drained it in a moment of the refreshing draught it contained. the
poee-poee was then placed before us

g mass, and to the boisterous
mirth of the natives drew it forth laden with the poee-poee, which
adhered in lengthy strings to every finger. so stubborn was its
consistency, that in conveying my heavily-weighted hand to my mouth, the
connecting links almost raised the calabash from the mats on which it
had been placed. this display of awkwardness--in which, by-the-bye, toby
kept me company--convulsed the bystanders with uncontrollable laughter.

as soon as their merriment had somewhat subsided, mehevi, motioning us
to be attentive, dipped the forefinger of his right hand in the dish,
and giving it a rapid and scientific twirl, drew it out coated smoothly
with the preparation. with a second peculiar flourish he prevented the
poee-poee from dropping to the ground as he raised it to his mouth, into
which the finger was inserted and drawn forth perfectly free from any
adhesive matter.

this performance was evidently intended for our instruction; so i
again essayed the feat on the principles incu

 and myself reposed, while the rest of
the savages looked alternately from us to him, as if in expectation of
something they were disappointed in not perceiving. regarding the chief
attentively, i thought his lineaments appeared familiar to me. as
soon as his full face was turned upon me, and i again beheld its
extraordinary embellishment, and met the strange gaze to which i had
been subjected the preceding night, i immediately, in spite of the
alteration in his appearance, recognized the noble mehevi. on addressing
him, he advanced at once in the most cordial manner, and greeting me
warmly, seemed to enjoy not a little the effect his barbaric costume had
produced upon me.

i forthwith determined to secure, if possible, the good-will of this
individual, as i easily perceived he was a man of great authority in his
tribe, and one who might exert a powerful influence upon our subsequent
fate. in the endeavour i was not repulsed; for nothing could surpass
the friendliness he manifested towards b

but that which more than any other subject engaged his attention was
the late proceedings of the ‘frannee’ as he called the french, in the
neighbouring bay of nukuheva. this seemed a never-ending theme with him,
and one concerning which he was never weary of interrogating us. all the
information we succeeded in imparting to him on this subject was little
more than that we had seen six men-of-war lying in the hostile bay at
the time we had left it. when he received this intelligence, mehevi, by
the aid of his fingers, went through a long numerical calculation, as if
estimating the number of frenchmen the squadron might contain.

it was just after employing his faculties in this way that he happened
to notice the swelling in my limb. he immediately examined it with the
utmost attention, and after doing so, despatched a boy who happened to
be standing by with some message.

after the lapse of a few moments the stripling re-entered the house with
an aged islander, who might have been

his tottering steps were supported by a long slim staff, resembling the
wand with which a theatrical magician appears on the stage, and in
one hand he carried a freshly plaited fan of the green leaflets of the
cocoanut tree. a flowing robe of tappa, knotted over the shoulder, hung
loosely round his stooping form, and heightened the venerableness of his
aspect.

mehevi, saluting this old gentleman, motioned him to a seat between us,
and then uncovering my limb, desired him to examine it. the leech
gazed intently from me to toby, and then proceeded to business. after
diligently observing the ailing member, he commenced manipulating it;
and on the supposition probably that the complaint had deprived the leg
of all sensation, began to pinch and hammer it in such a manner that i
absolutely roared with pain. thinking that i was as capable of making
an application

of thumps and pinches to the part as any one else, i
endeavoured to resist this species of medical treatment. but it was
not so easy a matter to get out of the clutches of the old wizard; he
fastened on the unfortunate limb as if it were something for which he
had been long seeking, and muttering some kind of incantation continued
his discipline, pounding it after a fashion that set me well nigh crazy;
while mehevi, upon the same principle which prompts an affectionate
mother to hold a struggling child in a dentist’s chair, restrained me
in his powerful grasp, and actually encouraged the wretch in this
infliction of torture.

almost frantic with rage and pain, i yelled like a bedlamite; while
toby, throwing himself into all the attitudes of a posture-master,
vainly endeavoured to expostulate with the natives by signs and
gestures. to have looked at my companion, as, sympathizing with my
sufferings, he s

f anxious to make amends for the pain to which he had
subjected me, now took some herbs out of a little wallet that was
suspended from his waist, and moistening them in water, applied them
to the inflamed part, stooping over it at the same time, and either
whispering a spell, or having a little confidential chat with some
imaginary demon located in the calf of my leg. my limb was now swathed
in leafy bandages, and grateful to providence for the cessation of
hostilities, i was suffered to rest.

mehevi shortly after rose to depart; but before he went he spoke
authoritatively to one of the natives whom he addressed as kory-kory;
and from the little i could understand of what took place, pointed
him out to me as a man whose peculiar business thenceforth would be to
attend upon my person. i am not certain that i comprehended as much as
this at the time, but the subsequent conduct of my trusty body-servant
fully assured me that such must have been the case.

i could not but be amused at the manne

r in which the chief addressed me
upon this occasion, talking to me for at least fifteen or twenty minutes
as calmly as if i could understand every word that he said. i remarked
this peculiarity very often afterwards in many other of the islanders.

mehevi having now departed, and the family physician having likewise
made his exit, we were left about sunset with ten or twelve natives, who
by this time i had ascertained composed the household of which toby and
i were members. as the dwelling to which we had been first introduced
was the place of my permanent abode while i remained in the valley,
and as i was necessarily placed upon the most intimate footing with its
occupants, i may as well here enter into a little description of it

character, and one that ere long will be more fully alluded to.

though in my eyes, at least, fayaway was indisputably the loveliest
female i saw in typee, yet the description i have given of her will in
some measure apply to nearly all the youthful portion of her sex in the
valley. judge ye then, reader, what beautiful creatures they must have
been.

the natives were now sliding off into the water, diving and ducking
beneath the surface in all directions--the young girls springing
buoyantly into the air, and revealing their naked forms to the waist,
with their long tresses dancing about their shoulders, their eyes
sparkling like drops of dew in the sun, and their gay laughter pealing
forth at every frolicsome incident. on the afternoon of the day that i
took my first bath in the valley, we received another visit from mehevi.
the noble savage seemed to be in the same pleasant mood, and was quite
as cordial in his manner as before. after remaining about an hour, he
rose from the mats, and motioning to leave the house, invited toby and
myself to accompany him. i pointed to my leg; but mehevi in his turn
pointed to kory-kory, and removed that objection; so, mounting upon the
faithful fellow’s shoulders again--like the old man of the sea astride
of sindbad--i followed after the chief.

the nature of the route we now

descending on the other side into a steep glen, and crossing the flinty
channel of a brook. here it pursued the depths of a glade, occasionally
obliging you to stoop beneath vast horizontal branches; and now you
stepped over huge trunks and boughs that lay rotting across the track.

such was the grand thoroughfare of typee. after proceeding a little
distance along it--kory-kory panting and blowing with the weight of
his burden--i dismounted from his back, and grasping the long spear of
mehevi in my hand, assisted my steps over the numerous obstacles of
the road; preferring this mode of advance to one which, from the
difficulties of the way, was equally painful to myself and my wearied
servitor.

our journey was soon at an end; for, scaling a sudden height, we came
abruptly upon the place of our destination. i wish that it were possible
to sketch in words this spot as vividly as i recollect it.

here were situated the taboo groves of the valley--the scene of many a
prolonged feast, o

verandah, fenced in on the edge of the pi-pi with a picket of canes.
its interior presented the appearance of an immense lounging place, the
entire floor being strewn with successive layers of mats, lying between
parallel trunks of cocoanut trees, selected for the purpose from the
straightest and most symmetrical the vale afforded.

to this building, denominated in the language of the natives the ‘ti’,
mehevi now conducted us. thus far we had been accompanied by a troop of
the natives of both sexes; but as soon as we approached its vicinity,
the females gradually separated themselves from the crowd, and standing
aloof, permitted us to pass on. the merciless prohibitions of the
taboo extended likewise to this edifice, and were enforced by the
same dreadful penalty that secured the hoolah-hoolah ground from the
imaginary pollution of a woman’s presence.

on entering the house, i was surprised to see

on. this was doubtless attributable to
the fact, that during nearly a hundred years of existence the said toes
never had been subjected to any artificial confinement, and in their
old age, being averse to close neighbourhood, bid one another keep open
order.

these repulsive-looking creatures appeared to have lost the use of their
lower limbs altogether; sitting upon the floor cross-legged in a state
of torpor. they never heeded us in the least, scarcely looking conscious
of our presence, while mehevi seated us upon the mats, and kory-kory
gave utterance to some unintelligible gibberish.

in a few moments a boy entered with a wooden trencher of poee-poee; and
in regaling myself with its contents i was obliged again to submit to
the officious intervention of my indefatigable servitor. various other
dishes followed, the chief manifesting the most hospitable importunity
in pressing us to partake, and to remove all bashfulness on our part,
set us no despicable example in his own person.

 illuminated back-ground mounting the pi-pi and
approaching towards us.

they came on noiselessly, nay stealthily, and glided along through the
gloom that surrounded us as if about to spring upon some object they
were fearful of disturbing before they should make sure of it.--gracious
heaven! the horrible reflections which crowded upon me that moment.--a
cold sweat stood upon my brow, and spell-bound with terror i awaited my
fate!

suddenly the silence was broken by the well-remembered tones of mehevi,
and at the kindly accents of his voice my fears were immediately
dissipated. ‘tommo, toby, ki ki!’ (eat). he had waited to address us,
until he had assured himself that we were both awake, at which he seemed
somewhat surprised.

‘ki ki! is it?’ said toby in his gruff tones; ‘well, cook us first, will
you--but what’s this?’ he added, as another savage appeared, bearing
before him a large trencher of wood containing some kind of steaming
meat, as appeared from the odours it diffuse

the feet of mehevi. ‘a baked baby, i dare say i but i will have none

indeed, waked up here in the middle of the night, stuffing and guzzling,
and all to make a fat meal for a parcel of booby-minded cannibals one
of these mornings!--no, i see what they are at very plainly, so i am
resolved to starve myself into a bunch of bones and gristle, and then,
if they serve me up, they are welcome! but i say, tommo, you are not
going to eat any of that

, very much
like veal.’

‘a baked baby, by the soul of captain cook!’ burst forth toby, with
amazing vehemence; ‘veal? why there never was a calf on the island
till you landed. i tell you you are bolting down mouthfuls from a dead
happar’s carcass, as sure as you live, and no mistake!’

emetics and lukewarm water! what a sensation in the abdominal region!
sure enough, where could the fiends incarnate have obtained meat? but i
resolved to satisfy myself at all hazards; and turning to mehevi, i soon
made the ready chief understand that i wished a light to be brought.
when the taper came, i gazed eagerly into the vessel, and recognized the
mutilated remains of a juvenile porker! ‘puarkee!’ exclaimed kory-kory,
looking complacently at the dish; and from that day to this i have never
forgotten that such is the designation of a pig in the typee lingo.

the next morning, after being again abundantly feasted by the hospitable
mehevi, toby and myself arose to depart. but the chief req

filled with the young fruit of the tree, the naked shells stripped of
their husks peeping forth from the verdant wicker-work that surrounded
them. last of all came a burly islander, holding over his head a wooden
trencher, in which lay disposed the remnants of our midnight feast,
hidden from view, however, by a covering of bread-fruit leaves.

astonished as i was at this exhibition, i could not avoid smiling at
its grotesque appearance, and the associations it naturally called
up. mehevi, it seemed, was bent on replenishing old marheyo’s larder,
fearful perhaps that without this precaution his guests might not fare
as well as they could desire.

as soon as i descended from the pi-pi, the procession formed anew,
enclosing us in its centre; where i remained part of the time, carried
by kory-kory, and occasionally relieving him from his burden by limping
along with spear. when we moved off in this order, the natives struck
up a musical recitative, which with various alternations

, they continued
until we arrived at the place of our destination.

as we proceeded on our way, bands of young girls, darting from the
surrounding groves, hung upon our skirts, and accompanied us with shouts
of merriment and delight, which almost drowned the deep notes of the
recitative. on approaching old marheyo’s domicile, its inmates rushed
out to receive us; and while the gifts of mehevi were being disposed of,
the superannuated warrior did the honours of his mansion with all the
warmth of hospitality evinced by an english squire when he regales his
friends at some fine old patrimonial mansion.

attempt to procure relief from nukuheva--perilous adventure of toby in

amidst these novel scenes a week passed away almost imperceptibly. the
natives, actuated by some mysterious impulse, day after day redoubled

 other, would interpose every possible obstacle to my
leaving them.

one morning there was no little excitement evinced by the people near
my abode, and which i soon discovered proceeded from a vague report
that boats, had been seen at a great distance approaching the bay.
immediately all was bustle and animation. it so happened that day that
the pain i suffered having somewhat abated, and feeling in much better
spirits than usual, i had complied with kory-kory’s invitation to visit
the chief mehevi at the place called the ‘ti’, which i have before
described as being situated within the precincts of the taboo groves.
these sacred recesses were at no great distance from marheyo’s
habitation, and lay between it and the sea; the path that conducted to
the beach passing directly in front of the ti, and thence skirting along
the border of the groves.

i was reposing upon the mats, within the sacred building, in company
with mehevi and several other chiefs, when the announcement was first

made. it sent a thrill of joy through my whole frame;--perhaps toby was
about to return. i rose at once to my feet, and my instinctive impulse
was to hurry down to the beach, equally regardless of the distance that
separated me from it, and of my disabled condition. as soon as mehevi
noticed the effect the intelligence had produced upon me, and the
impatience i betrayed to reach the sea, his countenance assumed that
inflexible rigidity of expression which had so awed me on the afternoon
of our arrival at the house of marheyo. as i was proceeding to leave
the ti, he laid his hand upon my shoulder, and said gravely, ‘abo, abo’
(wait, wait). solely intent upon the one thought that occupied my mind,
and heedless of his request, i was brushing past him, when suddenly he
assu

med a tone of authority, and told me to ‘moee’ (sit down). though
struck by the alteration in his demeanour, the excitement under which i
laboured was too strong to permit me to obey the unexpected command,
and i was still limping towards the edge of the pi-pi with kory-kory
clinging to one arm in his efforts to restrain me, when the natives
around started to their feet, ranged themselves along the open front of
the building, while mehevi looked at me scowlingly, and reiterated his
commands still more sternly.

it was at this moment, when fifty savage countenances were glaring upon
me, that i first truly experienced i was indeed a captive in the
valley. the conviction rushed upon me with staggering force, and i was
overwhelmed by this confirmation of my worst fears. i saw at once that
it was useless for me to resist, and sick at heart, i reseated myself
upon the mats, and for the moment abandoned myself to despair.

i now percei

 was going on.

as for kory-kory, he appeared to think that we were in the midst of
great events, and sought most zealously to impress me with a due sense
of their importance. every sound that reached us conveyed some momentous
item of intelligence to him. at such times, as if he were gifted with
second sight, he would go through a variety of pantomimic illustrations,
showing me the precise manner in which the redoubtable typees were at
that very moment chastising the insolence of the enemy. ‘mehevi hanna
pippee nuee happar,’ he exclaimed every five minutes, giving me to
understand that under that distinguished captain the warriors of his
nation were performing prodigies of valour.

having heard only four reports from the muskets, i was led to believe
that they were worked by the islanders in the same manner as the sultan
solyman’s ponderous artillery at the siege of byzantium, one of them
taking an hour or two to load and train. at last, no sound whatever
proceeding from the mountains

s i understood it, implied that the
result exactly agreed with his expectations, and which, moreover,
was intended to convince me that it would be a perfectly useless
undertaking, even for an army of fire-eaters, to offer battle to the
irresistible heroes of our valley. in all this i of course acquiesced,
and looked forward with no little interest to the return of the
conquerors, whose victory i feared might not have been purchased without
cost to themselves.

but here i was again mistaken; for mehevi, in conducting his warlike
operations, rather inclined to the fabian than to the bonapartean
tactics, husbanding his resources and exposing his troops to no
unnecessary hazards. the total loss of the victors in this obstinately
contested affair was, in killed, wounded, and missing--one forefinger
and part of a thumb-nail (which the late proprietor brought along with
him in his hand), a severely contused arm, and a considerable effusion
of blood flowing from the thigh of a chief, who had receive
 
 ___________________________
 
s its results came under my
observation: and as it appeared to be considered an event of prodigious
importance, i reasonably concluded that the wars of the natives were
marked by no very sanguinary traits. i afterwards learned how the
skirmish had originated. a number of the happars had been discovered
prowling for no good purpose on the typee side of the mountain; the
alarm sounded, and the invaders, after a protracted resistance, had been
chased over the frontier. but why had not the intrepid mehevi carried
the war into happar? why had he not made a descent into the hostile
vale, and brought away some trophy of his victory--some materials for
the cannibal entertainment which i had heard usually terminated every
engagement? after all, i was much inclined to believe that these
shocking festivals must occur very rarely among the islanders, if,
indeed, they ever take place.

for two or three days the late event was the theme of general comment;
after which the excitement gradually wore away, a

fayaway to get into it, and paddle with me about the lake. this latter
proposition completely horrified kory-kory’s notions of propriety. he
inveighed against it, as something too monstrous to be thought of. it
not only shocked their established notions of propriety, but was at
variance with all their religious ordinances.

however, although the ‘taboo’ was a ticklish thing to meddle with, i
determined to test its capabilities of resisting an attack. i consulted
the chief mehevi, who endeavoured to dissuade me from my object; but
i was not to be repulsed; and accordingly increased the warmth of my
solicitations. at last he entered into a long, and i have no doubt a
very learned and eloquent exposition of the history and nature of the
‘taboo’ as affecting this particular case; employing a variety of most
extraordinary words, which, from their amazing length and sonorousness,
i have every reason to believe were of a theological nature. but all
that he said failed to

of the unchangeable
determination of the islanders. marnoo told me with evident alarm in his
countenance, that although admitted into the bay on a friendly footing
with its inhabitants, he could not presume to meddle with their
concerns, as such procedure, if persisted in, would at once absolve
the typees from the restraints of the ‘taboo’, although so long as
he refrained from such conduct, it screened him effectually from the
consequences of the enmity they bore his tribe. at this moment, mehevi,
who was present, angrily interrupted him; and the words which he uttered
in a commanding tone, evidently meant that he must at once cease talking
to me and withdraw to the other part of the house. marnoo immediately
started up, hurriedly enjoining me not to address him again, and as i
valued my safety, to refrain from all further allusion to the subject of
my departure; and then, in compliance with the order of the determined
chief, but not before it had again been angrily repeated, he withdre

emotions of the soul, and the imperfections of their oral language
are more than compensated for by the nervous eloquence of their looks
and gestures. i could plainly trace, in every varying expression of
their faces, all those passions which had been thus unexpectedly aroused
in their bosoms.

it required no reflection to convince me, from what was going on, that
the injunction of marnoo was not to be rashly slighted; and accordingly,
great as was the effort to suppress my feelings, i accosted mehevi in
a good-humoured tone, with a view of dissipating any ill impression
he might have received. but the ireful, angry chief was not so easily
mollified. he rejected my advances with that peculiarly stern expression
i have before described, and took care by the whole of his behaviour
towards me to show the displeasure and resentment which he felt.

marnoo, at the other extremity of the house, apparently desirous of
making a diversion in my favour, exerted himself to amuse with his
pleasantries th

by him. and yet despite all this, a few
words urged in my behalf, with the intent of obtaining my release from
captivity, had sufficed not only to banish all harmony and good-will;
but, if i could believe what he told me, had gone on to endanger his own
personal safety.

how strongly rooted, then, must be the determination of the typees
with regard to me, and how suddenly could they display the strangest
passions! the mere suggestion of my departure had estranged from me,
for the time at least, mehevi, who was the most influential of all
the chiefs, and who had previously exhibited so many instances of his
friendly sentiments. the rest of the natives had likewise evinced their
strong repugnance to my wishes, and even kory-kory himself seemed to
share in the general disapprobation bestowed upon me.

in vain i racked my invention to find out some motive for them, but i
could discover none.

but however this might be, the scene which had just occurred admonished

nutritious fruit served from day to day to diversify the meal, which was
finished by tossing off the liquid contents of a young cocoanut or two.

while partaking of this simple repast, the inmates of marheyo’s house,
after the style of the ancient romans, reclined in sociable groups upon
the divan of mats, and digestion was promoted by cheerful conversation.

after the morning meal was concluded, pipes were lighted; and among them
my own especial pipe, a present from the noble mehevi.

the islanders, who only smoke a whiff or two at a time, and at long
intervals, and who keep their pipes going from hand to hand continually,
regarded my systematic smoking of four or five pipefuls of tobacco in
succession, as something quite wonderful. when two or three pipes had
circulated freely, the company gradually broke up. marheyo went to the
little hut he was forever building. tinor began to inspect her rolls of
tappa, or employed her busy fingers in plaiting grass-mats. the girls

had recourse to their pipes, and then made preparations for the most
important meal of the day.

i, however, like those gentlemen of leisure who breakfast at home and
dine at their club, almost invariably, during my intervals of health,
enjoyed the afternoon repast with the bachelor chiefs of the ti, who
were always rejoiced to see me, and lavishly spread before me all the
good things which their larder afforded. mehevi generally introduced
among other dainties a baked pig, an article which i have every reason
to suppose was provided for my sole gratification.

the ti was a right jovial place. it did my heart, as well as my body,
good to visit it. secure from female intrusion, there was no restraint
upon the hilarity of the warriors, who, like the gentlemen of europe
after the cloth is drawn and the ladies retire, freely indulged their
mirth.

preparations for a grand festival in the valley--strange doings in
the taboo groves--monument of calabashes--gala costume of the typee
damsels--departure for the festival

from the time that my lameness had decreased i had made a daily practice
of visiting mehevi at the ti, who invariably gave me a most cordial
reception. i was always accompanied in these excursions by fayaway
and the ever-present kory-kory. the former, as soon as we reached the
vicinity of the ti--which was rigorously tabooed to the whole female
sex--withdrew to a neighbouring hut, as if her feminine delicacy
‘restricted’ her from approaching a habitation which might be regarded
as a sort of bachelor’s hall.

and in good truth it might well have been so considered. although it

s the permanent residence of several distinguished chiefs, and of
the noble mehevi in particular, it was still at certain seasons the
favourite haunt of all the jolly, talkative, and elderly savages of
the vale, who resorted thither in the same way that similar characters
frequent a tavern in civilized countries. there they would remain hour
after hour, chatting, smoking, eating poee-poee, or busily engaged in
sleeping for the good of their constitutions.

mehevi acted as supreme lord over the place, spending the greater
portion of his time there: and often when, at particular hours of the
day, it was deserted by nearly every one else except the verd-antique
looking centenarians, who were fixtures in the building, the chief
himself was sure to be found enjoying his ‘otium cum dignitate’--upon
the luxurious mats which covered the floor. whenever i made my
appearance he invariably rose, and like a gentleman doing the honours of

 to repose myself wherever i pleased, and calling
out ‘tamaree!’ (boy), a little fellow would appear, and then retiring
for an instant, return with some savoury mess, from which the chief
would press me to regale myself. to tell the truth, mehevi was indebted
to the excellence of his viands for the honour of my repeated visits--a
matter which cannot appear singular, when it is borne in mind that
bachelors, all the world over, are famous for serving up unexceptionable
repasts.

one day, on drawing near to the ti, i observed that extensive
preparations were going forward, plainly betokening some approaching
festival. some of the symptoms reminded me of the stir produced among
the scullions of a large hotel, where a grand jubilee dinner is

carried by two able-bodied men, a whole
swarm gather about it, and, after a vast deal of palavering, lift it
up among them, every one struggling to get hold of it, and bear it off
yelling and panting as if accomplishing some mighty achievement. seeing
them on these occasions, one is reminded of an infinity of black ants
clustering about and dragging away to some hole the leg of a deceased
fly.

having for some time attentively observed these demonstrations of good
cheer, i entered the ti, where mehevi sat complacently looking out upon
the busy scene, and occasionally issuing his orders. the chief appeared
to be in an extraordinary flow of spirits and gave me to understand that
on the morrow there would be grand doings in the groves generally, and
at the ti in particular; and urged me by no means to absent myself. in
commemoration of what event, however, or in honour of what
distinguished personage, the feast was to be given, altogether passed my
comprehension. mehevi sought to enlighten my i

change in my garb seemed to
transport them with delight, and clustering about me on all sides, they
accompanied me towards the ti. when however we drew near it these joyous
nymphs paused in their career, and parting on either side, permitted me
to pass on to the now densely thronged building.

so soon as i mounted to the pi-pi i saw at a glance that the revels were
fairly under way.

what lavish plenty reigned around?--warwick feasting his retainers with
beef and ale, was a niggard to the noble mehevi!--all along the piazza
of the ti were arranged elaborately carved canoe-shaped vessels, some
twenty feet in length, tied with newly made poee-poee, and sheltered
from the sun by the broad leaves of the banana. at intervals were heaps
of green bread-fruit, raised in pyramidical stacks, resembling the
regular piles of heavy shot to be seen in the yard of an arsenal.
inserted into the interstices of the huge stones which formed the pi-pi
were large boughs of trees; hanging from the branches of whi

upon the sandwich islands it has been employed with no small success in
the treatment of scrofulous affections, and in combating the ravages
of a disease for whose frightful inroads the ill-starred inhabitants of
that group are indebted to their foreign benefactors. but the tenants of
the typee valley, as yet exempt from these inflictions, generally employ
the ‘arva’ as a minister to social enjoyment, and a calabash of the
liquid circulates among them as the bottle with us.

mehevi, who was greatly delighted with the change in my costume, gave
me a cordial welcome. he had reserved for me a most delectable mess
of ‘cokoo’, well knowing my partiality for that dish; and had likewise
selected three or four young cocoanuts, several roasted bread-fruit,
and a magnificent bunch of bananas, for my especial comfort and
gratification. these various matters were at once placed before me; but
kory-kory deemed the banquet entirely insufficient for my wants until
he had supplied me

d been nothing more than a jovial
mingling of the tribe; the idols were quite harmless as any other logs
of wood; and the priests were the merriest dogs in the valley.

in fact religious affairs in typee were at a very low ebb: all such
matters sat very lightly upon the thoughtless inhabitants; and, in the
celebration of many of their strange rites, they appeared merely to seek
a sort of childish amusement.

a curious evidence of this was given in a remarkable ceremony in which i
frequently saw mehevi and several other chefs and warriors of note take
part; but never a single female.

among those whom i looked upon as forming the priesthood of the valley,
there was one in particular who often attracted my notice, and whom
i could not help regarding as the head of the order. he was a noble
looking man, in the prime of his life, and of a most benignant aspect.
the authority this man, whose name was kolory, seemed to exercise over
the rest, the episcopal part he took in the feast of calabashes,

xtensive pretensions. in fact, this funny little image was
the ‘crack’ god of the island; lording it over all the wooden lubbers
who looked so grim and dreadful; its name was moa artua*. and it was in
honour of moa artua, and for the entertainment of those who believe in
him, that the curious ceremony i am about to describe was observed.

*the word ‘artua’, although having some other significations, is in
nearly all the polynesian dialects used as the general designation of
the gods.



mehevi and the chieftains of the ti have just risen from their noontide
slumbers. there are no affairs of state to dispose of; and having eaten
two or three breakfasts in the course of the morning, the magnates of
the valley feel no appetite as yet for dinner. how are their leisure
moments to be occupied? they smoke, they chat, and at last one of their
number makes a proposition to the rest, who joyfully acquiescing, he
darts out of the house, leaps from the pi-pi, and disappears in the
grove. soon yo

ings were like those of a parcel of children
playing with dolls and baby houses.

for a youngster scarcely ten inches high, and with so few early
advantages as he doubtless had had, moa artua was certainly a precocious
little fellow if he really said all that was imputed to him; but for
what reason this poor devil of a deity, thus cuffed about, cajoled, and
shut up in a box, was held in greater estimation than the full-grown
and dignified personages of the taboo groves, i cannot divine. and yet
mehevi, and other chiefs of unquestionable veracity--to say nothing of
the primate himself--assured me over and over again that moa artua was
the tutelary deity of typee, and was more to be held in honour than a
whole battalion of the clumsy idols in the hoolah hoolah grounds.

kory-kory--who seemed to have devoted considerable attention to the
study of theology, as he knew the names of all the graven images in the
valley, and often repeated them over to me--likewise entertained some

general information gathered at the festival--personal beauty of
the typees--their superiority over the inhabitants of the other
islands--diversity of complexion--a vegetable cosmetic and
ointment--testimony of voyagers to the uncommon beauty of
the marquesans--few evidences of intercourse with civilized
beings--dilapidated musket--primitive simplicity of government--regal
dignity of mehevi

although i had been unable during the late festival to obtain
information on many interesting subjects which had much excited my
curiosity, still that important event had not passed by without adding
materially to my general knowledge of the islanders.

i was especially struck by the physical strength and beauty which
they displayed, by their great superiority in these respects over the
inhabitants of the neighbouring bay of nukuheva, and by the singular
contrasts they presented among themselv

therefore, can be
imagined more singular than the appearance of these nearly naked damsels
immediately after the application of the cosmetic. to look at one of
them you would almost suppose she was some vegetable in an unripe state;
and that, instead of living in the shade for ever, she ought to be
placed out in the sun to ripen.

all the islanders are more or less in the habit of anointing themselves;
the women preferring the ‘aker’ to ‘papa’, and the men using the oil
of the cocoanut. mehevi was remarkable fond of mollifying his entire
cuticle with this ointment. sometimes he might be seen, with his whole
body fairly reeking with the perfumed oil of the nut, looking as if he
had just emerged from a soap-boiler’s vat, or had undergone the process
of dipping in a tallow-chandlery. to this cause perhaps, united to their
frequent bathing and extreme cleanliness, is ascribable, in a great
measure, the marvellous purity and smoothness of skin exhibited by the
natives in general.

of them before me, and throwing it aside with a gesture of disgust,
manifested their contempt for anything that could so soon become
unserviceable.

but the muskets, the powder, and the bullets were held in most
extravagant esteem. the former, from their great age and the
peculiarities they exhibited, were well worthy a place in any
antiquarian’s armoury. i remember in particular one that hung in the
ti, and which mehevi--supposing as a matter of course that i was able to
repair it--had put into my hands for that purpose. it was one of those
clumsy, old-fashioned, english pieces known generally as tower hill
muskets, and, for aught i know, might have been left on the island by
wallace, carteret, cook, or vancouver. the stock was half rotten and
worm-eaten; the lock was as rusty and about as well adapted to its
ostensible purpose as an old door-hinge; the threading of the screws
about the trigger was completely

worn away; while the barrel shook in
the wood. such was the weapon the chief desired me to restore to its
original condition. as i did not possess the accomplishments of a
gunsmith, and was likewise destitute of the necessary tools, i was
reluctantly obliged to signify my inability to perform the task. at this
unexpected communication mehevi regarded me, for a moment, as if he half
suspected i was some inferior sort of white man, who after all did not
know much more than a typee. however, after a most laboured explanation
of the matter, i succeeded in making him understand the extreme
difficulty of the task. scarcely satisfied with my apologies, however,
he marched off with the superannuated musket in something of a huff, as
if he would no longer expose it to the indignity of being manipulated by
such unskilful fingers.

may seem, it is a fact. while at lahainaluna--the residence of this
monstrous jezebel--a humpbacked wretch was pointed out to me, who, some
twenty-five years previously, had had the vertebrae of his backbone very
seriously discomposed by his gentle mistress.

the particular grades of rank existing among the chiefs of typee, i
could not in all cases determine. previous to the feast of calabashes
i had been puzzled what particular station to assign to mehevi. but the
important part he took upon that occasion convinced me that he had no
superior among the inhabitants of the valley. i had invariably noticed a
certain degree of deference paid to him by all with whom i had ever seen
him brought in contact; but when i remembered that my wanderings had
been confined to a limited portion of the valley, and that towards
the sea a number of distinguished chiefs resided, some of whom had
separately visited me at marheyo’s house, and whom, until the festiva

l,
i had never seen in the company of mehevi, i felt disposed to believe
that his rank after all might not be particularly elevated.

the revels, however, had brought together all the warriors whom i had
seen individually and in groups at different times and places. among
them mehevi moved with an easy air of superiority which was not to be
mistaken; and he whom i had only looked at as the hospitable host of the
ti, and one of the military leaders of the tribe, now assumed in my eyes
the dignity of royal station. his striking costume, no less than his
naturally commanding figure, seemed indeed to give him pre-eminence over
the rest. the towering helmet of feathers that he wore raised him
in height above all who surrounded him; and though some others were
similarly adorned,

the length and luxuriance of their plumes were
inferior to his.

mehevi was in fact the greatest of the chiefs--the head of his clan--the
sovereign of the valley; and the simplicity of the social institutions
of the people could not have been more completely proved than by the
fact, that after having been several weeks in the valley, and almost in
daily intercourse with mehevi, i should have remained until the time of
the festival ignorant of his regal character. but a new light had now
broken in upon me. the ti was the palace--and mehevi the king. both the
one and the other of a most simple and patriarchal nature: it must be
allowed, and wholly unattended by the ceremonious pomp which usually
surrounds the purple.

after having made this discovery i could not avoid congratulating myself
that mehevi had from the first taken me as it were under his royal
protection, a

nd that he still continued to entertain for me the warmest
regard, as far at least as i was enabled to judge from appearances. for
the future i determined to pay most assiduous court to him, hoping that
eventually through his kindness i might obtain my liberty.

charged with a variety of eruptive humours, which are developed in
sundry blotches and pimples upon the august face of ‘majesty itself’,
and the angelic countenances of the ‘princes and princesses of the blood
royal’!

now, if the farcical puppet of a chief magistrate in the sandwich
islands be allowed the title of king, why should it be withheld from
the noble savage mehevi, who is a thousand times more worthy of the
appellation? all hail, therefore, mehevi, king of the cannibal valley,
and long life and prosperity to his typeean majesty! may heaven for many
a year preserve him, the uncompromising foe of nukuheva and the french,
if a hostile attitude will secure his lovely domain from the remorseless
inflictions of south sea civilization.

previously to seeing the dancing widows i had little idea that there
were any matrimonial relations subsisting in typee, and i

, who seemed to have a sort of nuptial understanding
with one another; but for all that, i had sometimes observed a
comical-looking old gentleman dressed in a suit of shabby tattooing, who
had the audacity to take various liberties with the lady, and that too
in the very presence of the old warrior her husband, who looked on
as good-naturedly as if nothing was happening. this behaviour, until
subsequent discoveries enlightened me, puzzled me more than anything
else i witnessed in typee.

as for mehevi, i had supposed him a confirmed bachelor, as well as most
of the principal chiefs. at any rate, if they had wives and families,
they ought to have been ashamed of themselves; for sure i am, they never
troubled themselves about any domestic affairs. in truth, mehevi seemed
to be the president of a club of hearty fellows, who kept ‘bachelor’s
hall’ in fine style at the ti. i had no doubt but that they regarded
children as odious incumbrances; and their ideas of domestic felicity

iently shown in the fact, that they allowed no meddlesome
housekeepers to turn topsy-turvy those snug little arrangements they had
made in their comfortable dwelling. i strongly suspected however, that
some of these jolly bachelors were carrying on love intrigues with
the maidens of the tribe; although they did not appear publicly to
acknowledge them. i happened to pop upon mehevi three or four times when
he was romping--in a most undignified manner for a warrior king--with
one of the prettiest little witches in the valley. she lived with an
old woman and a young man, in a house near marheyo’s; and although in
appearance a mere child herself, had a noble boy about a year old, who
bore a marvellous resemblance to mehevi, whom i should certainly have
believed to have been the father, were it not that the little fellow
had no triangle on his face--but on second thoughts,

tattooing is not
hereditary. mehevi, however, was not the only person upon whom the
damsel moonoony smiled--the young fellow of fifteen, who permanently
resided in the home with her, was decidedly in her good graces. i
sometimes beheld both him and the chief making love at the same time. is
it possible, thought i, that the valiant warrior can consent to give
up a corner in the thing he loves? this too was a mystery which, with
others of the same kind, was afterwards satisfactorily explained.

during the second day of the feast of

. indeed they seemed aware of their
being interlopers, looking fairly ashamed, and always trying to hide
themselves in some dark corner. it was plain enough they did not feel at
home in the vale--that they wished themselves well out of it, and back
to the ugly country from which they must have come.

scurvy curs! they were my abhorrence; i should have liked nothing
better than to have been the death of every one of them. in fact, on one
occasion, i intimated the propriety of a canine crusade to mehevi; but
the benevolent king would not consent to it. he heard me very patiently;
but when i had finished, shook his head, and told me in confidence that
they were ‘taboo’.

as for the animal that made the fortune of the ex-lord-mayor
whittington, i shall never forget the day that i was lying in the house
about noon, everybody else being fast asleep; and happening to raise
my eyes, met those of a big black spectral cat, which sat erect in the
doorway, looking at me with its frightful goggling g

hree savages, and fled towards old
marheyo’s house, pursued by the indomitable artist, who ran after me,
implements in hand. kory-kory, however, at last interfered and drew him
off from the chase.

this incident opened my eyes to a new danger; and i now felt convinced
that in some luckless hour i should be disfigured in such a manner as
never more to have the face to return to my countrymen, even should an
opportunity offer.

these apprehensions were greatly increased by the desire which king
mehevi and several of the inferior chiefs now manifested that i should
be tattooed. the pleasure of the king was first signified to me some
three days after my casual encounter with karky the artist. heavens!
what imprecations i showered upon that karky. doubtless he had plotted a
conspiracy against me and my countenance, and would never rest until his
diabolical purpose was accomplished. several times i met him in various
parts of the valley, and, invariably, whenever he descried me, he came
running

ed up my
courage to the sticking point, and declared my willingness to have both
arms tattooed from just above the wrist to the shoulder. his majesty was
greatly pleased at the proposition, and i was congratulating myself with
having thus compromised the matter, when he intimated that as a thing of
course my face was first to undergo the operation. i was fairly driven
to despair; nothing but the utter ruin of my ‘face divine’, as the
poets call it, would, i perceived, satisfy the inexorable mehevi and his
chiefs, or rather, that infernal karky, for he was at the bottom of it
all.

the only consolation afforded me was a choice of patterns: i was at
perfect liberty to have my face spanned by three horizontal bars, after
the fashion of my serving-man’s; or to have as many oblique stripes
slanting across it; or if, like a true courtier, i chose to model my
style on that of royalty, i might wear a sort of freemason badge upon
my countenance in the shape of a mystic triangle. however, i woul

themselves, their fruit, and even the shadows they cast upon the ground,
were consecrated by its presence. in the same way a pipe, which the king
had bestowed upon me, was rendered sacred in the eyes of the natives,
none of whom could i ever prevail upon to smoke from it. the bowl was
encircled by a woven band of grass, somewhat resembling those turks’
heads occasionally worked in the handles of our whip-stalks.

a similar badge was once braided about my wrist by the royal hand
of mehevi himself, who, as soon as he had concluded the operation,
pronounced me ‘taboo’. this occurred shortly after toby’s disappearance;
and, were it not that from the first moment i had entered the valley
the natives had treated me with uniform kindness, i should have supposed
that their conduct afterwards was to be ascribed to the fact that i had
received this sacred investiture.

feature: to enumerate them all would be imposs

on any subject, would work themselves up into a sort of
wordy paroxysm, during which all descriptions of rough-sided sounds
were projected from their mouths, with a force and rapidity which was
absolutely astonishing.

      . . . . .  .  .  .

although these savages are remarkably fond of chanting, still they
appear to have no idea whatever of singing, at least as the art is
practised in other nations.

i shall never forget the first time i happened to roar out a stave
in the presence of noble mehevi. it was a stanza from the ‘bavarian
broom-seller’. his typeean majesty, with all his court, gazed upon me in
amazement, as if i had displayed some preternatural faculty which heaven
had denied to them. the king was delighted with the verse; but the
chorus fairly transported him. at his solicitation i sang it again and
again, and nothing could be more ludicrous than his vain attempts to
catch the air and the words. the royal savage seemed to think that by
screwing all the features of his fac

e into the end of his nose he
might possibly succeed in the undertaking, but it failed to answer the
purpose; and in the end he gave it up, and consoled himself by listening
to my repetition of the sounds fifty times over.

previous to mehevi’s making the discovery, i had never been aware that
there was anything of the nightingale about me; but i was now promoted
to the place of court-minstrel, in which capacity i was afterwards
perpetually called upon to officiate.

over the stops. this is a favourite recreation with the females and one
in which fayaway greatly excelled. awkward as such an instrument may
appear, it was, in fayaway’s delicate little hands, one of the most
graceful i have ever seen. a young lady, in the act of tormenting a
guitar strung about her neck by a couple of yards of blue ribbon, is not
half so engaging.

      . . . . .  .  .  .

singing was not the only means i possessed of diverting the royal mehevi
and his easy-going subject. nothing afforded them more pleasure than to
see me go through the attitude of pugilistic encounter. as not one of
the natives had soul enough in him to stand up like a man, and allow me
to hammer away at him, for my own personal gratification and that of
the king, i was necessitated to fight with an imaginary enemy, whom i
invariably made to knock under to my superior prowess. sometimes when

avages, and, following him up, i rushed among them dealing my
blows right and left, they would disperse in all directions much to the
enjoyment of mehevi, the chiefs, and themselves.

the noble art of self-defence appeared to be regarded by them as the
peculiar gift of the white man; and i make little doubt that they
supposed armies of europeans were drawn up provided with nothing else
but bony fists and stout hearts, with which they set to in column, and
pummelled one another at the word of command.

the solicitations of some of the natives to subject myself to the odious
operation of tattooing. their importunities drove me half wild, for i
felt how easily they might work their will upon me regarding this or
anything else which they took into their heads. still, however, the
behaviour of the islanders towards me was as kind as ever. fayaway was
quite as engaging; kory-kory as devoted; and mehevi the king just as
gracious and condescending as before. but i had now been three months in
their valley, as nearly as i could estimate; i had grown familiar with
the narrow limits to which my wandering had been confined; and i began
bitterly to feel the state of captivity in which i was held. there
was no one with whom i could freely converse; no one to whom i could
communicate my thoughts; no one who could sympathize with my sufferings.

around him with wild cheers sought to encourage him. the other three men
were marked about the arms and breasts with several slight wounds, which
they somewhat ostentatiously displayed.

these four individuals, having been the most active in the late
encounter, claimed the honour of bearing the bodies of their slain
enemies to the ti. such was the conclusion i drew from my own
observations, and, as far as i could understand, from the explanation
which kory-kory gave me.

the royal mehevi walked by the side of these heroes. he carried in one
hand a musket, from the barrel of which was suspended a small canvas
pouch of powder, and in the other he grasped a short javelin, which he
held before him and regarded with fierce exultation. this javelin he had
wrested from a celebrated champion of the happars, who had ignominiously
fled, and was pursued by his foes beyond the summit of the mountain.

when within a short distance of the ti, the warrior with the wounded
head, who proved to

a mile, my attendant would exclaim, ‘taboo, taboo!’

at the various houses where we stopped, i found many of the inhabitants
reclining at their ease, or pursuing some light occupation, as if
nothing unusual were going forward; but amongst them all i did not
perceive a single chief or warrior. when i asked several of the people
why they were not at the ‘hoolah hoolah’ (the feast), their uniformly
answered the question in a manner which implied that it was not intended
for them, but for mehevi, narmonee, mow-mow, kolor, womonoo, kalow,
running over, in their desire to make me comprehend their meaning, the
names of all the principal chiefs.

everything, in short, strengthened my suspicions with regard to the
nature of the festival they were now celebrating; and which amounted
almost to a certainty. while in nukuheva i had frequently been informed
that the whole tribe were never present at these cannibal banquets, but
the chiefs and priests only; and everything i now observed agreed wi

ken place there, i
proposed to kory-kory to walk there. to this proposition he replied
by pointing with his finger to the newly risen sun, and then up to the
zenith, intimating that our visit must be deferred until noon. shortly
after that hour we accordingly proceeded to the taboo groves, and as
soon as we entered their precincts, i looked fearfully round in, quest
of some memorial of the scene which had so lately been acted there; but
everything appeared as usual. on reaching the ti, we found mehevi and a
few chiefs reclining on the mats, who gave me as friendly a reception as
ever. no allusions of any kind were made by them to the recent events;
and i refrained, for obvious reasons, from referring to them myself.

after staying a short time i took my leave. in passing along the piazza,
previously to descending from the pi-pi, i observed a curiously carved
vessel of wood, of considerable size, with a cover placed over it, of
the same material, and which resembled in shape a small canoe. it

he ti on the back of kory-kory; and
surrounded by the excited savages.

all that i could comprehend of the particulars which mow-mow rehearsed
to his audience as we proceeded, was that my long-lost companion had
arrived in a boat which had just entered the bay. these tidings made
me most anxious to be carried at once to the sea, lest some untoward
circumstance should prevent our meeting; but to this they would not
consent, and continued their course towards the royal abode. as we
approached it, mehevi and several chiefs showed themselves from the
piazza, and called upon us loudly to come to them.

as soon as we had approached, i endeavoured to make them understand that
i was going down to the sea to meet toby. to this the king objected, and
motioned kory-kory to bring me into the house. it was in vain to resist;
and in a few moments i found myself within the ti, surrounded by a noisy
group engaged in discussing the recent intelligence. toby’s name was
frequently repeated, coupled with viol

ent exclamations of astonishment.
it seemed as if they yet remained in doubt with regard to the fact of
his arrival, at at every fresh report that was brought from the shore
they betrayed the liveliest emotions.

almost frenzied at being held in this state of suspense, i passionately
besought mehevi to permit me to proceed. whether my companion had
arrived or not, i felt a presentiment that my own fate was about to be
decided. again and again i renewed my petition to mehevi. he regarded me
with a fixed and serious eye, but at length yielding to my importunity,
reluctantly granted my request.

accompanied by some fifty of the natives, i now rapidly continued my
journey; every few moments being transferred from the back of one
to another, and urging my bearer forward all the while with earnest
entreaties. as i thus hurried forward, no doubt as to the truth of the
information i had received ever crossed my mind.

i was alive only to the one overwhelming idea, that a
