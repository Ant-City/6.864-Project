s, but she was relieved to see that edward
appeared to be having a good time with several amiable girls. and that
was the end of edward--for the spanish dancer of passionate appearance
wanted one night of him for his beaux yeux. he took her into the dark
gardens and, remembering suddenly the girl of the kilsyte case, he
kissed her. he kissed her passionately, violently, with a sudden
explosion of the passion that had been bridled all his life--for
leonora was cold, or at any rate, well behaved. la dolciquita liked this
reversion, and he passed the night in her bed.

when the palpitating creature was at last asleep in his arms he
discovered that he was madly, was passionately, was overwhelmingly in
love with her. it was a passion that had arisen like fire in dry corn.
he could think of nothing else; he could live for nothing else. but la
dolciquita was a reasonable creature without an ounce of passion in
her. she wanted a certain satisfaction of her appetites and edward had
appealed to her the night

 his estate. that was how he
figured it out.

she shrugged the same shoulder with the same gesture and held out her
left hand with the elbow at her side:

"enfin, mon ami," she said, "put in this hand the price of that tiara at
forli's or..." and she turned her back on him.

edward went mad; his world stood on its head; the palms in front of the
blue sea danced grotesque dances. you see, he believed in the virtue,
tenderness and moral support of women. he wanted more than anything to
argue with la dolciquita; to retire with her to an island and point out
to her the damnation of her point of view and how salvation can only
be found in true love and the feudal system. she had once been his
mistress, he reflected, and by all the moral laws she ought to have gone
on being his mistress or at the very least his sympathetic confidante.
but her rooms were closed to him; she did not appear in the hotel.

pened. he spent a week of
madness; he hungered; his eyes sank in; he shuddered at leonora's touch.
i dare say that nine-tenths of what he took to be his passion for
la dolciquita was really discomfort at the thought that he had been
unfaithful to leonora. he felt uncommonly bad, that is to say--oh,
unbearably bad, and he took it all to be love. poor devil, he was
incredibly naïve. he drank like a fish after leonora was in bed and he
spread himself over the tables, and this went on for about a fortnight.
heaven knows what would have happened; he would have thrown away every
penny that he possessed.

on the night after he had lost about forty thousand pounds and whilst

he whole hotel was whispering about it, la dolciquita walked composedly
into his bedroom. he was too drunk to recognize her, and she sat in his
arm-chair, knitting and holding smelling salts to her nose--for he was
pretty far gone with alcoholic poisoning--and, as soon as he was able to
understand her, she said:

"look here, mon ami, do not go to the tables again. take a good sleep
now and come and see me this afternoon."

he slept till the lunch-hour. by that time leonora had heard the news.

with the ashburnhams.
she had argued it out that there must be a woman of the harpy variety
connected with edward's incredible behaviour and mien; and she advised
leonora to go straight off to town--which might have the effect of
bringing edward to his senses--and to consult her solicitor and her
spiritual adviser. she had better go that very morning; it was no good
arguing with a man in edward's condition.

edward, indeed, did not know that she had gone. as soon as he awoke he
went straight to la dolciquita's room and she stood him his lunch in her
own apartments. he fell on her neck and wept, and she put up with it for
a time. she was quite a good-natured woman. and, when she had calmed
him down with eau de mélisse, she said: "look here, my friend, how much
money have you left? five thousand dollars? ten?" for the rumour went
that edward had lost two kings' ransoms a night for fourteen nights and
she imagined that he must be near the end of his resources.

s the tables. i will go with you to antibes for a week for that sum."

edward grunted: "five." she tried to get seven thousand five hundred;
but he stuck to his five thousand and the hotel expenses at antibes. the
sedative carried him just as far as that and then he collapsed again. he
had to leave for antibes at three; he could not do without it. he left a
note for leonora saying that he had gone off for a week with the clinton
morleys, yachting.

he did not enjoy himself very much at antibes. la dolciquita could
talk of nothing with any enthusiasm except money, and she tired
him unceasingly, during every waking hour, for presents of the most
expensive description. and, at the end of a week, she just quietly
kicked him out. he hung about in antibes for three days. he was cured
of the idea that he had any duties towards la dolciquita--feudal or
otherwise. but his sentimentalism required of him an attitude of byronic
gloom--as if his court had gone into half-mourning. then his appetite

with words something like: "we're on the verge
of ruin. do you intend to let me pull things together? if not i shall
retire to hendon on my jointure." (hendon represented a convent to
which she occasionally went for what is called a "retreat" in catholic
circles.) and poor dear edward knew nothing--absolutely nothing. he did
not know how much money he had, as he put it, "blued" at the tables. it
might have been a quarter of a million for all he remembered. he did not
know whether she knew about la dolciquita or whether she imagined that
he had gone off yachting or had stayed at monte carlo. he was just dumb
and he just wanted to get into a hole and not have to talk. leonora did
not make him talk and she said nothing herself.

i do not know much about english legal procedure--i cannot, i mean, give
technical details of how they tied him up. but i know that, two days
later, without her having said more than i have reported to you, leonora

ain behind and die. and
then, that had come out.

the punkah swished in the darkened room; leonora lay exhausted and
motionless in her cane lounge; neither of them stirred. they were both
at that time very ill in indefinite ways.

and then leonora said:

"yes. i promised it to charlie maidan this afternoon. i have offered to
pay her ex's myself."

edward just saved himself from saying: "good god!" you see, he had not
the least idea of what leonora knew--about maisie, about mrs basil, even
about la dolciquita. it was a pretty enigmatic situation for him. it
struck him that leonora must be intending to manage his loves as she
managed his money affairs and it made her more hateful to him--and more
worthy of respect.

leonora, at any rate, had managed his money to some purpose. she had
spoken to him, a week before, for the first time in several years--about
money. she had made twenty-two thousand pounds out of the branshaw
land and seven by the letting of branshaw furnished. by fortunate
investments--i

nt, changed very frequently her point of view. she had been
drilled--in her tradition, in her upbringing--to keep her mouth shut.
but there were times, she said, when she was so near yielding to the
temptation of speaking that afterwards she shuddered to think of those
times. you must postulate that what she desired above all things was
to keep a shut mouth to the world; to edward and to the women that he
loved. if she spoke she would despise herself.

from the moment of his unfaithfulness with la dolciquita she never acted
the part of wife to edward. it was not that she intended to keep herself
from him as a principle, for ever. her spiritual advisers, i believe,
forbade that. but she stipulated that he must, in some way, perhaps
symbolical, come back to her. she was not very clear as to what she
meant; probably she did not know herself. or perhaps she did.

there were moments when he seemed to be coming back to her; there were
moments when she was within a hair of yielding to her physical passion

ing more. well, he was a sentimentalist.

and the moment that she heard that, leonora determined that the girl
should not go five thousand miles away and that she should not continue
to love edward. the way she worked it was this:

she continued to tell the girl that she must belong to edward; she was
going to get a divorce; she was going to get a dissolution of marriage
from rome. but she considered it to be her duty to warn the girl of the
sort of monster that edward was. she told the girl of la dolciquita, of
mrs basil, of maisie maidan, of florence. she spoke of the agonies
that she had endured during her life with the man, who was violent,
overbearing, vain, drunken, arrogant, and monstrously a prey to his
sexual necessities. and, at hearing of the miseries her aunt had
suffered--for leonora once more had the aspect of an aunt to the
girl--with the swift cruelty of youth and, with the swift solidarity
that attaches woman to woman, the girl made her resolves. her aunt said
incessantly: "you mus
