The Three Witches
Throughout the play, the witches--referred to as the "weird
sisters" by many of the characters--lurk like dark thoughts and unconscious
temptations to evil. In part, the mischief they cause stems from
their supernatural powers, but mainly it is the result of their understanding
of the weaknesses of their specific interlocutors--they play upon
Macbeth's ambition like puppeteers.
The witches' beards, bizarre potions, and rhymed speech
make them seem slightly ridiculous, like caricatures of the supernatural. Shakespeare
has them speak in rhyming couplets throughout (their most famous
line is probably "Double, double, toil and trouble, / Fire burn
and cauldron bubble" in 4.1.10-11),
which separates them from the other characters, who mostly speak
in blank verse. The witches' words seem almost comical,
like malevolent nursery rhymes. Despite the absurdity of their "eye
of newt and toe of frog" recipes, however, they are clearly the
most dangerous characters in the play, being both tremendously powerful
and utterly wicked (4.1.14).

The audience is left to ask whether the witches are independent agents
toying with human lives, or agents of fate, whose prophecies are
only reports of the inevitable. The witches bear a striking and obviously
intentional resemblance to the Fates, female characters in both
Norse and Greek mythology who weave the fabric of human lives and
then cut the threads to end them. Some of their prophecies seem
self-fulfilling. For example, it is doubtful that Macbeth would have
murdered his king without the push given by the witches' predictions.
In other cases, though, their prophecies are just remarkably accurate
readings of the future--it is hard to see Birnam Wood coming to Dunsinane
as being self-fulfilling in any way. The play offers no easy answers.
Instead, Shakespeare keeps the witches well outside the limits of
human comprehension. They embody an unreasoning, instinctive evil.
