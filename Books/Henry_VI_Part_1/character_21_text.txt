  talbot. my gracious prince, and honourable peers,
    hearing of your arrival in this realm,
    i have awhile given truce unto my wars
    to do my duty to my sovereign;
    in sign whereof, this arm that hath reclaim'd
    to your obedience fifty fortresses,
    twelve cities, and seven walled towns of strength,
    beside five hundred prisoners of esteem,
    lets fall his sword before your highness' feet,

 how my father said
    a stouter champion never handled sword.
    long since we were resolved of your truth,
    your faithful service, and your toil in war;
    yet never have you tasted our reward,
    or been reguerdon'd with so much as thanks,
    because till now we never saw your face.
    therefore stand up; and for these good deserts
    we here create you earl of shrewsbury;
    and in our coronation take your place.
              sennet. flourish. exeunt all but vernon and basset
  vernon. now, sir, to you, that were so hot at sea,
    disgracing of these colours that i wear
    in honour of my noble lord of york
    dar'st thou maintain the former words thou spak'st?
  basset. yes, sir; as well as you dare patronage
    the envious barking of your saucy tongue
    against my lord the duke of somerset.
  vernon. sirrah, thy lord i honour as he is.
  basset. why, what is he? as good a man as york!
  vernon. hark ye: not so. in witness, take ye that.

  basset. villain, thou knowest the law of arms is such
    that whoso draws a sword 'tis present death,
    or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood.
    but i'll unto his majesty and crave
    i may have liberty to venge this wrong;
    when thou shalt see i'll meet thee to thy cost.
  vernon. well, miscreant, i'll be there as soon as you;
    and, after, meet you sooner than you would.           exeunt

    how say you, my lord, are you not content?
  talbot. content, my liege! yes; but that i am prevented,
    i should have begg'd i might have been employ'd.

    let him perceive how ill we brook his treason.

  king henry. be patient, lords, and give them leave to speak.
    say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim,
    and wherefore crave you combat, or with whom?
  vernon. with him, my lord; for he hath done me wrong.

 henry. what is that wrong whereof you both
    complain? first let me know, and then i'll answer you.
  basset. crossing the sea from england into france,
    this fellow here, with envious carping tongue,
    upbraided me about the rose i wear,
    saying the sanguine colour of the leaves
    did represent my master's blushing cheeks
    when stubbornly he did repugn the truth
    about a certain question in the law
    argu'd betwixt the duke of york and him;

    men, when for so slight and frivolous a cause
    such factious emulations shall arise!
    good cousins both, of york and somerset,
    quiet yourselves, i pray, and be at peace.
  york. let this dissension first be tried by fight,
    and then your highness shall command a peace.
  somerset. the quarrel toucheth none but us alone;
    betwixt ourselves let us decide it then.
  york. there is my pledge; accept it, somerset.
  vernon. nay, let it rest where it began at first.
  basset. confirm it so, mine honourable lord.
  gloucester. confirm it so? confounded be your strife;
    and perish ye, with your audacious prate!
    presumptuous vassals, are you not asham'd
    with this immodest clamorous outrage
    to trouble and disturb the king and us?
    and you, my lords--methinks you do not well
    to bear with their perverse objections,
    much less to take occasion from their mouths
    to raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves.
