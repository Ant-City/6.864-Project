[CHARACTER] - 
                	a
nonwhite (arab or black) slave boy only briefly introduced during
the period of crusoe's enslavement in sallee. when crusoe escapes
with two other slaves in a boat, he forces one to swim to shore
but keeps [CHARACTER] on board, showing a certain trust toward the boy.
[CHARACTER] never betrays that trust. nevertheless, when the portuguese
captain eventually picks them up, crusoe sells [CHARACTER] to the captain.
[CHARACTER]'s sale shows us the racist double standards sometimes apparent
in crusoe's behavior.
