e gossiping reminiscences of the great
pillar, still ringing with the tattle of the patru.

it is not much. let us return to the veritable grand hall of the
veritable old palace. the two extremities of this gigantic parallelogram
were occupied, the one by the famous marble table, so long, so broad,
and so thick that, as the ancient land rolls--in a style that would have
given gargantua an appetite--say, “such a slice of marble as was never
beheld in the world”; the other by the chapel where louis xi. had
himself sculptured on his knees before the virgin, and whither he caused
to be brought, without heeding the two gaps thus made in the row of
royal statues, the statues of charlemagne and of saint louis, two saints
whom he supposed to be great in favor in heaven, as kings of france.
this chapel, quite new, having been built only six years, was entirely
in that charming taste of delicate architecture, of marvellous
sculpture, of fine and deep chasing, which marks with us the end of

the cardinal halted for a moment on the threshold of the estrade. while
he was sending a rather indifferent glance around the audience, the
tumult redoubled. each person wished to get a better view of him.
each man vied with the other in thrusting his head over his neighbor’s
shoulder.

he was, in fact, an exalted personage, the sight of whom was well worth
any other comedy. charles, cardinal de bourbon, archbishop and comte of
lyon, primate of the gauls, was allied both to louis xi., through his
brother, pierre, seigneur de beaujeu, who had married the king’s eldest
daughter, and to charles the bold through his mother, agnes of burgundy.
now, the dominating trait, the peculiar and distinctive trait of the
character of the primate of the gauls, was the spirit of the courtier,
and devotion to the powers that be. the reader can form an idea of the
numberless embarrassments which this double relationship had caused him,
and of all the temporal reefs among which his spiritua

bishops and abbés invaded the estrade in his train, not without causing
redoubled tumult and curiosity among the audience. each man vied with
his neighbor in pointing them out and naming them, in seeing who should
recognize at least one of them: this one, the bishop of marseilles
(alaudet, if my memory serves me right);--this one, the primicier of
saint-denis;--this one, robert de lespinasse, abbé of saint-germain des
prés, that libertine brother of a mistress of louis xi.; all with many
errors and absurdities. as for the scholars, they swore. this was their
day, their feast of fools, their saturnalia, the annual orgy of the
corporation of law clerks and of the school. there was no turpitude
which was not sacred on that day. and then there were gay gossips in the

long the good understanding which had been patched up between the
duke of austria and the king of france would last; nor how the king of
england would take this disdain of his daughter. all that troubled him
but little; and he gave a warm reception every evening to the wine of
the royal vintage of chaillot, without a suspicion that several flasks
of that same wine (somewhat revised and corrected, it is true, by doctor
coictier), cordially offered to edward iv. by louis xi., would, some
fine morning, rid louis xi. of edward iv. “the much honored embassy of
monsieur the duke of austria,” brought the cardinal none of these cares,
but it troubled him in another direction. it was, in fact, somewhat
hard, and we have already hinted at it on the second page of this
book,--for him, charles de bourbon, to be obliged to feast and receive
cordially no one knows what bourgeois;--for him, a cardinal, to receive
aldermen;--for him, a frenchman, and a jolly companion, to r

ow, and whose name,
nevertheless, was only, “guillaume rym, counsellor and pensioner of the
city of ghent.”

few persons were then aware who guillaume rym was. a rare genius who
in a time of revolution would have made a brilliant appearance on the
surface of events, but who in the fifteenth century was reduced to
cavernous intrigues, and to “living in mines,” as the duc de saint-simon
expresses it. nevertheless, he was appreciated by the “miner” of europe;
he plotted familiarly with louis xi., and often lent a hand to the
king’s secret jobs. all which things were quite unknown to that throng,
who were amazed at the cardinal’s politeness to that frail figure of a
flemish bailiff.




chapter iv. master jacques coppenole.



while the pensioner of ghent and his eminence were exchanging very low
bows and a few words in voices still lower, a man of lofty stature, with
a large face and broad shoulders, presented himself, in order to enter
abreast with guillaume rym; one would have p

had touched in all these plebeian souls that latent sentiment of dignity
still vague and indistinct in the fifteenth century.

this hosier was an equal, who had just held his own before monsieur the
cardinal. a very sweet reflection to poor fellows habituated to respect
and obedience towards the underlings of the sergeants of the bailiff of
sainte-geneviève, the cardinal’s train-bearer.

coppenole proudly saluted his eminence, who returned the salute of the
all-powerful bourgeois feared by louis xi. then, while guillaume rym, a
“sage and malicious man,” as philippe de comines puts it, watched them
both with a smile of raillery and superiority, each sought his place,
the cardinal quite abashed and troubled, coppenole tranquil and haughty,
and thinking, no doubt, that his title of hosier was as good as any
other, after all, and that marie of burgundy, mother to that marguerite
whom coppenole was to-day bestowing in marriage, would have been less
afraid of the cardinal than of the hosier

under the pretext of business and vespers,
without the crowd which his arrival had so deeply stirred being in the
least moved by his departure. guillaume rym was the only one who noticed
his eminence’s discomfiture. the attention of the populace, like the
sun, pursued its revolution; having set out from one end of the hall,
and halted for a space in the middle, it had now reached the other end.
the marble table, the brocaded gallery had each had their day; it was
now the turn of the chapel of louis xi. henceforth, the field was open
to all folly. there was no one there now, but the flemings and the
rabble.

the grimaces began. the first face which appeared at the aperture,
with eyelids turned up to the reds, a mouth open like a maw, and a
brow wrinkled like our hussar boots of the empire, evoked such an
inextinguishable peal of laughter that homer would have taken all these
louts for gods. nevertheless, the grand hall was anything but olympus,

the paris of three hundred and fifty years ago--the paris of the
fifteenth century--was already a gigantic city. we parisians generally
make a mistake as to the ground which we think that we have gained,
since paris has not increased much over one-third since the time of
louis xi. it has certainly lost more in beauty than it has gained in
size.

paris had its birth, as the reader knows, in that old island of the city
which has the form of a cradle. the strand of that island was its
first boundary wall, the seine its first moat. paris remained for many
centuries in its island state, with two bridges, one on the north, the
other on the south; and two bridge heads, which were at the same time
its gates and its fortresses,--the grand-châtelet on the right bank,

ury itself deeper and deeper in the old city, so thick
had the new city already become outside of it. thus, beginning with the
fifteenth century, where our story finds us, paris had already outgrown
the three concentric circles of walls which, from the time of julian the
apostate, existed, so to speak, in germ in the grand-châtelet and the
petit-châtelet. the mighty city had cracked, in succession, its four
enclosures of walls, like a child grown too large for his garments of
last year. under louis xi., this sea of houses was seen to be pierced
at intervals by several groups of ruined towers, from the ancient wall,
like the summits of hills in an inundation,--like archipelagos of the
old paris submerged beneath the new. since that time paris has undergone
yet another transformation, unfortunately for our eyes; but it has
passed only one more wall, that of louis xv., that miserable wall of
mud and spittle, worthy of the king who built it, worthy of the poet who
sung it,--

beneath them, at the foot of the formidable edifice, behold the porte

beyond the tournelles, as far as the wall of charles v., spread out,
with rich compartments of verdure and of flowers, a velvet carpet of
cultivated land and royal parks, in the midst of which one recognized,
by its labyrinth of trees and alleys, the famous daedalus garden which
louis xi. had given to coictier. the doctor’s observatory rose above the
labyrinth like a great isolated column, with a tiny house for a capital.
terrible astrologies took place in that laboratory.

there to-day is the place royale.

as we have just said, the quarter of the palace, of which we have just
endeavored to give the reader some idea by indicating only the chief
points, filled the angle which charles v.’s wall made with the seine on
the east. the centre of the town was occupied by a pile of

conflans to ville-l’evêque. on the horizon, a border of hills arranged
in a circle like the rim of the basin. finally, far away to the east,
vincennes, and its seven quadrangular towers to the south, bicêtre and
its pointed turrets; to the north, saint-denis and its spire; to the
west, saint cloud and its donjon keep. such was the paris which the
ravens, who lived in 1482, beheld from the summits of the towers of
notre-dame.

nevertheless, voltaire said of this city, that “before louis xiv.,
it possessed but four fine monuments”: the dome of the sorbonne, the
val-de-grâce, the modern louvre, and i know not what the fourth was--the
luxembourg, perhaps. fortunately, voltaire was the author of “candide”
 in spite of this, and in spite of this, he is, among all the men who
have followed each other in the long series of humanity, the one who has
best possessed the diabolical laugh. moreover, this proves that one can
be a fine genius, and yet understand nothing of an art to whi

 of the old louvre was begun.

after that, the great city became more disfigured every day. gothic
paris, beneath which roman paris was effaced, was effaced in its turn;
but can any one say what paris has replaced it?

there is the paris of catherine de medicis at the tuileries;*--the
paris of henri ii., at the hôtel de ville, two edifices still in fine
taste;--the paris of henri iv., at the place royale: façades of brick
with stone corners, and slated roofs, tri-colored houses;--the paris of
louis xiii., at the val-de-grace: a crushed and squat architecture, with
vaults like basket-handles, and something indescribably pot-bellied in
the column, and thickset in the dome;--the paris of louis xiv., in
the invalides: grand, rich, gilded, cold;--the paris of louis xv., in
saint-sulpice: volutes, knots of ribbon, clouds, vermicelli and chiccory
leaves, all in stone;--the paris of louis xvi., in the pantheon: saint

now, in 1482, quasimodo had grown up. he had become a few years
previously the bellringer of notre-dame, thanks to his father by
adoption, claude frollo,--who had become archdeacon of josas, thanks
to his suzerain, messire louis de beaumont,--who had become bishop of
paris, at the death of guillaume chartier in 1472, thanks to his patron,
olivier le daim, barber to louis xi., king by the grace of god.

so quasimodo was the ringer of the chimes of notre-dame.

in the course of time there had been formed a certain peculiarly
intimate bond which united the ringer to the church. separated forever
from the world, by the double fatality of his unknown birth and his
natural deformity, imprisoned from his infancy in that impassable double
circle, the poor wretch had grown used to seeing nothing in this world
beyond the religious walls which had received him under their sh

a side glance at his companion.

“think you so, gossip coictier,” said the latter.

these words, uttered in a tone of surprise and reproach, drew upon this
unknown personage the attention of the archdeacon which, to tell the
truth, had not been diverted from him a single moment since the stranger
had set foot across the threshold of his cell. it had even required all
the thousand reasons which he had for handling tenderly doctor jacques
coictier, the all-powerful physician of king louis xi., to induce him
to receive the latter thus accompanied. hence, there was nothing very
cordial in his manner when jacques coictier said to him,--

“by the way, dom claude, i bring you a colleague who has desired to see
you on account of your reputation.”

“monsieur belongs to science?” asked the archdeacon, fixing his piercing
eye upon coictier’s companion. he found beneath the brows of the
stranger a glance no less piercing or less distrustful than his own.

the archdeacon returned to his chamber dumbfounded, comprehending
at last who gossip tourangeau was, and recalling that passage of the
register of sainte-martin, of tours:--_abbas beati martini, scilicet rex
franciae, est canonicus de consuetudine et habet parvam proebendam quam
habet sanctus venantius, et debet sedere in sede thesaurarii_.

it is asserted that after that epoch the archdeacon had frequent
conferences with louis xi., when his majesty came to paris, and that
dom claude’s influence quite overshadowed that of olivier le daim and
jacques coictier, who, as was his habit, rudely took the king to task on
that account.




chapter ii. this will kill that.



our lady readers will pardon us if we pause for a moment to seek what
could have been the thought concealed beneath those enigmatic words of
the archdeacon: “this will kill that. the book will kill the edifice.”

to our mind, this thought had two faces.

the fine lines of art give way to the cold and inexorable lines of
geometry. an edifice is no longer an edifice; it is a polyhedron.
meanwhile, architecture is tormented in her struggles to conceal this
nudity. look at the greek pediment inscribed upon the roman pediment,
and vice versa. it is still the pantheon on the parthenon: saint-peter’s
of rome. here are the brick houses of henri iv., with their stone
corners; the place royale, the place dauphine. here are the churches
of louis xiii., heavy, squat, thickset, crowded together, loaded with a
dome like a hump. here is the mazarin architecture, the wretched italian
pasticcio of the four nations. here are the palaces of louis xiv., long
barracks for courtiers, stiff, cold, tiresome. here, finally, is louis
xv., with chiccory leaves and vermicelli, and all the warts, and all
the fungi, which disfigure that decrepit, toothless, and coquettish old
architecture. from françois ii. to louis xv., the evil has increased in

s. that capital of forces which human thought had been
expending in edifices, it henceforth expends in books. thus, from the
sixteenth century onward, the press, raised to the level of decaying
architecture, contends with it and kills it. in the seventeenth century
it is already sufficiently the sovereign, sufficiently triumphant,
sufficiently established in its victory, to give to the world the feast
of a great literary century. in the eighteenth, having reposed for a
long time at the court of louis xiv., it seizes again the old sword of
luther, puts it into the hand of voltaire, and rushes impetuously to
the attack of that ancient europe, whose architectural expression it has
already killed. at the moment when the eighteenth century comes to
an end, it has destroyed everything. in the nineteenth, it begins to
reconstruct.

now, we ask, which of the three arts has really represented human
thought for the last three centuries? which translates it? which

years since he had received from the king, on november 7, 1465, the

reputed rather a seigneury than an office. _dignitas_, says joannes
loemnoeus, _quæ cum non exigua potestate politiam concernente, atque

‘82 was a gentleman bearing the king’s commission, and whose letters

chancellorship, the mastership passed since robert d’estouteville
had held the provostship of paris. it had been “granted to him for
safekeeping,” as the letters patent said; and certainly he kept it
well. he had clung to it, he had incorporated himself with it, he had
so identified himself with it that he had escaped that fury for change
which possessed louis xi., a tormenting and industrious king, whose
policy it was to maintain the elasticity of his power by frequent
appointments and revocations. more than this; the brave chevalier had
obtained the reversion of the office for his son, and for two years
already, the name of the noble man jacques d’estouteville, equerry, had
figured beside his at the head of the register of the salary list of the

every city during the middle ages, and every city in france down to the
time of louis xii. had its places of asylum. these sanctuaries, in the
midst of the deluge of penal and barbarous jurisdictions which inundated
the city, were a species of islands which rose above the level of human
justice. every criminal who landed there was safe. there were in every
suburb almost as many places of asylum as gallows. it was the abuse of
impunity by the side of the abuse of punishment; two bad things which
strove to correct each other. the palaces of the king, the hotels of

in paris, for example, independently of the hundred and forty-one lords
who laid claim to a manor, there were five and twenty who laid claim to
a manor and to administering justice, from the bishop of paris, who had
five hundred streets, to the prior of notre-dame des champs, who had

chapter v. the retreat in which monsieur louis of france says his
prayers.



the reader has not, perhaps, forgotten that one moment before catching
sight of the nocturnal band of vagabonds, quasimodo, as he inspected
paris from the heights of his bell tower, perceived only one light
burning, which gleamed like a star from a window on the topmost story
of a lofty edifice beside the porte saint-antoine. this edifice was the
bastille. that star was the candle of louis xi. king louis xi. had, in
fact, been two days in paris. he was to take his departure on the next
day but one for his citadel of montilz-les-tours. he made but seldom and
brief appearance in his good city of paris, since there he did not feel
about him enough pitfalls, gibbets, and scotch archers.

he had come, that day, to sleep at the bastille. the great chamber five

ere was a table covered with a cloth with a pattern of birds. on this
table stood an inkhorn spotted with ink, some parchments, several pens,
and a large goblet of chased silver. a little further on was a brazier,
a praying stool in crimson velvet, relieved with small bosses of gold.
finally, at the extreme end of the room, a simple bed of scarlet and
yellow damask, without either tinsel or lace; having only an ordinary
fringe. this bed, famous for having borne the sleep or the sleeplessness
of louis xi., was still to be seen two hundred years ago, at the
house of a councillor of state, where it was seen by old madame pilou,
celebrated in _cyrus_ under the name “arricidie” and of “la morale
vivante”.

such was the chamber which was called “the retreat where monsieur louis
de france says his prayers.”

at the moment when we have introduced the reader into it, this retreat
was very dark. the curfew bell had sounded an hour before; night was
come, and there was only one flickering wax

figures. this, in company with a dirty skull-cap, which hardly allowed a

his head so bent upon his breast, that nothing was to be seen of his
face thus thrown into shadow, except the tip of his nose, upon which
fell a ray of light, and which must have been long. from the thinness of
his wrinkled hand, one divined that he was an old man. it was louis xi.
at some distance behind them, two men dressed in garments of flemish
style were conversing, who were not sufficiently lost in the shadow to
prevent any one who had been present at the performance of gringoire’s
mystery from recognizing in them two of the principal flemish envoys,
guillaume rym, the sagacious pensioner of ghent, and jacques coppenole,
the popular hosier. the reader will remember that these men were mixed
up in the secret politics of louis xi. finally, quite at the end of

pleasant ways. have you seen him, master guillaume? princes must have
these terrific animals; for we kings must have lions for our dogs and
tigers for our cats. the great befits a crown. in the days of the pagans

“‘tis a great deal of iron,” said the king, “to contain the light of a

“the whole amounts to three hundred and seventeen livres, five sols,

“_pasque-dieu_!” exclaimed the king.

at this oath, which was the favorite of louis xi., some one seemed
to awaken in the interior of the cage; the sound of chains was heard,
grating on the floor, and a feeble voice, which seemed to issue from the
tomb was uplifted. “sire! sire! mercy!” the one who spoke thus could not
be seen.

frozen all present, even master olivier himself. the king alone wore
the air of not having heard. at his

 message! what doth our brother the
emperor claim?” and running his eye over the missive and breaking
his reading with interjection: “surely! the germans are so great and
powerful, that it is hardly credible--but let us not forget the old
proverb: ‘the finest county is flanders; the finest duchy, milan; the
finest kingdom, france.’ is it not so, messieurs flemings?”

this time coppenole bowed in company with guillaume rym. the hosier’s
patriotism was tickled.

the last despatch made louis xi. frown.

“what is this?” he said, “complaints and fault finding against our
garrisons in picardy! olivier, write with diligence to m. the marshal
de rouault:--that discipline is relaxed. that the gendarmes of the
unattached troops, the feudal nobles, the free archers, and the swiss
inflict infinite evils on the rustics.--that the military, not content
with what they find in the houses of the rustics, constrain them with
violent blows of cudgel or of lash to go and get wine, spices, and ot

content ourselves with a doublet of cloth at sixteen sols the ell, of
paris.--that messieurs the camp-followers can very well come down
to that, also.--command and ordain.--to monsieur de rouault, our
friend.--good.”

he dictated this letter aloud, in a firm tone, and in jerks. at the
moment when he finished it, the door opened and gave passage to a
new personage, who precipitated himself into the chamber, crying in
affright,--

“sire! sire! there is a sedition of the populace in paris!” louis xi.’s
grave face contracted; but all that was visible of his emotion passed
away like a flash of lightning. he controlled himself and said with
tranquil severity,--

“gossip jacques, you enter very abruptly!”

“sire! sire! there is a revolt!” repeated gossip jacques breathlessly.

the king, who had risen, grasped him roughly by the arm, and said in
his ear, in such a manner as to be heard by him alone, with concentrated
rage and a sidelong glance at the flemings,--

“hold your tongue!

iends the flemings.”

“but sire...”

“speak loud!”

gossip coictier was struck dumb with surprise.

“so,” resumed the king,--“speak sir,--there is a commotion among the
louts in our good city of paris?”

“yes, sire.”

“and which is moving you say, against monsieur the bailiff of the
palais-de-justice?”

“so it appears,” said the gossip, who still stammered, utterly astounded
by the abrupt and inexplicable change which had just taken place in the
king’s thoughts.

louis xi. continued: “where did the watch meet the rabble?”

“marching from the grand truanderie, towards the pont-aux-changeurs. i
met it myself as i was on my way hither to obey your majesty’s commands.
i heard some of them shouting: ‘down with the bailiff of the palace!’”

“and what complaints have they against the bailiff?”

“ah!” said gossip jacques, “because he is their lord.”

“really?”

“yes, sire. they are knaves from the cour-des-miracles. they have been
complai

marvellous, and
we are greatly enraged at it. but we have only a few people about us
to-night. to-morrow morning will be time enough.”

gossip jacques exclaimed, “instantly, sire! there will be time to sack
the bailiwick a score of times, to violate the seignory, to hang the
bailiff. for god’s sake, sire! send before to-morrow morning.”

the king looked him full in the face. “i have told you to-morrow
morning.”

it was one of those looks to which one does not reply. after a silence,
louis xi. raised his voice once more,--

“you should know that, gossip jacques. what was--”

he corrected himself. “what is the bailiff’s feudal jurisdiction?”

“sire, the bailiff of the palace has the rue calendre as far as the rue
de l’herberie, the place saint-michel, and the localities vulgarly known
as the mureaux, situated near the church of notre-dame des champs (here
louis xi. raised the brim of his hat), which hotels number thirteen,
plus the cour des miracles, plus the maladerie,

“i know not,” said he. “they went, i went.”

“were you not going to outrageously attack and pillage your lord, the
bailiff of the palace?”

“i know that they were going to take something from some one. that is
all.”

a soldier pointed out to the king a billhook which he had seized on the
person of the vagabond.

“do you recognize this weapon?” demanded the king.

“yes; ‘tis my billhook; i am a vine-dresser.”

“and do you recognize this man as your companion?” added louis xi.,
pointing to the other prisoner.

“no, i do not know him.”

“that will do,” said the king, making a sign with his finger to the
silent personage who stood motionless beside the door, to whom we have
already called the reader’s attention.

“gossip tristan, here is a man for you.”

tristan l’hermite bowed. he gave an order in a low voice to two archers,
who led away the poor vagabond.

in the meantime, the king had approached the second prisoner, who was
perspiring in great drops

“you split our head!”

tristan l’hermite advanced and pointing to gringoire,--

“sire, can this one be hanged also?”

this was the first word that he had uttered.

“phew!” replied the king, “i see no objection.”

“i see a great many!” said gringoire.

at that moment, our philosopher was greener than an olive. he perceived
from the king’s cold and indifferent mien that there was no other
resource than something very pathetic, and he flung himself at the feet
of louis xi., exclaiming, with gestures of despair:--

“sire! will your majesty deign to hear me. sire! break not in thunder
over so small a thing as myself. god’s great lightning doth not bombard
a lettuce. sire, you are an august and, very puissant monarch; have pity
on a poor man who is honest, and who would find it more difficult to
stir up a revolt than a cake of ice would to give out a spark! very

 knee of his breeches with his finger-nail; then his majesty began
to drink from the goblet of ptisan. but he uttered not a word, and this
silence tortured gringoire. at last the king looked at him. “here is a
terrible bawler!” said, he. then, turning to tristan l’hermite, “bali!
let him go!”

gringoire fell backwards, quite thunderstruck with joy.

“at liberty!” growled tristan “doth not your majesty wish to have him
detained a little while in a cage?”

“gossip,” retorted louis xi., “think you that ‘tis for birds of this
feather that we cause to be made cages at three hundred and sixty-seven
livres, eight sous, three deniers apiece? release him at once,
the wanton (louis xi. was fond of this word which formed, with
_pasque-dieu_, the foundation of his joviality), and put him out with a
buffet.”

“ugh!” cried gringoire, “what a great king is here!”

and for fear of a counter order, he rushed towards the door, which
tristan opened for him with a very bad grac

r majesty had me summoned?”

“oh!” said the king, “i really suffer greatly, my gossip. there is a
hissing in my ear and fiery rakes rack my chest.”

coictier took the king’s hand, and begun to feel of his pulse with a
knowing air.

“look, coppenole,” said rym, in a low voice. “behold him between
coictier and tristan. they are his whole court. a physician for himself,
a headsman for others.”

as he felt the king’s pulse, coictier assumed an air of greater and
greater alarm. louis xi. watched him with some anxiety. coictier grew
visibly more gloomy. the brave man had no other farm than the king’s bad
health. he speculated on it to the best of his ability.

“oh! oh!” he murmured at length, “this is serious indeed.”

“is it not?” said the king, uneasily.

“_pulsus creber, anhelans, crepitans, irregularis_,” continued the
leech.

“_pasque-dieu_!”

“this may carry off its man in less than three days.”

“our lady!” exclaimed the king. “and the rem

he made louis xi. put out his tongue, shook his head, made a grimace,
and in the very midst of these affectations,--

“pardieu, sire,” he suddenly said, “i must tell you that there is
a receivership of the royal prerogatives vacant, and that i have a
nephew.”

“i give the receivership to your nephew, gossip jacques,” replied the
king; “but draw this fire from my breast.”

“since your majesty is so clement,” replied the leech, “you will

never were seen more amorous eyes, more rounded limbs, a nobler air,
or a more gracefully flowing skirt. she is one of the most innocent and
most perfect beauties whom the brush has ever produced.”

“executioner!” grumbled louis xi., “what are you driving at?”

“i must have a roof for these paintings, sire, and, although ‘tis but a
small matter, i have no more money.”

“how much doth your roof cost?”

“why a roof of copper, embellished and gilt, two thousand livres at the
most.”

“ah, assassin!” cried the king, “he never draws out one of my teeth
which is not a diamond.”

“am i to have my roof?” said coictier.

“yes; and go to the devil, but cure me.”

jacques coictier bowed low and said,

“sire, it is a repellent which will save you. we will apply to your
loins the great defensive composed of cerate, armenian bole, white of
egg, oil, and vinegar. you will continue your ptisan and we will answer
for your majesty.”

a burning candle does not attract one gnat alone. master olivier,
perceiving the king to be in a liberal mood, and judging the moment to
be propitious, approached in his turn.

“sire--”

“what is it now?” said louis xi. “sire, your majesty knoweth that simon
radin is dead?”

“well?”

“he was councillor to the king in the matter of the courts of the
treasury.”

“well?”

“sire, his place is vacant.”

as he spoke thus, master olivier’s haughty face quitted its arrogant
expression for a lowly one. it is the only change which ever takes place
in a courtier’s visage. the king looked him well in the face and said in
a dry tone,--“i understand.”

he resumed,

“master olivier, the marshal

these words, uttered with severity, made master olivier’s face revert to
its insolence.

“good!” he muttered, almost aloud, “‘tis easy to see that the king is
ill to-day; he giveth all to the leech.”

louis xi. far from being irritated by this petulant insult, resumed with
some gentleness, “stay, i was forgetting that i made you my ambassador
to madame marie, at ghent. yes, gentlemen,” added the king turning to
the flemings, “this man hath been an ambassador. there, my gossip,” he
pursued, addressing master olivier, “let us not get angry; we are old
friends. ‘tis very late. we have terminated our labors. shave me.”

our readers have not, without doubt, waited until the present moment to

recognize in master olivier that terrible figaro whom providence, the
great maker of dramas, mingled so artistically in the long and bloody
comedy of the reign of louis xi. we will not here undertake to develop
that singular figure. this barber of the king had three names. at court
he was politely called olivier le daim (the deer); among the people
olivier the devil. his real name was olivier le mauvais.

accordingly, olivier le mauvais remained motionless, sulking at the
king, and glancing askance at jacques coictier.

“yes, yes, the physician!” he said between his teeth.

“ah, yes, the physician!” retorted louis xi., with singular good humor;
“the phy

y good people! here you are aiding me at last in tearing down
the rights of lordship!”

then turning towards the flemings: “come, look at this, gentlemen. is it
not a fire which gloweth yonder?”

the two men of ghent drew near.

“a great fire,” said guillaume rym.

“oh!” exclaimed coppenole, whose eyes suddenly flashed, “that reminds me
of the burning of the house of the seigneur d’hymbercourt. there must be
a goodly revolt yonder.”

“you think so, master coppenole?” and louis xi.’s glance was almost as
joyous as that of the hosier. “will it not be difficult to resist?”

“cross of god! sire! your majesty will damage many companies of men of
war thereon.”

“ah! i! ‘tis different,” returned the king. “if i willed.” the hosier
replied hardily,--

“if this revolt be what i suppose, sire, you might will in vain.”

“gossip,” said louis xi., “with the two companies of my unattached
troops and one discharge of a serpentine, short work is made of a

ely.

“let him speak, monsieur rym, my friend,” said the king; “i love this
frankness of speech. my father, charles the seventh, was accustomed
to say that the truth was ailing; i thought her dead, and that she had
found no confessor. master coppenole undeceiveth me.”

then, laying his hand familiarly on coppenole’s shoulder,--

“you were saying, master jacques?”

“i say, sire, that you may possibly be in the right, that the hour of
the people may not yet have come with you.”

louis xi. gazed at him with his penetrating eye,--

“and when will that hour come, master?”

“you will hear it strike.”

“on what clock, if you please?”

coppenole, with his tranquil and rustic countenance, made the king
approach the window.

“listen, sire! there is here a donjon keep, a belfry, cannons,
bourgeois, soldiers; when the belfry shall hum, when the cannons
shall roar, when the donjon shall fall in ruins amid great noise, when
bourgeois and soldiers shall howl and slay each othe

as something on the heart: then people troop up, they shout,
they ring the alarm bell, they arm the louts with what they take from
the soldiers, the market people join in, and they set out. and it will
always be thus, so long as there are lords in the seignories, bourgeois
in the bourgs, and peasants in the country.”

“and against whom do you thus rebel?” inquired the king; “against your
bailiffs? against your lords?”

“sometimes; that depends. against the duke, also, sometimes.”

louis xi. returned and seated himself, saying, with a smile,--

“ah! here they have only got as far as the bailiffs.”

at that instant olivier le daim returned. he was followed by two pages,
who bore the king’s toilet articles; but what struck louis xi. was that
he was also accompanied by the provost of paris and the chevalier of
the watch, who appeared to be in consternation. the spiteful barber
also wore an air of consternation, which was one of contentment beneath,
however. it was he who spoke

violent blow, “‘tis not against the
bailiff of the courts that this popular sedition is directed.”

“against whom, then?”

“against you, sire?’

the aged king rose erect and straight as a young man,--

“explain yourself, olivier! and guard your head well, gossip; for i
swear to you by the cross of saint-lô that, if you lie to us at this
hour, the sword which severed the head of monsieur de luxembourg is not
so notched that it cannot yet sever yours!”

the oath was formidable; louis xi. had only sworn twice in the course of
his life by the cross of saint-lô.

olivier opened his mouth to reply.

“sire--”

“on your knees!” interrupted the king violently. “tristan, have an eye
to this man.”

olivier knelt down and said coldly,--

“sire, a sorceress was condemned to death by your court of parliament.
she took refuge in notre-dame. the people are trying to take her from
thence by main force. monsieur the provost and monsieur the chevalier of

both retired and gained their apartments under the guidance of the
captain of the bastille. coppenole said to guillaume rym,--

“hum! i have had enough of that coughing king! i have seen charles of
burgundy drunk, and he was less malignant than louis xi. when ailing.”

“master jacques,” replied rym, “‘tis because wine renders kings less
cruel than does barley water.”

on emerging from the bastille, gringoire descended the rue saint-antoine
with the swiftness of a runaway horse. on arriving at the baudoyer gate,
he walked straight to the stone cross which rose in the middle of that
place, as though he were able to distinguish in the darkness the figure

made his face resemble the muzzle of a wolf, “two mice in the trap!”

“i suspected as much,” said the soldier.

tristan clapped him on the shoulder,--

“you are a good cat! come!” he added, “where is henriet cousin?”

a man who had neither the garments nor the air of a soldier, stepped
from the ranks. he wore a costume half gray, half brown, flat hair,
leather sleeves, and carried a bundle of ropes in his huge hand. this
man always attended tristan, who always attended louis xi. “friend,”
 said tristan l’hermite, “i presume that this is the sorceress of whom we
are in search. you will hang me this one. have you your ladder?”

“there is one yonder, under the shed of the pillar-house,” replied the
man. “is it on this justice that the thing is to be done?” he added,
pointing to the stone gibbet.

“yes.”

“ho, hé!” continued the man with a huge laugh, which was still more
brutal than that of the provost, “we shall not have far to go.”

in the parvis, some good women, who had their milk jugs in their
hands, were pointing out to each other, with astonishment, the singular
dilapidation of the great door of notre-dame, and the two solidified
streams of lead in the crevices of the stone. this was all that remained
of the tempest of the night. the bonfire lighted between the towers by
quasimodo had died out. tristan had already cleared up the place, and
had the dead thrown into the seine. kings like louis xi. are careful to
clean the pavement quickly after a massacre.

outside the balustrade of the tower, directly under the point where the
priest had paused, there was one of those fantastically carved stone
gutters with which gothic edifices bristle, and, in a crevice of that
gutter, two pretty wallflowers in blossom, shaken out and vivified,
as it were, by the breath of air, made frolicsome salutations to each
other. above the towers, on high, far away in the depths of the sky, the
cries of little

the archdeacon, quasimodo had disappeared.

a great many rumors were in circulation with regard to this adventure.
no one doubted but that the day had come when, in accordance with their
compact, quasimodo, that is to say, the devil, was to carry off claude
frollo, that is to say, the sorcerer. it was presumed that he had broken
the body when taking the soul, like monkeys who break the shell to get
at the nut.

this is why the archdeacon was not interred in consecrated earth.

louis xi. died a year later, in the month of august, 1483.

as for pierre gringoire, he succeeded in saving the goat, and he won
success in tragedy. it appears that, after having tasted astrology,
philosophy, architecture, hermetics,--all vanities, he returned to
tragedy, vainest pursuit of all. this is what he called “coming to a
tragic end.” this is what is to be read, on the subject of his dramatic
triumphs, in 1483, in the accounts of the “ordinary:” “to jehan marchand
