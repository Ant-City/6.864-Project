e up all the love letters
of his friends. now it is understood that he has composed an original
speech of congratulation and benediction, and this is one of the events
of the day. even the boys, who are romping about the room, draw near and
listen, and some of the women sob and wipe their aprons in their eyes.
it is very solemn, for antanas rudkus has become possessed of the idea
that he has not much longer to stay with his children. his speech leaves
them all so tearful that one of the guests, jokubas szedvilas, who keeps
a delicatessen store on halsted street, and is fat and hearty, is moved
to rise and say that things may not be as bad as that, and then to go on
and make a little speech of his own, in which he showers congratulations
and prophecies of happiness upon the bride and groom, proceeding to
particulars which greatly delight the young men, but which cause ona
to blush more furiously than ever. jokubas possesses what his
wife complacently describes as “poetiszka vaidintuve”--a poetical

 how to waltz, but that is nothing of any
consequence--there is music, and they dance, each as he pleases, just
as before they sang. most of them prefer the “two-step,” especially the
young, with whom it is the fashion. the older people have dances from
home, strange and complicated steps which they execute with grave
solemnity. some do not dance anything at all, but simply hold each
other’s hands and allow the undisciplined joy of motion to express
itself with their feet. among these are jokubas szedvilas and his wife,
lucija, who together keep the delicatessen store, and consume nearly
as much as they sell; they are too fat to dance, but they stand in the
middle of the floor, holding each other fast in their arms, rocking
slowly from side to side and grinning seraphically, a picture of
toothless and perspiring ecstasy.

of these older people many wear clothing reminiscent in some detail
of home--an embroidered waistcoat or stomacher, or a gaily colored
handkerchief, or a coat with large cuffs a

law about it, you might as well go to heaven at once. the saloon-keeper
stood in with all the big politics men in the district; and when you had
once found out what it meant to get into trouble with such people, you
would know enough to pay what you were told to pay and shut up.

what made all this the more painful was that it was so hard on the few
that had really done their best. there was poor old ponas jokubas, for
instance--he had already given five dollars, and did not every one know
that jokubas szedvilas had just mortgaged his delicatessen store for two
hundred dollars to meet several months’ overdue rent? and then there was
withered old poni aniele--who was a widow, and had three children, and
the rheumatism besides, and did washing for the tradespeople on halsted
street at prices it would break your heart to hear named. aniele had
given the entire profit of her chickens for several months. eight of
them she owned, and she kept them in a little place fenced around on her
backstairs. all day

all the sordid
suggestions of the place were gone--in the twilight it was a vision of
power. to the two who stood watching while the darkness swallowed it up,
it seemed a dream of wonder, with its talc of human energy, of things
being done, of employment for thousands upon thousands of men, of
opportunity and freedom, of life and love and joy. when they came away,
arm in arm, jurgis was saying, “tomorrow i shall go there and get a
job!”



chapter 3


in his capacity as delicatessen vender, jokubas szedvilas had many
acquaintances. among these was one of the special policemen employed
by durham, whose duty it frequently was to pick out men for employment.
jokubas had never tried it, but he expressed a certainty that he could
get some of his friends a job through this man. it was agreed, after
consultation, that he should make the effort with old antanas and with
jonas. jurgis was confident of his ability to get work for himself,
unassisted by any one. as we have said before, he was not mistaken in

nd even the imperturbable delicatessen vender,
who prided himself upon being a businessman, was ill at ease. the agent
had the deed all ready, and invited them to sit down and read it; this
szedvilas proceeded to do--a painful and laborious process, during which
the agent drummed upon the desk. teta elzbieta was so embarrassed that
the perspiration came out upon her forehead in beads; for was not this
reading as much as to say plainly to the gentleman’s face that they
doubted his honesty? yet jokubas szedvilas read on and on; and presently
there developed that he had good reason for doing so. for a horrible
suspicion had begun dawning in his mind; he knitted his brows more and
more as he read. this was not a deed of sale at all, so far as he could
see--it provided only for the renting of the property! it was hard
to tell, with all this strange legal jargon, words he had never heard
before; but was not this plain--“the party of the first part hereby
covenants and agrees to rent to the said party of
