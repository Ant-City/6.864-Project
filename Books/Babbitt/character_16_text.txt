our bank, for example, i hope i may say that we have as modern a method
of publicity and advertising as any in the city. yes, i fancy you'll
find us oldsters quite cognizant of the shifting spiritual values of the
age. yes, oh yes. and so, in fact, it pleases me to be able to say
that though personally i might prefer the sterner presbyterianism of an
earlier era--"

babbitt finally gathered that eathorne was willing.

chum frink suggested as part-time press-agent one kenneth escott,
reporter on the advocate-times.

they parted on a high plane of amity and christian helpfulness.

babbitt did not drive home, but toward the center of the city. he wished
to be by himself and exult over the beauty of intimacy with william
washington eathorne.

a snow-blanched evening of ringing pavements and eager lights.

great golden lights of trolley-cars sliding along the packed snow of the
roadway. demure lights of little houses. the belching glare of a distant

on--anyway, not bad. had too much of this hooptedoodle and good-fellow

he drove happily home, and to mrs. babbitt he was a william washington
eathorne, but she did not notice it.

young kenneth escott, reporter on the advocate-times was appointed
press-agent of the chatham road presbyterian sunday school. he gave six
hours a week to it. at least he was paid for giving six hours a week.
he had friends on the press and the gazette and he was not (officially)
known as a press-agent. he procured a trickle of insinuating items
about neighborliness and the bible, about class-suppers, jolly but
educational, and the value of the prayer-life in attaining financial
success.

the sunday school adopted

of heaven included in the parsonage of dr. drew, while babbitt had much
praise and good repute.

he had received the rank of colonel on the general staff of the school.
he was plumply pleased by salutes on the street from unknown small
boys; his ears were tickled to ruddy ecstasy by hearing himself called
"colonel;" and if he did not attend sunday school merely to be thus
exalted, certainly he thought about it all the way there.

he was particularly pleasant to the press-agent, kenneth escott; he took
him to lunch at the athletic club and had him at the house for dinner.

like many of the cocksure young men who forage about cities in apparent
contentment and who express their cynicism in supercilious slang, escott
was shy and lonely. his shrewd starveling face broadened with joy at
dinner, and he blurted, "gee whillikins, mrs. babbitt, if you knew how
good it is to have home eats again!"

escott and verona liked each other. all evening they "talked about
ideas." they discovered that

ng the city there was something highbrow and degenerate,
like writing poetry. but now orville jones shouted across the athletic
dining-room, "here's the new director of the first state bank!" grover
butterbaugh, the eminent wholesaler of plumbers' supplies, chuckled,
"wonder you mix with common folks, after holding eathorne's hand!" and
emil wengert, the jeweler, was at last willing to discuss buying a house
in dorchester.

when the sunday school campaign was finished, babbitt suggested to
kenneth escott, "say, how about doing a little boosting for doc drew
personally?"

escott grinned. "you trust the doc to do a little boosting for himself,
mr. babbitt! there's hardly a week goes by without his ringing up the
paper to say if we'll chase a reporter up to his study, he'll let us
in on the story about the swell sermon he's going to preach on the
wickedness of short skirts, or the authorship of the pentateuch. don't
you worry about him. there's just one better publicity-grabber in town,
and that's

he announced to ted,
"i tell you, boy, there's no stronger bulwark of sound conservatism than
the evangelical church, and no better place to make friends who'll
help you to gain your rightful place in the community than in your own
church-home!"

though he saw them twice daily, though he knew and amply discussed every
detail of their expenditures, yet for weeks together babbitt was no more
conscious of his children than of the buttons on his coat-sleeves.

the admiration of kenneth escott made him aware of verona.

she had become secretary to mr. gruensberg of the gruensberg leather
company; she did her work with the thoroughness of a mind which reveres
details and never quite understands them; but she was one of the
people who give an agitating impression of being on the point of doing
something desperate--of leaving a job or a husband--without ever doing
it. babbitt was so hopeful about escott's hesitant ardors that he became
the playful parent. when he returned from the elks

e's no way of telling it. i don't believe that outside of
the office and playing a little bum golf on saturday he knows there's
anything in the world to do except just keep sitting there-sitting
there every night--not wanting to go anywhere--not wanting to do
anything--thinking us kids are crazy--sitting there--lord!"


iv

if he was frightened by ted's slackness, babbitt was not sufficiently
frightened by verona. she was too safe. she lived too much in the neat
little airless room of her mind. kenneth escott and she were always
under foot. when they were not at home, conducting their cautiously
radical courtship over sheets of statistics, they were trudging off to
lectures by authors and hindu philosophers and swedish lieutenants.

"gosh," babbitt wailed to his wife, as they walked home from the
fogartys' bridge-party, "it gets me how rone and that fellow can be so
poky. they sit there night after night, whenever he isn't working,
and they don't know there's any fun in the world. all talk and

that?" he regarded verona's books, babbitt's silver pencil, and flowers
on the table as citified extravagances, and said so. babbitt would have
quarreled with him but for his gawky wife and the baby, whom babbitt
teased and poked fingers at and addressed:

"i think this baby's a bum, yes, sir, i think this little baby's a bum,
he's a bum, yes, sir, he's a bum, that's what he is, he's a bum, this
baby's a bum, he's nothing but an old bum, that's what he is--a bum!"

all the while verona and kenneth escott held long inquiries into
epistemology; ted was a disgraced rebel; and tinka, aged eleven, was
demanding that she be allowed to go to the movies thrice a week, "like
all the girls."

babbitt raged, "i'm sick of it! having to carry three generations. whole
damn bunch lean on me. pay half of mother's income, listen to henry
t., listen to myra's worrying, be polite to mart, and get called an old
grouch for trying to help the children. all of 'em depending on me and
picking on me and not a damn one

f he desired, go mad and curse the gods without
having to keep up a husbandly front. he considered, "i could have a
reg'lar party to-night; stay out till two and not do any explaining
afterwards. cheers!" he telephoned to vergil gunch, to eddie swanson.
both of them were engaged for the evening, and suddenly he was bored by
having to take so much trouble to be riotous.

he was silent at dinner, unusually kindly to ted and verona, hesitating
but not disapproving when verona stated her opinion of kenneth escott's
opinion of dr. john jennison drew's opinion of the opinions of the
evolutionists. ted was working in a garage through the summer vacation,
and he related his daily triumphs: how he had found a cracked ball-race,
what he had said to the old grouch, what he had said to the foreman
about the future of wireless telephony.

ted and verona went to a dance after dinner. even the maid was out.

"well, whenever you're ready, you just hang a towel out of the attic
window and i'll jump for the gin!"

every one giggled at this naughtiness. in a pleased way eddie swanson
stated that he would have a physician analyze his coffee daily. the
others were diverted to a discussion of the more agreeable recent
murders, but babbitt drew louetta back to personal things:

"that's the prettiest dress i ever saw in my life."

"do you honestly like it?"

"like it? why, say, i'm going to have kenneth escott put a piece in the
paper saying that the swellest dressed woman in the u. s. is mrs. e.
louetta swanson."

"now, you stop teasing me!" but she beamed. "let's dance a little.
george, you've got to dance with me."

even as he protested, "oh, you know what a rotten dancer i am!" he was
lumbering to his feet.

"i'll teach you. i can teach anybody."

her eyes were moist, her voice was jagged with excitement. he was
convinced that he had won her. he clasped her, conscious of her smooth
warmth, and so

acquaintances that there was a new george f. babbitt, save that he was
more irritable under the incessant chaffing at the athletic club, and
once, when vergil gunch observed that seneca doane ought to be hanged,
babbitt snorted, "oh, rats, he's not so bad."

at home he grunted "eh?" across the newspaper to his commentatory wife,
and was delighted by tinka's new red tam o'shanter, and announced, "no
class to that corrugated iron garage. have to build me a nice frame
one."

verona and kenneth escott appeared really to be engaged. in
his newspaper escott had conducted a pure-food crusade against
commission-houses. as a result he had been given an excellent job in a
commission-house, and he was making a salary on which he could marry,
and denouncing irresponsible reporters who wrote stories criticizing
commission-houses without knowing what they were talking about.

this september ted had entered the state university as a freshman in the
college of arts and sciences. the university was at mo

ckening in his irritable periodic interest, and now he
had no interest; rather, a revulsion. he was completely faithful--to
tanis. he was distressed by the sight of his wife's slack plumpness, by
her puffs and billows of flesh, by the tattered petticoat which she was
always meaning and always forgetting to throw away. but he was aware
that she, so long attuned to him, caught all his repulsions. he
elaborately, heavily, jocularly tried to check them. he couldn't.

they had a tolerable christmas. kenneth escott was there, admittedly
engaged to verona. mrs. babbitt was tearful and called kenneth her new
son. babbitt was worried about ted, because he had ceased complaining
of the state university and become suspiciously acquiescent. he wondered
what the boy was planning, and was too shy to ask. himself, babbitt
slipped away on christmas afternoon to take his present, a silver
cigarette-box, to tanis. when he returned mrs. babbitt asked, much too
innocently, "did you go out for a little fresh air?"

"yes

er, told him what a nagger eddie
was, and accepted babbitt as a decent and well-trained libertine.

with the assistance of tanis's bunch, the doppelbraus, and other
companions in forgetfulness, there was not an evening for two weeks when
he did not return home late and shaky. with his other faculties blurred
he yet had the motorist's gift of being able to drive when he could
scarce walk; of slowing down at corners and allowing for approaching
cars. he came wambling into the house. if verona and kenneth escott were
about, he got past them with a hasty greeting, horribly aware of their
level young glances, and hid himself up-stairs. he found when he came
into the warm house that he was hazier than he had believed. his head
whirled. he dared not lie down. he tried to soak out the alcohol in a
hot bath. for the moment his head was clearer but when he moved about
the bathroom his calculations of distance were wrong, so that he dragged
down the towels, and knocked over the soap-dish with a clatter which,

thereafter he was often seen at the chatham road presbyterian church,
but it is recorded that he avoided shaking hands with the pastor at the
door.

if his moral fiber had been so weakened by rebellion that he was not
quite dependable in the more rigorous campaigns of the good citizens'
league nor quite appreciative of the church, yet there was no doubt of
the joy with which babbitt returned to the pleasures of his home and of
the athletic club, the boosters, the elks.

verona and kenneth escott were eventually and hesitatingly married.
for the wedding babbitt was dressed as carefully as was verona; he was
crammed into the morning-coat he wore to teas thrice a year; and with a
certain relief, after verona and kenneth had driven away in a limousine,
he returned to the house, removed the morning coat, sat with his aching
feet up on the davenport, and reflected that his wife and he could have
the living-room to themselves now, and not have to listen to verona and
kenneth worrying, in a cu

"good god!" from babbitt, and from his wife a long wailing, "you've gone
and--"

"we got married last evening. wife! sit up and say a pretty good morning
to mother-in-law."

but eunice hid her shoulders and her charming wild hair under the
pillow.

by nine o'clock the assembly which was gathered about ted and eunice
in the living-room included mr. and mrs. george babbitt, dr. and mrs.
howard littlefield, mr. and mrs. kenneth escott, mr. and mrs. henry
t. thompson, and tinka babbitt, who was the only pleased member of the
inquisition.

a crackling shower of phrases filled the room:

"at their age--" "ought to be annulled--" "never heard of such a thing
in--" "fault of both of them and--" "keep it out of the papers--" "ought
to be packed off to school--" "do something about it at once, and what i
say is--" "damn good old-fashioned spanking--"

worst of them all was verona. "ted! some way must be found to make you
