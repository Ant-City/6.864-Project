 whispered douglas. 

a whole summer ahead to cross off the calendar, day by day. like the goddess siva in 
the travel books, he saw his hands jump everywhere, pluck sour apples, peaches, and 
midnight plums. he would be clothed in trees and bushes and rivers. he would freeze, 
gladly, in the hoarfrosted icehouse door. he would bake, happily, with ten thousand 
chickens, in grandma's kitchen. 

but now— a familiar task awaited him. 

one night each week he was allowed to leave his father, his mother, and his younger 
brother tom asleep in their small house next door and run here, up the dark spiral stairs 
to his grandparents' cupola, and in this sorcerer's tower sleep with thunders and visions, 
to wake before the crystal jingle of milk bottles and perform his ritual magic. 

he stood at the open window in the dark, took a deep breath and exhaled. 

the street lights, like candles on a black cake, went out. he exhaled again and again 
and the stars began to vanish.

"hey! hey!" john huff and charlie woodman ran through the mystery of ravine and 
town and time. "hey!" 

douglas moved slowly down the path. the ravine was indeed the place where you 
came to look at the two things of life, the ways of man and the ways of the natural 
world. the town was, after all, only a large ship filled with constantly moving survivors, 
bailing out the grass, chipping away the rust. now and again a lifeboat, a shanty, kin to 
the mother ship, lost out to the quiet storm of seasons, sank down in silent waves of 
termite and ant into swallowing ravine to feel the flicker of grasshoppers rattling like dry 
paper in hot weeds, become soundproofed with spider dust and finally, in avalanche of 
shingle and tar, collapse like kindling shrines into a bonfire, which thunderstorms ignited 
with blue lightning, while flash-photographing the triumph of the wilderness. 

it was this then, the mystery of man seizing from the land and the la

now the second rite waited for him to make the motions, but he stood very still. 

"doug . . .come on . . .doug . . . !"the running boys faded. 

"i'm alive," said douglas. "but what's the use? they're more alive than me. how 
come? how come?" and standing alone, he knew the answer, staring down at his 
motionless feet . . . 



late that night, going home from the show with his mother and father and his brother 
tom, douglas saw the tennis shoes in the bright store window. he glanced quickly away, 
but his ankles were seized, his feet suspended, then rushed. the earth spun; the shop 
awnings slammed their canvas wings overhead with the thrust of his body running. his 
mother and father and brother walked quietly on both sides of him. douglas walked 
backward, watching the tennis shoes in the midnight window left behind. 

"it was a nice movie," said mother.

at last, like ghosts hovering momentarily behind the door screen, grandma, great-

women carried varieties of fans with them, folded newspapers, bamboo whisks, or 
perfumed kerchiefs, to start the air moving about their faces as they talked.

opening the screen door, he found mom still ironing. she looked hot and irritated but 
she smiled just the same. 

"when will dad be home from lodge meeting?" he asked. 

"about eleven or eleven-thirty," mother replied. she took the ice cream to the kitchen, 
divided it. giving him his special portion of chocolate, she dished out some for herself

"he'll be here," tom said, knowing very well that douglas would be. 

he followed mom out to wash the dishes. each sound, each rattle of spoon or dish was 
amplified in the baked evening. silently they went to the living room, removed the couch 
cushions and, together, yanked it open and extended it down into the double bed it 
secretly was. mother made the bed, punching pillows neatly to flump them up for their 
heads. then, as he was unbuttoning his shirt, she said, "wait awhile, tom."

silent radio, the silent phonograph, at the chandelier with the crystal bobbins gleaming 
quietly, at the rug with the scarlet and purple curlicues on it. he stubbed his toe on the 
bed purposely to see if it hurt. it did.

complete lack of life, light, and activity. here and there, back off from where they were 
walking, faint squares of light glowed where people were still up. but most of the houses, 
darkened, were sleeping already, and there were a few lightless places where the 
occupants of a dwelling sat talking low night talk on their front porches. you heard a 
porch swing squeaking as you walked by. 

"i wish your father was home," said mother. her large hand squeezed around his small

safe anymore. you never know when the lonely one'll turn up or where. so help me, 
when doug gets home i'll spank him within an inch of his life."

was, in three seconds a dark tide could rise to take all ten years from him and—

could not look anywhere, in this very instant, save into her heart, and there she would

"nighttime's awful dark— is one." 
"what's the other?" 

"the ravine at night don't belong in mr. auffmann's happiness machine, if he ever 
builds it." 

douglas considered this awhile. "you can say that again." 

they stopped talking. listening, suddenly they heard footsteps coming down the 
street, under the trees, outside the house now, on the sidewalk. from her bed mother

and father carried a cot outside and brought douglas down to sleep in the yard under 
the apple tree where, if there might be a wind, it would find him sooner than in the
