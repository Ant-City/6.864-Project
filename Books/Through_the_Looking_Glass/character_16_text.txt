ou could talk!â€™

â€˜we can talk,â€™ said the tiger-lily: â€˜when thereâ€™s anybody worth talking
to.â€™

alice was so astonished that she could not speak for a minute: it quite
seemed to take her breath away. at length, as the tiger-lily only went
on waving about, she spoke again, in a timid voice--almost in a whisper.
â€˜and can all the flowers talk?â€™

â€˜as well as you can,â€™ said the tiger-lily. â€˜and a great deal louder.â€™

â€˜it isnâ€™t manners for us to begin, you know,â€™ said the rose, â€˜and i
really was wondering when youâ€™d speak! said i to myself, â€œher face has
got some sense in it, though itâ€™s not a clever one!â€ still, youâ€™re the
right colour, and that goes a long way.â€™

â€˜i donâ€™t care about the colour,â€™ the tiger-lily remarked. â€˜if only her
petals curled up a little more, sheâ€™d be all right.â€™

alice didnâ€™t like being criticised, so she began asking questions.
â€˜arenâ€™t you sometimes frightened at being planted out here, with nobody
to take car

e of you?â€™

â€˜thereâ€™s the tree in the middle,â€™ said the rose: â€˜what else is it good
for?â€™

â€˜but what could it do, if any danger came?â€™ alice asked.

â€˜it says â€œbough-wough!â€â€™ cried a daisy: â€˜thatâ€™s why its branches are
called boughs!â€™

â€˜didnâ€™t you know that?â€™ cried another daisy, and here they all began
shouting together, till the air seemed quite full of little shrill
voices. â€˜silence, every one of you!â€™ cried the tiger-lily, waving itself
passionately from side to side, and trembling with excitement. â€˜they
know i canâ€™

â€˜put your hand down, and feel the ground,â€™ said the tiger-lily. â€˜then
youâ€™ll know why.â€™

alice did so. â€˜itâ€™s very hard,â€™ she said, â€˜but i donâ€™t see what that has
to do with it.â€™

â€˜in most gardens,â€™ the tiger-lily said, â€˜they make the beds too soft--so
that the flowers are always asleep.â€™

this sounded a very good reason, and alice was quite pleased to know it.
â€˜i never thought of that before!â€™ she said.

â€˜itâ€™s my opinion that you never think at all,â€™ the rose said in a rather
severe tone.

â€˜i never saw anybody that looked stupider,â€™ a violet said, so suddenly,
that alice quite jumped; for it hadnâ€™t spoken before.

â€˜hold your tongue!â€™ cried the tiger-lily. â€˜as if you ever saw anybody!
you keep your head under the leaves, and snore away there, till you know
no more whatâ€™s going on in the world, than if you were a bud!â€™

â€˜are there any more people in the garden besides me?â€™ alice said, not
choosing to notice the roseâ€™s last remark

.

â€˜thereâ€™s one other flower in the garden that can move about like you,â€™
said the rose. â€˜i wonder how you do it--â€™ (â€˜youâ€™re always wondering,â€™
said the tiger-lily), â€˜but sheâ€™s more bushy than you are.â€™

â€˜is she like me?â€™ alice asked eagerly, for the thought crossed her mind,
â€˜thereâ€™s another little girl in the garden, somewhere!â€™

â€˜well, she has the same awkward shape as you,â€™ the rose said, â€˜but sheâ€™s
redder--and her petals are shorter, i think.â€™

â€˜her petals are done up close, almost like a dahlia,â€™ the tiger-lily
interrupted: â€˜not tumbled about anyhow, like yours.â€™

â€˜but thatâ€™s not your fault,â€™ the rose added kindly: â€˜youâ€™re beginning
to fade, you know--and then one canâ€™t help oneâ€™s petals getting a little
untidy.â€™

alice didnâ€™t like this idea at all: so, to change the subject, she asked
â€˜does she ever come out here?â€™

â€˜i daresay youâ€

™ll see her soon,â€™ said the rose. â€˜sheâ€™s one of the thorny
kind.â€™

â€˜where does she wear the thorns?â€™ alice asked with some curiosity.

â€˜why all round her head, of course,â€™ the rose replied. â€˜i was wondering
you hadnâ€™t got some too. i thought it was the regular rule.â€™

â€˜sheâ€™s coming!â€™ cried the larkspur. â€˜i hear her footstep, thump, thump,
thump, along the gravel-walk!â€™

alice looked round eagerly, and found that it was the red queen. â€˜sheâ€™s
grown a good deal!â€™ was her first remark. she had indeed: when alice
first found her in the ashes, she had been only three inches high--and
here she was, half a head taller than alice herself!

â€˜itâ€™s the fresh

 air that does it,â€™ said the rose: â€˜wonderfully fine air
it is, out here.â€™

â€˜i think iâ€™ll go and meet her,â€™ said alice, for, though the flowers were
interesting enough, she felt that it would be far grander to have a talk
with a real queen.

â€˜you canâ€™t possibly do that,â€™ said the rose: â€˜_i_ should advise you to
walk the other way.â€™

this sounded nonsense to alice, so she said nothing, but set off at
once towards the red queen. to her surprise, she lost sight of her in a
moment, and found herself walking in at the front-door again.

a little provoked, she drew back, and after looking everywhere for the
queen (whom she spied out at last, a long way off), she thought she
would try the plan, this time, of walking in the opposite direction.

it succeeded beautifully. she had

!â€™ cried tweedledum, beginning to stamp about wildly and
tear his hair. â€˜itâ€™s spoilt, of course!â€™ here he looked at tweedledee,
who immediately sat down on the ground, and tried to hide himself under
the umbrella.

alice laid her hand upon his arm, and said in a soothing tone, â€˜you
neednâ€™t be so angry about an old rattle.â€™

â€˜but it isnâ€™t old!â€™ tweedledum cried, in a greater fury than ever. â€˜itâ€™s
new, i tell you--i bought it yesterday--my nice new rattle!â€™ and his
voice rose to a perfect scream.

all this time tweedledee was trying his best to fold up the umbrella,
with himself in it: which was such an extraordinary thing to do, that it
quite took off aliceâ€™s attention from the angry brother. but he couldnâ€™t
quite succeed, and it ended in his rolling over, bundled up in the
umbrella, with only his head out: and there he lay, opening and shutting
his mouth and his large eyes--â€˜looking more like a fish than anything
else,â€™ alice thought.

â€˜of course you agr
