Helen - 
                Charlie's deceased wife. Helen passed away many years before and appears in the story only as a figure in Charlie's dream. She and Charlie loved each other deeply, and it seems they destroyed their relationship for no real reason. Even though their marriage ended badly, they did love each other, which is why Helen appears encouraging and loving in Charlie's dream.
