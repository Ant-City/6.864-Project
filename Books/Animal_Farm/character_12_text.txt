mers sympathised in
principle, but they did not at first give him much help. at heart, each of
them was secretly wondering whether he could not somehow turn jones's
misfortune to his own advantage. it was lucky that the owners of the two
farms which adjoined animal farm were on permanently bad terms. one of
them, which was named foxwood, was a large, neglected, old-fashioned farm,
much overgrown by woodland, with all its pastures worn out and its hedges
in a disgraceful condition. its owner, mr. pilkington, was an easy-going
gentleman farmer who spent most of his time in fishing or hunting
according to the season. the other farm, which was called pinchfield, was
smaller and better kept. its owner was a mr. frederick, a tough, shrewd
man, perpetually involved in lawsuits and with a name for driving hard
bargains. these two disliked each other so much that it was difficult for
them to come to any agreement, even in defence of their own interests.

nevertheless, they were both thoroughly frightened

als from learning
too much about it. at first they pretended to laugh to scorn the idea of
animals managing a farm for themselves. the whole thing would be over in a
fortnight, they said. they put it about that the animals on the manor farm
(they insisted on calling it the manor farm; they would not tolerate the
name "animal farm") were perpetually fighting among themselves and were
also rapidly starving to death. when time passed and the animals had
evidently not starved to death, frederick and pilkington changed their
tune and began to talk of the terrible wickedness that now flourished on
animal farm. it was given out that the animals there practised cannibalism,
tortured one another with red-hot horseshoes, and had their females in
common. this was what came of rebelling against the laws of nature,
frederick and pilkington said.

however, these stories were never fully believed. rumours of a wonderful
farm, where the human beings had been turned out and the animals managed
their own affairs,

very kind of pretext she would run away from work and
go to the drinking pool, where she would stand foolishly gazing at her own
reflection in the water. but there were also rumours of something more
serious. one day, as mollie strolled blithely into the yard, flirting her
long tail and chewing at a stalk of hay, clover took her aside.

"mollie," she said, "i have something very serious to say to you. this
morning i saw you looking over the hedge that divides animal farm from
foxwood. one of mr. pilkington's men was standing on the other side of the
hedge. and--i was a long way away, but i am almost certain i saw this--he
was talking to you and you were allowing him to stroke your nose. what
does that mean, mollie?"

"he didn't! i wasn't! it isn't true!" cried mollie, beginning to prance
about and paw the ground.

"mollie! look me in the face. do you give me your word of honour that that
man was not stroking your nose?"

"it isn't true!" repeated mollie, but she could not look clover in the
face,

rs. one symptom of this was that they
had begun to call animal farm by its proper name and ceased to pretend
that it was called the manor farm. they had also dropped their championship
of jones, who had given up hope of getting his farm back and gone to live
in another part of the county. except through whymper, there was as yet no
contact between animal farm and the outside world, but there were constant
rumours that napoleon was about to enter into a definite business agreement
either with mr. pilkington of foxwood or with mr. frederick of
pinchfield--but never, it was noticed, with both simultaneously.

it was about this time that the pigs suddenly moved into the farmhouse and
took up their residence there. again the animals seemed to remember that a
resolution against this had been passed in the early days, and again
squealer was able to convince them that this was not the case. it was
absolutely necessary, he said, that the pigs, who were the brains of the
farm, should have a quiet place to

all this while no more had been seen of snowball. he was rumoured to be
hiding on one of the neighbouring farms, either foxwood or pinchfield.
napoleon was by this time on slightly better terms with the other farmers
than before. it happened that there was in the yard a pile of timber which
had been stacked there ten years earlier when a beech spinney was cleared.
it was well seasoned, and whymper had advised napoleon to sell it; both
mr. pilkington and mr. frederick were anxious to buy it. napoleon was
hesitating between the two, unable to make up his mind. it was noticed
that whenever he seemed on the point of coming to an agreement with
frederick, snowball was declared to be in hiding at foxwood, while, when
he inclined toward pilkington, snowball was said to be at pinchfield.

suddenly, early in the spring, an alarming thing was discovered. snowball
was secretly frequenting the farm by night! the animals were so disturbed
that they cou

"comrade napoleon!"


napoleon approved of this poem and caused it to be inscribed on the wall
of the big barn, at the opposite end from the seven commandments. it was
surmounted by a portrait of napoleon, in profile, executed by squealer in
white paint.

meanwhile, through the agency of whymper, napoleon was engaged in
complicated negotiations with frederick and pilkington. the pile of timber
was still unsold. of the two, frederick was the more anxious to get hold
of it, but he would not offer a reasonable price. at the same time there
were renewed rumours that frederick and his men were plotting to attack
animal farm and to destroy the windmill, the building of which had aroused
furious jealousy in him. snowball was known to be still skulking on
pinchfield farm. in the middle of the summer the animals were alarmed to
hear that three hens had come forward and con

fessed that, inspired by
snowball, they had entered into a plot to murder napoleon. they were
executed immediately, and fresh precautions for napoleon's safety were
taken. four dogs guarded his bed at night, one at each corner, and a young
pig named pinkeye was given the task of tasting all his food before he ate
it, lest it should be poisoned.

at about the same time it was given out that napoleon had arranged to sell
the pile of timber to mr. pilkington; he was also going to enter into a
regular agreement for the exchange of certain products between animal farm
and foxwood. the relations between napoleon and pilkington, though they
were only conducted through whymper, were now almost friendly. the animals
distrusted pilkington, as a human being, but greatly preferred him to
frederick, whom they both feared and hated. as the summer wore on, and the
windmill neared completion, the rumours of an impending treacherous attack
grew stronger and stro

 and his cockerel, came down to inspect the completed work; he
personally congratulated the animals on their achievement, and announced
that the mill would be named napoleon mill.

two days later the animals were called together for a special meeting in
the barn. they were struck dumb with surprise when napoleon announced that
he had sold the pile of timber to frederick. tomorrow frederick's wagons
would arrive and begin carting it away. throughout the whole period of his
seeming friendship with pilkington, napoleon had really been in secret
agreement with frederick.

all relations with foxwood had been broken off; insulting messages had
been sent to pilkington. the pigeons had been told to avoid pinchfield
farm and to alter their slogan from "death to frederick" to "death to
pilkington." at the same time napoleon assured the animals that the
stories of an impending attack on animal farm were completely untrue, and
that the tales about frederick's cruelty to his own animals had been
greatly exagg

erated. all these rumours had probably originated with
snowball and his agents. it now appeared that snowball was not, after all,
hiding on pinchfield farm, and in fact had never been there in his life:
he was living--in considerable luxury, so it was said--at foxwood, and had
in reality been a pensioner of pilkington for years past.

the pigs were in ecstasies over napoleon's cunning. by seeming to be
friendly with pilkington he had forced frederick to raise his price by
twelve pounds. but the superior quality of napoleon's mind, said squealer,
was shown in the fact that he trusted nobody, not even frederick.
frederick had wanted to pay for the timber with something called a cheque,
which, it seemed, was a piece of paper with a promise to pay written upon
it. but napoleon was too clever for him. he had demanded payment in real
five-pound notes, which were to be handed over before the timber was
removed. already fred

immediately and in a terrible voice
pronounced the death sentence upon frederick. when captured, he said,
frederick should be boiled alive. at the same time he warned them that
after this treacherous deed the worst was to be expected. frederick and
his men might make their long-expected attack at any moment. sentinels
were placed at all the approaches to the farm. in addition, four pigeons
were sent to foxwood with a conciliatory message, which it was hoped might
re-establish good relations with pilkington.

the very next morning the attack came. the animals were at breakfast when
the look-outs came racing in with the news that frederick and his
followers had already come through the five-barred gate. boldly enough the
animals sallied forth to meet them, but this time they did not have the
easy victory that they had had in the battle of the cowshed. there were
fifteen men, with half a dozen guns between them, and they opened fire as
soon as they got within fifty yards. the animals could not face

 stinging pellets, and in spite of the efforts
of napoleon and boxer to rally them, they were soon driven back. a number
of them were already wounded. they took refuge in the farm buildings and
peeped cautiously out from chinks and knot-holes. the whole of the big
pasture, including the windmill, was in the hands of the enemy. for the
moment even napoleon seemed at a loss. he paced up and down without a
word, his tail rigid and twitching. wistful glances were sent in the
direction of foxwood. if pilkington and his men would help them, the day
might yet be won. but at this moment the four pigeons, who had been sent
out on the day before, returned, one of them bearing a scrap of paper from
pilkington. on it was pencilled the words: "serves you right."

meanwhile frederick and his men had halted about the windmill. the animals
watched them, and a murmur of dismay went round. two of the men had
produced a crowbar and a sledge hammer. they were going to knock the
windmill down.

the rebellion and the principles of animalism, especially from clover, for
whom they had an almost filial respect; but it was doubtful whether they
understood very much of it.

the farm was more prosperous now, and better organised: it had even been
enlarged by two fields which had been bought from mr. pilkington. the
windmill had been successfully completed at last, and the farm possessed a
threshing machine and a hay elevator of its own, and various new buildings
had been added to it. whymper had bought himself a dogcart. the windmill,
however, had not after all been used for generating electrical power. it
was used for milling corn, and brought in a handsome money profit. the
animals were hard at work building yet another windmill; when that one was
finished, so it was said, the dynamos would be inst

w. there, round the long table, sat half
a dozen farmers and half a dozen of the more eminent pigs, napoleon
himself occupying the seat of honour at the head of the table. the pigs
appeared completely at ease in their chairs. the company had been enjoying
a game of cards but had broken off for the moment, evidently in order to
drink a toast. a large jug was circulating, and the mugs were being
refilled with beer. no one noticed the wondering faces of the animals that
gazed in at the window.

mr. pilkington, of foxwood, had stood up, his mug in his hand. in a
moment, he said, he would ask the present company to drink a toast. but
before doing so, there were a few words that he felt it incumbent upon him
to say.

it was a source of great satisfaction to him, he said--and, he was sure,
to all others present--to feel that a long period of mistrust and
misunderstanding had now come to an end. there had been a time--not that
he, or any of the present company, had shared such sentiments--but there

he would end his remarks, he said, by emphasising once again the friendly
feelings that subsisted, and ought to subsist, between animal farm and its
neighbours. between pigs and human beings there was not, and there need
not be, any clash of interests whatever. their struggles and their
difficulties were one. was not the labour problem the same everywhere?
here it became apparent that mr. pilkington was about to spring some
carefully prepared witticism on the company, but for a moment he was too
overcome by amusement to be able to utter it. after much choking, during
which his various chins turned purple, he managed to get it out: "if you
have your lower animals to contend with," he said, "we have our lower
classes!" this bon mot set the table in a roar; and mr. pilkington once
again congratulated the pigs on the low rations, the long working hours,
and the general absence of pampering whi

ch he had observed on animal farm.

and now, he said finally, he would ask the company to rise to their feet
and make certain that their glasses were full. "gentlemen," concluded
mr. pilkington, "gentlemen, i give you a toast: to the prosperity of
animal farm!"

there was enthusiastic cheering and stamping of feet. napoleon was so
gratified that he left his place and came round the table to clink his
mug against mr. pilkington's before emptying it. when the cheering had
died down, napoleon, who had remained on his feet, intimated that he too
had a few words to say.

like all of napoleon's speeches, it was short and to the point. he too,
he said, was happy that the period of misunderstanding was at an end. for
a long time there had been rumours--circulated, he had reason to think,
by some malignant enemy--that there was something subversive and even
revolutionary in the outlook of himself and his colleagues. they had

garden. this, too, would be suppressed, and the skull had already been
buried. his visitors might have observed, too, the green flag which flew
from the masthead. if so, they would perhaps have noted that the white
hoof and horn with which it had previously been marked had now been
removed. it would be a plain green flag from now onwards.

he had only one criticism, he said, to make of mr. pilkington's excellent
and neighbourly speech. mr. pilkington had referred throughout to
"animal farm." he could not of course know--for he, napoleon, was only
now for the first time announcing it--that the name "animal farm"
had been abolished. henceforward the farm was to be known as "the manor
farm"--which, he believed, was its correct and original name.

"gentlemen," concluded napoleon, "i will give you the same toast as
before, but in a different form. fill your glasses to the brim. gentlemen,

having come to an end, the company took up their cards and continued the
game that had been interrupted, and the animals crept silently away.

but they had not gone twenty yards when they stopped short. an uproar of
voices was coming from the farmhouse. they rushed back and looked through
the window again. yes, a violent quarrel was in progress. there were
shoutings, bangings on the table, sharp suspicious glances, furious
denials. the source of the trouble appeared to be that napoleon and
mr. pilkington had each played an ace of spades simultaneously.

twelve voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike. no question,
now, what had happened to the faces of the pigs. the creatures outside
looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again;
but already it was impossible to say which was which.
