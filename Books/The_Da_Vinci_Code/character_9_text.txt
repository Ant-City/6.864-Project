for blythe... again. more than ever.

chapter 1

robert langdon awoke slowly.

a telephone was ringing in the darkness — a tinny, unfamiliar ring. he fumbled for the bedside
lamp and turned it on. squinting at his surroundings he saw a plush renaissance bedroom with
louis xvi furniture, hand-frescoed walls, and a colossal mahogany four-poster bed.

where the hell am i?

the jacquard bathrobe hanging on his bedpost bore the monogram: hotel ritz paris.

slowly, the fog began to lift.

langdon picked up the receiver. "hello?"

"monsieur langdon?" a man's voi

ce said. "i hope i have not awoken you?"

dazed, langdon looked at the bedside clock. it was 12:32 a.m. he had been asleep only an hour,
but he felt like the dead.

"this is the concierge, monsieur. i apologize for this intrusion, but you have a visitor. he insists it
is urgent."

langdon still felt fuzzy. a visitor? his eyes focused now on a crumpled flyer on his bedside table.

langdon groaned. tonight's lecture — a slide show about pagan symbolism hidden in the stones of
chartres cathedral — had probably ruffled some conservative feathers in the audience. most likely,



some religious scholar had trailed him home to pick a fight.

"i'm sorry," langdon said, "but i'm very tired and — "

"mais, monsieur, " the concierge pressed, lowering his voice to an urgent whisper. "your guest is
an important man."

it hard over his shoulder, feeling the knots slap against his back. he whipped it over his shoulder
again, slashing at his flesh. again and again, he lashed.

finally, he felt the blood begin to flow.



chapter 3

the crisp april air whipped through the open window of the citroen zx as it skimmed south past
the opera house and crossed place vendome. in the passenger seat, robert langdon felt the city
tear past him as he tried to clear his thoughts. his quick shower and shave had left him looking
reasonably presentable but had done little to ease his anxiety. the frightening image of the
curator's body remained locked in his mind.

jacques sauniere is dead.

langdon could not help but feel a deep sense of loss at the curator's death. despite sauniere's
reputation for being reclusive, his recognition for dedication to the arts made him an easy man to
revere. his books on the sec

hal, dressed in a dark double-breasted suit that strained to cover his wide shoulders. he
advanced with unmistakable authority on squat, powerful legs. he was speaking on his cell phone
but finished the call as he arrived. he motioned for langdon to enter.



"i am bezu fache," he announced as langdon pushed through the revolving door. "captain of the
central directorate judicial police." his tone was fitting — a guttural rumble... like a gathering
storm.

langdon held out his hand to shake. "robert langdon."

fache's enormous palm wrapped around langdon's with crushing force.

"i saw the photo," langdon said. "your agent said jacques sauniere himself did — "

"mr. langdon," fache's ebony eyes locked on. "what you see in the photo is only the beginning of
what sauniere did."



chapter 4

captain bezu fache carried himself like an angry ox, with his wide shoulders thrown back and his
chin tucked hard into his chest. his dark hair was slicked back with oil, accentuating an arrow-like
widow's peak

tonight, silas had been called to battle.

drying his wounds, he donned his ankle-length, hooded robe. it was plain, made of dark wool,
accentuating the whiteness of his skin and hair. tightening the rope-tie around his waist, he raised
the hood over his head and allowed his red eyes to admire his reflection in the mirror. the wheels
are in motion.



chapter 6

having squeezed beneath the security gate, robert langdon now stood just inside the entrance to
the grand gallery. he was staring into the mouth of a long, deep canyon. on either side of the
gallery, stark walls rose thirty feet, evaporating into the darkness above. the reddish glow of the
service lighting sifted upward, casting an unnatural smolder across a staggering collection of da
vincis, titians, and caravaggios that hung suspended from ceiling cables. still lifes, religious
scenes, and landscapes accompanied portraits of nobility and politician

o his laptop computer, collet attended to the other half of his responsibilities here
tonight — the gps tracking system. the image onscreen revealed a detailed floor plan of the denon
wing, a structural schematic uploaded from the louvre security office. letting his eyes trace the
maze of galleries and hallways, collet found what he was looking for.

deep in the heart of the grand gallery blinked a tiny red dot.

fache was keeping his prey on a very tight leash tonight. wisely so. robert langdon had proven
himself one cool customer.



chapter 9

to ensure his conversation with mr. langdon would not be interrupted, bezu fache had turned off
his cellular phone. unfortunately, it was an expensive model equipped with a two-way radio
feature, which, contrary to his orders, was now being used by one of his agents to page him.

"capitaine?" the phone crackled like a walkie-talkie.

fache felt his teeth clench in rage. he could imagine nothing important enough that collet would
interrupt this

logy continually exasperated the veteran french
cryptographers above her. and by far the most troubling to fache was the inescapable universal
truth that in an office of middle-aged men, an attractive young woman always drew eyes away
from the work at hand.

the man on the radio said, "agent neveu insisted on speaking to you immediately, captain. i tried
to stop her, but she's on her way into the gallery. "

fache recoiled in disbelief. "unacceptable! i made it very clear — "



for a moment, robert langdon thought bezu fache was suffering a stroke. the captain was mid-
sentence when his jaw stopped moving and his eyes bulged. his blistering gaze seemed fixated on
something over langdon's shoulder. before langdon could turn to see what it was, he heard a
woman's voice chime out behind him.

"excusez-moi, messieurs. "

langdon turned to see a young woman approaching. she was moving down the corridor toward
them with long, fluid strides... a haunting certainty to her gait. dressed casually in a knee

than a slap on the wrist.

and the embassy invariably did just that.

l 'emasculation de la police judiciaire, fache called it. paris match had run a cartoon recently
depicting fache as a police dog, trying to bite an american criminal, but unable to reach because it
was chained to the u.s. embassy.

not tonight, fache told himself. there is far too much at stake.



by the time robert langdon hung up the phone, he looked ill.

"is everything all right?" fache asked.

weakly, langdon shook his head.

bad news from home, fache sensed, noticing langdon was sweating slightly as fache took back
his cell phone.

"an accident," langdon stammered, looking at fache with a strange expression. "a friend..." he
hesitated. "i'll need to fly home first thing in the morning."

fache had no doubt the shock on langdon's face was genuine, and yet he sensed another emotion
there too, as if a distant f

 from his mind, fache stared for a moment at the miniature knight standing on
sauniere's desk. then he turned back to collet. "do you have him?"

collet gave a curt nod and spun the laptop toward fache. the red dot was clearly visible on the
floor plan overlay, blinking methodically in a room marked toilettes publiques.

"good," fache said, lighting a cigarette and stalking into the hall. i've got a phone call to make. be
damned sure the rest room is the only place langdon goes."



chapter 12

robert langdon felt light-headed as he trudged toward the end of the grand gallery. sophie's
phone message played over and over in his mind. at the end of the corridor, illuminated signs
bearing the international stick-figure symbols for rest rooms guided him through a maze-like series
of dividers displaying italian drawings and hiding the rest rooms from sight.



finding the men's room door, langdon entered and turned on the lights.

the room was empty.

ter pocket and began unfolding it.
"fache uploaded images of the crime scene to the cryptology department earlier tonight in hopes
we could figure out what sauniere's message was trying to say. this is a photo of the complete
message." she handed the page to langdon.

bewildered, langdon looked at the image. the close-up photo revealed the glowing message on
the parquet floor. the final line hit langdon like a kick in the gut.

chapter 13

for several seconds, langdon stared in wonder at the photograph of sauniere's postscript. p.s.
find robert langdon. he felt as if the floor were tilting beneath his feet. sauniere left a postscript
with my name on it? in his wildest dreams, langdon could not fathom why.



"now do you understand," sophie said, her eyes urgent, "why fache ordered you here tonight, and
why you are his primary suspect?"

the only thing langdon understood at the moment was why fache had looked so smu

"why would sauniere write this?" langdon demanded, his confusion now giving way to anger.
"why would i want to kill jacques sauniere?"

"fache has yet to uncover a motive, but he has been recording his entire conversation with you
tonight in hopes you might reveal one."

langdon opened his mouth, but still no words came.

"he's fitted with a miniature microphone," sophie explained. "it's connected to a transmitter in his
pocket that radios the signal back to the command post."

"this is impos

such a hurry that he just didn't realize how it would look to the police." she paused. "the numbered
code is meaningless. sauniere wrote it to make sure the investigation included cryptographers,
ensuring that / would know as soon as possible what had happened to him."

langdon felt himself losing touch fast. whether or not sophie neveu had lost her mind was at this
point up for grabs, but at least langdon now understood why she was trying to help him. p.s. find
robert langdon. she apparently believed the curator had left her a cryptic postscript telling her to
find langdon. "but why do you think his message was for you?"

"the vitruvian man, " she said flatly. "that particular sketch has always been my favorite da vinci
work. tonight he used it to catch my attention."

"hold on. you're saying the curator knew your favorite piece of art?" she nodded. "i'm sorry. this
is all coming out of order. jacques sauniere and i..."

sophie's voice caught, and langdon heard a su

 us something. i'm sorry i'm so little help."

sophie turned from the window, sensing a sincere regret in langdon's deep voice. even with all the
trouble around him, he obviously wanted to help her. the teacher in him, she thought, having read
dcpj's workup on their suspect. this was an academic who clearly despised not understanding.

we have that in common, she thought.

as a codebreaker, sophie made her living extracting meaning from seemingly senseless data.
tonight, her best guess was that robert langdon, whether he knew it or not, possessed information
that she desperately needed. princesse sophie, find robert langdon. how much clearer could her
grandfather's message be? sophie needed more time with langdon. time to think. time to sort out
this mystery together. unfortunately, time was running out.

gazing up at langdon, sophie made the only play she could think of. "bezu fache will be taking
you into custody at any minute. i can get you out of this museum. but we need to act now."

langdon behind bars tonight, at any cost. sophie needed langdon for herself, and it was this
dilemma that left sophie only one logical conclusion.

turning toward the window, sophie gazed through the alarm mesh embedded in the plate glass,
down the dizzying forty feet to the pavement below. a leap from this height would leave langdon
with a couple of broken legs. at best.

nonetheless, sophie made her decision.

robert langdon was about to escape the louvre, whether he wanted to or not.



chapter 17

"what do you mean she's not answering?" fache looked incredulous. "you're calling her cell
phone, right? i know she's carrying it."

collet had been trying to reach sophie now for several minutes. "maybe her batteries are dead. or
her ringer's off."

fache had looked distressed ever since talking to the director of cryptology on the phone. after
hanging up, he had marched over to collet and demanded he get agent neveu o

ould never imagine."



"come on," sophie whispered. "what's wrong? we're almost there. hurry!"

langdon glanced up, feeling himself return from faraway thoughts. he realized he was standing at
a dead stop on the stairs, paralyzed by sudden revelation.

o, draconian devil! oh, lame saint!

sophie was looking back at him.

it can 't be that simple, langdon thought.

but he knew of course that it was.

there in the bowels of the louvre... with images of phi and da vinci swirling through his mind,
robert langdon suddenly and unexpectedly deciphered sauniere's code.

"o, draconian devil!" he said. "oh, lame saint! it's the simplest kind of code!"



sophie was stopped on the stairs below him, staring up in confusion. a code? she had been
pondering the words all night and had not seen a code. especially a simple one.

"you said it yourself." langdon's voice reverberated with excitement. "fibonacci numbers only
have meaning in their proper order. otherwise they're mathematical gibberish. "

"but if he wanted to tell you why you were in danger, why wouldn't he simply write it on the floor
where he died? why this complicated word game?"

"whatever my grandfather was trying to tell me, i don't think he wanted anyone else to hear it. not
even the police." clearly, her grandfather had done everything in his power to send a confidential
transmission directly to her. he had written it in code, included her secret initials, and told her to
find robert langdon — a wise command, considering the american symbologist had deciphered his
code. "as strange as it may sound," sophie said, "i think he wants me to get to the mona lisa
before anyone else does."

"i'llcome."

"no! we don't know how long the grand gallery will stay empty. you have to go."

langdon seemed hesitant, as if his own academic curiosity were threatening to override sound
judgment and drag him back into fache's hands.

"go. now." sophie gave him a grateful smile. "i'll see you at the e

t he might awake with a start
in his bed in cambridge. the entire evening had felt like a bizarre dream. i'm about to dash out of
the louvre... a fugitive.

sauniere's clever anagrammatic message was still on his mind, and langdon wondered what
sophie would find at the mona lisa... if anything. she had seemed certain her grandfather meant
for her to visit the famous painting one more time. as plausible an interpretation as this seemed,
langdon felt haunted now by a troubling paradox.

p.s. find robert langdon.

sauniere had written langdon's name on the floor, commanding sophie to find him. but why?
merely so langdon could help her break an anagram?

it seemed quite unlikely.

after all, sauniere had no reason to think langdon was especially skilled at anagrams. we've never
even met. more important, sophie had stated flat out that she should have broken the anagram on
her own. it had been sophie who spotted the fibonacci sequence, and, no doubt, sophie who, if
given a little more time, would have de

ram on her own. langdon was suddenly feeling more
certain about this, and yet the conclusion left an obvious gaping lapse in the logic of sauniere's
actions.

why me? langdon wondered, heading down the hall. why was sauniere's dying wish that his
estranged granddaughter find me? what is it that sauniere thinks i know?

with an unexpected jolt, langdon stopped short. eyes wide, he dug in his pocket and yanked out
the computer printout. he stared at the last line of sauniere's message.

p.s. find robert langdon.

he fixated on two letters.

p.s.

in that instant, langdon felt sauniere's puzzling mix of symbolism fall into stark focus. like a peal
of thunder, a career's worth of symbology and history came crashing down around him. everything
jacques sauniere had done tonight suddenly made perfect sense.

langdon's thoughts raced as he tried to assemble the implications of what this all meant. wheeling,
he stared back in the direction from which he had come.

he knew it didn't matter.

om that day on, they never again spoke of the key. and she became his princess sophie.



inside the salle des etats, sophie stood in silence and endured the sharp pang of loss.

"the initials," langdon whispered, eyeing her strangely. "have you seen them?"

sophie sensed her grandfather's voice whispering in the corridors of the museum. never speak of
this key, sophie. to me or to anyone. she knew she had failed him in forgiveness, and she
wondered if she could break his trust again. p.s. find robert langdon. her grandfather wanted
langdon to help. sophie nodded. "yes, i saw the initials p.s. once. when i was very young."

"where?"

sophie hesitated. "on something very important to him."

langdon locked eyes with her. "sophie, this is crucial. can you tell me if the initials appeared with
a symbol? a fleur-de-lis?"

sophie felt herself staggering backward in amazement. "but... how could you possibly know that!"

langdon exhaled and lowered his voice. "i'm fairly certain your grandfather was a membe

agent neveu is probably in there with him."

"agent neveu left, i thought."

"did you actually see her leave?"

"no, sir, but—"

"well, nobody on the perimeter saw her leave either. they only saw her go in."

collet was flabbergasted by sophie neveu's bravado. she's still inside the building?

"handle it," fache ordered. "i want langdon and neveu at gunpoint by the time i get back."



as the trailor truck drove off, captain fache rounded up his men. robert langdon had proven an
elusive quarry tonight, and with agent neveu now helping him, he might be far harder to corner
than expected.



fache decided not to take any chances.

hedging his bets, he ordered half of his men back to the louvre perimeter. the other half he sent to
guard the only location in paris where robert langdon could find safe harbor.

chapter 30

security warden claude grouard simmered with rage as he stood over his prostrate captive in front
of the mona lisa. this bastard killed jacques sauniere! sauniere had been like a well-loved father
to grouard and his security team.



grouard wanted nothing more than to pull the trigger and bury a bullet in robert langdon's back.
as senior warden, grouard was one of the few guards who actually carried a loaded weapon. he
reminded himself, however, that killing langdon would be a generous fate compared to the misery
about to be communicated by bezu fache and the french prison system.

grouard yanked his walkie-talkie off his belt and attempted to radio for backup. all he heard was
static. the additional electronic security in this chamber always wrought havoc with the guards'
communications. / have to move to the

somewhere in the distant recesses of grouard's mind, the name registered. sophie neveu? that

that was years ago. this couldn't possibly be her! and even if it were sophie neveu, that was
hardly a reason to trust her; grouard had heard the rumors of the painful falling-out between
sauniere and his granddaughter.

"you know me," the woman called. "and robert langdon did not kill my grandfather. believe
me."

warden grouard was not about to take that on faith. / need backup! trying his walkie-talkie again,

leaving, the banker closed the door behind him and twisted a heavy lock, sealing them inside.



across town, collet was standing in the gare du nord train terminal when his phone rang.

it was fache. "interpol got a tip," he said. "forget the train. langdon and neveu just walked into
the paris branch of the depository bank of zurich. i want your men over there right away."

"any leads yet on what sauniere was trying to tell agent neveu and robert langdon?"

fache's tone was cold. "if you arrest them, lieutenant collet, then i can ask them personally."

collet took the hint. "twenty-four rue haxo. right away, captain." he hung up and radioed his
men.

the agent held up a passport picture of robert langdon. "was this man in your bank tonight?"

vernet shrugged. "no clue. i'm a dock rat. they don't let us anywhere near the clients. you need to

"your bank is demanding a search warrant before we can enter."

vernet put on a disgusted look. "administrators. don't get me started."

why not jacques sauniere ?

langdon's incredulity intensified with the realization that he had been slated to meet sauniere
tonight. the priory grand master called a meeting with me. why? to make artistic small talk? it
suddenly seemed unlikely. after all, if langdon's instincts were correct, the grand master of the
priory of sion had just transferred the brotherhood's legendary keystone to his granddaughter and
simultaneously commanded her to find robert langdon.

inconceivable!

langdon's imagination could conjure no set of circumstances that would explain sauniere's
behavior. even if sauniere feared his own death, there were three senechaux who also possessed
the secret and therefore guaranteed the priory's security. why would sauniere take such an
enormous risk giving his granddaughter the keystone, especially when the two of them didn't get
along? and why involve langdon... a total stranger?

apiece of this puzzle is missing, langdon thought.

the door exploded outward, striking vernet in the face and sending him reeling backward onto the
ground, his nose shattering in pain. the gun flew as vernet reached for his face and felt the warm
blood running from his nose.

robert langdon hit the ground somewhere nearby, and vernet tried to get up, but he couldn't see.
his vision blurred and he fell backward again. sophie neveu was shouting. moments later, vernet
felt a cloud of dirt and exhaust billowing over him. he heard the crunching of tires on gravel and
sat up just in time to see the truck's wide wheelbase fail to navigate a turn. there was a crash as the

frowning, she replaced it in the rosewood box and closed the lid. looking outside at langdon,
sophie felt grateful he was with her tonight. p.s. find robert langdon. her grandfather's rationale
for including him was now clear. sophie was not equipped to understand her grandfather's
intentions, and so he had assigned robert langdon as her guide. a tutor to oversee her education.
unfortunately for langdon, he had turned out to be far more than a tutor tonight. he had become
the target of bezu fache... and some unseen force intent on possessing the holy grail.

whatever the grail turns out to be.

sophie wondered if finding out was worth her life.

sophie rolled down her window. "robert, you'd better do the talking."

langdon shifted his position, leaning out across sophie to press the intercom button. as he did, an
alluring whiff of sophie's perfume filled his nostrils, and he realized how close they were. he
waited there, awkwardly prone, while a telephone began ringing over the small speaker.

finally, the intercom crackled and an irritated french accent spoke. "chateau villette. who is
calling?"

"this is robert langdon," langdon called out, sprawled across sophie's lap. "i'm a friend of sir
leigh teabing. i need his help."

"my master is sleeping. as was i. what is your business with him?"

"it is a private matter. one of great interest to him."

"then i'm sure he will be pleased to receive you in the morning."

langdon shifted his weight. "it's quite important."

"as is sir leigh's sleep. if you are a friend, then you are aware he is in poor health."

again. grand-pere is gone. she pictured the cryptex under the divan and wondered if leigh
teabing would have any idea how to open it. or if we even should ask him. sophie's grandfather's
final words had instructed her to find robert langdon. he had said nothing about involving anyone
else. we needed somewhere to hide, sophie said, deciding to trust robert's judgment.

"sir robert!" a voice bellowed somewhere behind them. "i see you travel with a maiden."

langdon stood up. sophie jumped to her feet as well. the voice had come from the top of a curled
staircase that snaked up to the shadows of the second floor. at the top of the stairs, a form moved
in the shadows, only his silhouette visible.

moreover, collet realized, if langdon were innocent, it explained one of this case's strangest
paradoxes: why had sophie neveu, the granddaughter of the victim, helped the alleged killer
escape? unless sophie knew langdon was falsely charged. fache had posited all kinds of
explanations tonight to explain sophie's odd behavior, including that sophie, as sauniere's sole
heir, had persuaded her secret lover robert langdon to kill off sauniere for the inheritance money.
sauniere, if he had suspected this, might have left the police the message p.s. find robert

a weapon was discharged inside a private home! and you waited at the bottom of the driveway?

collet knew the opportunity for a stealth approach had long since passed. he also knew if he stood
idly by for another second, his entire career would be history by morning. eyeing the estate's iron
gate, he made his decision.

"tie on, and pull it down."



in the distant recesses of his groggy mind, robert langdon had heard the gunshot. he'd also heard
a scream of pain. his own? a jackhammer was boring a hole into the back of his cranium.
somewhere nearby, people were talking.

"where the devil were you?" teabing was yelling.

the manservant hurried in. "what happened? oh my god! who is that? i'll call the police!"

"bloody hell! don't call the police. make yourself useful and get us something with which to
restrain this monster."

"and some ice!" sophie called after him.

"how do i dial the states?"

"you need to reverse the charges. my service doesn't cover transatlantic."

langdon dialed zero, knowing that the next sixty seconds might answer a question that had been
puzzling him all night.



chapter 68

new york editor jonas faukman had just climbed into bed for the night when the telephone rang.
a little late for callers, he grumbled, picking up the receiver.

an operator's voice asked him, "will you accept charges for a collect call from robert langdon?"

puzzled, jonas turned on the light. "uh... sure, okay."

the line clicked. "jonas?"

"robert? you wake me up and you charge me for it?"

"jonas, forgive me," langdon said. "i'll keep this very short. i really need to know. the manuscript
i gave you. have you — "

"robert, i'm sorry, i know i said i'd send the edits out to you this week, but i'm swamped. next
monday. i promise."

"i'm not worried about the edits. i need to know if you sent any copies out for blurbs without
telling me?"

apparently on the side of making the documents public. "i simply
provided history on the brotherhood and described them as a modern goddess worship society,
keepers of the grail, and guardians of ancient documents."

sophie looked at him. "did you mention the keystone?"

langdon winced. he had. numerous times. "i talked about the supposed keystone as an example of
the lengths to which the priory would go to protect the sangreal documents."

sophie looked amazed. "i guess that explains p.s. find robert langdon. "

langdon sensed it was actually something else in the manuscript that had piqued sauniere's
interest, but that topic was something he would discuss with sophie when they were alone.

"so," sophie said, "you lied to captain fache."

"what?" langdon demanded.

"you told him you had never corresponded with my grandfather."

"i didn't! my editor sent him a manuscript."

"think about it, robert. if captain fache didn't find the envelope in which your editor sent the
manuscript, he would have to c

at the rear of the plane, remy legaludec strained to hear beyond the rumbling engines, but the

all. he looked down at the bound monk at his feet. the man lay perfectly still now, as if in a trance
of acceptance, or perhaps, in silent prayer for deliverance.



chapter 72

fifteen thousand feet in the air, robert langdon felt the physical world fade away as all of his
thoughts converged on sauniere's mirror-image poem, which was illuminated through the lid of the
box.

sophie quickly found some paper and copied it down longhand. when she was done, the three of
them took turns reading the text. it was like some kind of archaeological crossword... a riddle that
promised to reveal how to open the cryptex. langdon read the verse slowly.

"not my home. the home of the world's foremost grail historian, sir leigh teabing."

"but you live there. the odds..."

remy smiled, seeming to have no trouble with the apparent coincidence of langdon's chosen
refuge. "it was all utterly predictable. robert langdon was in possession of the keystone, and he
needed help. what more logical place to run than to the home of leigh teabing? that i happen to
live there is why the teacher approached me in the first place." he paused. "how do you think the
teacher knows so much about the grail?"

now it dawned, and silas was stunned. the teacher had recruited a servant who had access to all
of sir leigh teabing's research. it was brilliant.

by an enormous round table around which king arthur and his knights might have been
comfortable were it not for the presence of twelve flat-screen computer workstations. on the far
side of the room, a reference librarian was just pouring a pot of tea and settling in for her day of
work.

"lovely morning," she said in a cheerful british accent, leaving the tea and walking over. "may i

"thank you, yes," langdon replied. "my name is — "

"robert langdon." she gave a pleasant smile. "i know who you are."

for an instant, he feared fache had put him on english television as well, but the librarian's smile
suggested otherwise. langdon still had not gotten used to these moments of unexpected celebrity.
then again, if anyone on earth were going to recognize his face, it would be a librarian in a
religious studies reference facility.

"we need to refine the parameters further," gettum said, stopping the search. "is this all the
information you have regarding the tomb? there's nothing else to go on?"

langdon glanced at sophie neveu, looking uncertain.

this is no scavenger hunt, gettum sensed. she had heard the whisperings of robert langdon's
experience in rome last year. this american had been granted access to the most secure library on
earth — the vatican secret archives. she wondered what kinds of secrets langdon might have
learned inside and if his current desperate hunt for a mysterious london tomb might relate to
information he had gained within the vatican. gettum had been a librarian long enough to know
the most common reason people came to london to look for knights. the grail.

gettum smiled and adjusted her glasses.

sealed his own fate. the teacher had feared all along that remy might need to be eliminated when
the mission was complete, but by brazenly showing himself in the temple church, remy had
accelerated the necessity dramatically. robert langdon's unexpected visit to chateau villette had
brought the teacher both a fortuitous windfall and an intricate dilemma. langdon had delivered the
keystone directly to the heart of the operation, which was a pleasant surprise, and yet he had
brought the police on his tail. remy's prints were all over chateau villette, as well as in the barn's

abbey is considered neither cathedral nor parish church. it bears the classification of royal
peculiar, subject only to the sovereign. since hosting the coronation of william the conqueror on
christmas day in 1066, the dazzling sanctuary has witnessed an endless procession of royal
ceremonies and affairs of state — from the canonization of edward the confessor, to the marriage of
prince andrew and sarah ferguson, to the funerals of henry v, queen elizabeth i, and lady
diana.

even so, robert langdon currently felt no interest in any of the abbey's ancient history, save one
event — the funeral of the british knight sir isaac newton.

in london lies a knight a pope interred.

hurrying through the grand portico on the north transept, langdon and sophie were met by guards
who politely ushered them through the abbey's newest addition — a large walk-through metal
detector — now present in most historic buildings in london. they both passed through without

phie felt only incredulity. "how could you possibly believe that we would help you?"



"because, my dear, you are the reason the priory failed to release the documents. your
grandfather's love for you prevented him from challenging the church. his fear of reprisal against
his only remaining family crippled him. he never had a chance to explain the truth because you
rejected him, tying his hands, making him wait. now you owe the world the truth. you owe it to
the memory of your grandfather."



robert langdon had given up trying to get his bearings. despite the torrent of questions running
through his mind, he knew only one thing mattered now — getting sophie out of here alive. all the
guilt langdon had mistakenly felt earlier for involving teabing had now been transferred to
sophie.

despite teabing's pleas for cooperation and trust, his gun remained trained on sophie as langdon
stepped forward and accepted the cold marble cylinder. the vinegar inside gurgled as langdon
grasped it and stepped backward. the dials were still in random order, and the cryptex remained
locked.

langdon eyed teabing. "how do you know i won't smash it right now?"

teabing's laugh was an eerie chortle. "i should have realized your threat to break it in the temple
church was an empty one. robert langdon would never break the keystone. you are an historian,
robert. you are holding the key to two thousand years of history — the lost key to the sangreal.

silas's soul thundered with remorse and rage. "father, if it takes my lifetime, i will find the one

robert langdon stood beneath the lofty cupola of the deserted chapter house and stared into the



barrel of leigh teabing's gun.

robert, are you with me, or against me? the royal historian's words echoed in the silence of
langdon's mind.

there was no viable response, langdon knew. answer yes, and he would be selling out sophie.
answer no, and teabing would have no choice but to kill them both.

langdon's years in the classroom had not imbued him with any skills relevant to handling
confrontations at gunpoi

sauniere fell silent.

"monsieur sauniere, i would never have phoned you directly except this man made a comment
which makes me now fear for your safety." he paused. "the man also mentioned your
granddaughter, sophie."

the mention of sophie's name had been the catalyst. the curator leapt into action. he ordered silas
to come see him immediately in the safest location sauniere knew — his louvre office. then he
phoned sophie to warn her she might be in danger. drinks with robert langdon were instantly
abandoned.

now, with langdon separated from sophie on the far side of the room, teabing sensed he had
successfully alienated the two companions from one another. sophie neveu remained defiant, but
langdon clearly saw the larger picture. he was trying to figure out the password. he understands
the importance of finding the grail and releasing her from bondage.

"he won't open it for you," sophie said coldly. "even if he can."

teabing was glancing at langdon as he held the gun on

know where on the tomb to look?"

the falter in langdon's eyes was fleeting but leigh caught it. there was a lie there. a desperate,



pathetic ploy to save sophie. teabing felt a profound disappointment in robert langdon.

langdon and neveu were nothing but a threat to teabing now... and to the grail. as painful as the
solution was going to be, he knew he could carry it out with a clean conscience. the only challenge
would be to persuade langdon to set down the keystone so teabing could safely end this charade.

"a show of faith," teabing said, lowering the gun from sophie. "set down the keystone, and we'll

fache's dark eyes studied him a long moment. "a virtuous gesture, my lord. i will see to it your
wishes are carried out. "

a heavy silence fell between them.

on the television, a lean french police officer was giving a press conference in front of a sprawling
mansion. fache saw who it was and turned his attention to the screen.

"lieutenant collet," a bbc reporter said, her voice accusing. "last night, your captain publicly
charged two innocent people with murder. will robert langdon and sophie neveu be seeking
accountability from your department? will this cost captain fache his job?"

lieutenant collet's smile was tired but calm. "it is my experience that captain bezu fache seldom
makes mistakes. i have not yet spoken to him on this matter, but knowing how he operates, i
suspect his public manhunt for agent neveu and mr. langdon was part of a ruse to lure out the
real killer. "

the reporters exchanged surprised looks.

collet continued. "whether or not mr. langdon and ag

the chapel's geographic coordinates fall precisely on the north-south meridian that runs through
glastonbury. this longitudinal rose line is the traditional marker of king arthur's isle of avalon
and is considered the central pillar of britain's sacred geometry. it is from this hallowed rose line
that rosslyn — originally spelled roslin — takes its name.

rosslyn's rugged spires were casting long evening shadows as robert langdon and sophie neveu
pulled their rental car into the grassy parking area at the foot of the bluff on which the chapel stood.
their short flight from london to edinburgh had been restful, although neither of them had slept
for the anticipation of what lay ahead. gazing up at the stark edifice framed against a cloud-swept
sky, langdon felt like alice falling headlong into the rabbit hole. this must be a dream. and yet he
knew the text of sauniere's final message could not have been more specific.

hie nodded, standing. she did not know the young man's face, but as they
embraced, she could feel the power of the blood coursing through his veins... the blood she now
understood they shared.



when langdon walked across the lawn to join them, sophie could not imagine that only yesterday
she had felt so alone in the world. and now, somehow, in this foreign place, in the company of
three people she barely knew, she felt at last that she was home.

night had fallen over rosslyn.

robert langdon stood alone on the porch of the fieldstone house enjoying the sounds of laughter
and reunion drifting through the screened door behind him. the mug of potent brazilian coffee in
his hand had granted him a hazy reprieve from his mounting exhaustion, and yet he sensed the
reprieve would be fleeting. the fatigue in his body went to the core.

"i would love nothing more than to meet you in florence, robert. but on one condition." her tone
turned serious. "no museums, no churches, no tombs, no art, no relics."

"in florence? for a week? there's nothing else to do."

sophie leaned forward and kissed him again, now on the lips. their bodies came together, softly at
first, and then completely. when she pulled away, her eyes were full of promise.

"right," langdon managed. "it's a date."



epilogue

robert langdon awoke with a start. he had been dreaming. the bathrobe beside his bed bore the
monogram hotel ritz paris. he saw a dim light filtering through the blinds. is it dusk or
dawn ? he wondered.

langdon's body felt warm and deeply contented. he had slept the better part of the last two days.
sitting up slowly in bed, he now realized what had awoken him... the strangest thought. for days
he had been trying to sort through a barrage of information, but now langdon found himself fixed

she rests at last beneath the starry skies.



like the murmurs of spirits in the darkness, forgotten words echoed. the quest for the holy grail
is the quest to kneel before the bones of mary magdalene. a journey to pray at the feet of the
outcast one.

with a sudden upwelling of reverence, robert langdon fell to his knees.

for a moment, he thought he heard a woman's voice... the wisdom of the ages... whispering up
from the chasms of the earth.
