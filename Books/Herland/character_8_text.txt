 in the lot,” i said.

“but they are interesting--i like them,” jeff objected, “and i’m sure
they are educational.”

“i’m sick and tired of being educated,” terry protested. “fancy going to
a dame school--at our age. i want to get out!”

but we could not get out, and we were being educated swiftly. our
special tutors rose rapidly in our esteem. they seemed of rather finer
quality than the guards, though all were on terms of easy friendliness.
mine was named somel, jeff’s zava, and terry’s moadine. we tried to
generalize from the names, those of the guards, and of our three girls,
but got nowhere.

“they sound well enough, and they’re mostly short, but there’s no
similarity of termination--and no two alike. however, our acquaintance
is limited as yet.”

there were many things we meant to ask--as soon as we could talk well
enough. better teaching i never saw. from morning to night there was
somel, always on call except between two and four; always pleasant w

a steady friendly kindness that i grew to enjoy very much. jeff said
miss zava--he would put on a title, though they apparently had none--was
a darling, that she reminded him of his aunt esther at home; but terry
refused to be won, and rather jeered at his own companion, when we were
alone.

“i’m sick of it!” he protested. “sick of the whole thing. here we are
cooped up as helpless as a bunch of three-year-old orphans, and being
taught what they think is necessary--whether we like it or not. confound
their old-maid impudence!”

nevertheless we were taught. they

--but there are no fathers. we thought you would ask
about that long ago--why have you not?” her look was as frankly kind as
always, her tone quite simple.

terry explained that we had not felt sufficiently used to the language,
making rather a mess of it, i thought, but jeff was franker.

“will you excuse us all,” he said, “if we admit that we find it hard to
believe? there is no such--possibility--in the rest of the world.”

“have you no kind of life where it is possible?” asked zava.

“why, yes--some low forms, of course.”

“how low--or how high, rather?”

“well--there are some rather high forms of insect life in which it
occurs. parthenogenesis, we call it--that means virgin birth.”

she could not follow him.

“birth, we know, of course; but what is virgin?”

terry looked uncomfortable, but jeff met the question quite calmly.
“among mating animals, the term virgin is applied to the female who has
not mated,” he answered.

“oh, i see. and does it appl

usand years. and we want to know about your
women.”

what she said about our importance gave instant pleasure to terry. i
could see by the way he lifted his head that it pleased him. but when
she spoke of our women--someway i had a queer little indescribable
feeling, not like any feeling i ever had before when “women” were
mentioned.

“will you tell us how it came about?” jeff pursued. “you said ‘for two
thousand years’--did you have men here before that?”

“yes,” answered zava.

they were all quiet for a little.

“you should have our full history to read--do not be alarmed--it has
been made clear and short. it took us a long time to learn how to write
history. oh, how i should love to read yours!”

she turned with flashing eager eyes, looking from one to the other of
us.

“it would be so wonderful--would it not? to compare the history of two
thousand years, to see what the differences are--between us, who are
only mothers, and you, who are mothers and fathers,

.

“oh, no--truly! you see, it is many centuries that we have been breeding
the kind of cats we wanted. they are healthy and happy and friendly, as
you see. how do you manage with your dogs? do you keep them in pairs, or
segregate the fathers, or what?”

then we explained that--well, that it wasn’t a question of fathers
exactly; that nobody wanted a--a mother dog; that, well, that
practically all our dogs were males--there was only a very small
percentage of females allowed to live.

then zava, observing terry with her grave sweet smile, quoted back at
him: “rather hard on thomas, isn’t it? do they enjoy it--living without
mates? are your dogs as uniformly healthy and sweet-tempered as our
cats?”

jeff laughed, eyeing terry mischievously. as a matter of fact we began
to feel jeff something of a traitor--he so often flopped over and took
their side of things; also his medical knowledge gave him a different
point of view somehow.

“i’m sorry to admit,” he told them, “that

but they made notes; moadine read them to us.

“please tell me if i have the facts correct,” she said. “in your
country--and in others too?”

“yes,” we admitted, “in most civilized countries.”

“in most civilized countries a kind of animal is kept which is no longer
useful--”

“they are a protection,” terry insisted. “they bark if burglars try to
get in.”

then she made notes of “burglars” and went on: “because of the love
which people bear to this animal.”

zava interrupted here. “is it the men or the women who love this animal
so much?”

“both!” insisted terry.

“equally?” she inquired.

and jeff said, “nonsense, terry--you know men like dogs better than
women do--as a whole.”

“because they love it so much--especially men. this animal is kept shut
up, or chained.”

“why?” suddenly asked somel. “we keep our father cats shut up because
we do not want too much fathering; but they are not chained--they have
large grounds to run

 two of you--the two sexes--to
love and help one another. it must be a rich and wonderful world. tell
us--what is the work of the world, that men do--which we have not here?”

“oh, everything,” terry said grandly. “the men do everything, with us.”
 he squared his broad shoulders and lifted his chest. “we do not allow
our women to work. women are loved--idolized--honored--kept in the home
to care for the children.”

“what is ‘the home’?” asked somel a little wistfully.

but zava begged: “tell me first, do no women work, really?”

“why, yes,” terry admitted. “some have to, of the poorer sort.”

“about how many--in your country?”

“about seven or eight million,” said jeff, as mischievous as ever.




chapter 6. comparisons are odious


i had always been proud of my country, of course. everyone is. compared
with the other lands and other races i knew, the united states of
america had always seemed to me, speaking modestly, as good as the best
of them.

or the proportion of adult
women, and found that there were but twenty million or so at the
outside.

“then at least a third of your women are--what is it you call them--wage
earners? and they are all poor. what is poor, exactly?”

“ours is the best country in the world as to poverty,” terry told them.
“we do not have the wretched paupers and beggars of the older countries,
i assure you. why, european visitors tell us, we don’t know what poverty
is.”

“neither do we,” answered zava. “won’t you tell us?”

terry put it up to me, saying i was the sociologist, and i explained
that the laws of nature require a struggle for existence, and that in
the struggle the fittest survive, and the unfit perish. in our economic
struggle, i continued, there was always plenty of opportunity for the
fittest to reach the top, which they did, in great numbers, particularly
in our country; that where there was severe economic pressure the lowest
classes of course felt it the worst, and th

gravely. “and two-thirds are the ones who are--how was it you so
beautifully put it?--‘loved, honored, kept in the home to care for the
children.’ this inferior one-third have no children, i suppose?”

jeff--he was getting as bad as they were--solemnly replied that, on the
contrary, the poorer they were, the more children they had. that too, he
explained, was a law of nature: “reproduction is in inverse proportion
to individuation.”

“these ‘laws of nature,’” zava gently asked, “are they all the laws you
have?”

“i should say not!” protested terry. “we have systems of law that go
back thousands and thousands of years--just as you do, no doubt,” he
finished politely.

“oh no,” moadine told him. “we have no laws over a hundred years old,
and most of them are under twenty. in a few weeks more,” she continued,
“we are going to have the pleasure of showing you over our little land
and explaining everything you care to know about. we want

of our advance is always considered in its effect
on them--on the race. you see, we are mothers,” she repeated, as if in
that she had said it all.

“i don’t see how that fact--which is shared by all women--constitutes
any risk to us,” terry persisted. “you mean they would defend their
children from attack. of course. any mothers would. but we are not
savages, my dear lady; we are not going to hurt any mother’s child.”

they looked at one another and shook their heads a little, but
zava turned to jeff and urged him to make us see--said he seemed to
understand more fully than we did. and he tried.

i can see it now, or at least much more of it, but it has taken me a
long time, and a good deal of honest intellectual effort.

what they call motherhood was like this:

they began with a really high degree of social development, something
like that of ancient egypt or greece. then they suffered the loss of
everything masculine, and supposed at first that all human power and
safety h

 and were so
placed as at once to strengthen the garment and add decorative lines of
stitching.

in this, as in so many other points we had now to observe, there was
shown the action of a practical intelligence, coupled with fine artistic
feeling, and, apparently, untrammeled by any injurious influences.

our first step of comparative freedom was a personally conducted tour of
the country. no pentagonal bodyguard now! only our special tutors,
and we got on famously with them. jeff said he loved zava like an
aunt--“only jollier than any aunt i ever saw”; somel and i were as
chummy as could be--the best of friends; but it was funny to watch terry
and moadine. she was patient with him, and courteous, but it was like
the patience and courtesy of some great man, say a skilled, experienced
diplomat, with a schoolgirl. her grave acquiescence with his most
preposterous expression of feeling; her genial laughter, not only
with, but, i often felt, at him--though impeccably polite; her

and expression.

“but surely the most important growth is in mind--and in the things we
make,” urged somel. “do you find your physical variation accompanied by
a proportionate variation in ideas, feelings, and products? or, among
people who look more alike, do you find their internal life and their
work as similar?”

we were rather doubtful on this point, and inclined to hold that there
was more chance of improvement in greater physical variation.

“it certainly should be,” zava admitted. “we have always thought it a
grave initial misfortune to have lost half our little world. perhaps
that is one reason why we have so striven for conscious improvement.”

“but acquired traits are not transmissible,” terry declared. “weissman
has proved that.”

they never disputed our absolute statements, only made notes of them.

“if that is so, then our improvement must be due either to mutation, or
solely to education,” she gravely pursued. “we certainly have improve

that jeff and i feared the worst. we tried to
caution him--much good that did. the big handsome fellow drew himself up
to his full height, lifted that great chest of his, and laughed.

“there are three separate marriages,” he said. “i won’t interfere with
yours--nor you with mine.”

so the great day came, and the countless crowds of women, and we three
bridegrooms without any supporting “best men,” or any other men to back
us up, felt strangely small as we came forward.

somel and zava and moadine were on hand; we were thankful to have them,
too--they seemed almost like relatives.

there was a splendid procession, wreathing dances, the new anthem i
spoke of, and the whole great place pulsed with feeling--the deep awe,
the sweet hope, the wondering expectation of a new miracle.

“there has been nothing like this in the country since our motherhood
began!” somel said softly to me, while we watched the symbolic marches.
“you see, it is the dawn of a new era. you don’t kn

evolt had warned us; they had been extracting the
evidence without our knowing it all this time, and now were studying
with the most devout earnestness the matter they had prepared.

the result was rather distressing to us. they first explained the matter
fully to ellador, as she was the one who purposed visiting the rest
of the world. to celis they said nothing. she must not be in any way
distressed, while the whole nation waited on her great work.

finally jeff and i were called in. somel and zava were there, and
ellador, with many others that we knew.

they had a great globe, quite fairly mapped out from the small section
maps in that compendium of ours. they had the different peoples of the
earth roughly outlined, and their status in civilization indicated.
they had charts and figures and estimates, based on the facts in that
traitorous little book and what they had learned from us.

somel explained: “we find that in all your historic period, so much
longer than ours, that with all t

i studied it awhile, thinking of the time they’d have if some of our
contagions got loose there, and concluded they were right. so i agreed.

terry was the obstacle. “indeed i won’t!” he protested. “the first
thing i’ll do is to get an expedition fixed up to force an entrance into
ma-land.”

“then,” they said quite calmly, “he must remain an absolute prisoner,
always.”

“anesthesia would be kinder,” urged moadine.

“and safer,” added zava.

“he will promise, i think,” said ellador.

and he did. with which agreement we at last left herland.
