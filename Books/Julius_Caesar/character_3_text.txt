  caesar. ha! who calls?

  caesar. who is it in the press that calls on me?
    i hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,
    cry "caesar." speak, caesar is turn'd to hear.
  soothsayer. beware the ides of march.
  caesar. what man is that?

sires;
    i'll leave you.
  cassius. brutus, i do observe you now of late;
    i have not from your eyes that gentleness
    and show of love as i was wont to have;
    you bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
    over your friend that loves you.
  brutus. cassius,
    be not deceived; if i have veil'd my look,
    i turn the trouble of my countenance
    merely upon myself. vexed i am
    of late with passions of some difference,
    conceptions only proper to myself,
    which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;
    but let not therefore my good friends be grieved-
    among which number, cassius, be you one-
    nor construe any further my neglect
    than that poor brutus with himself at war
    forgets the shows of love to other men.

  cassius. then, brutus, i have much mistook your passion,
    by means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
    thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
    tell me, good brutus, can you see your face?
  brutus. no, cassius, for the eye sees not itself
    but by reflection, by some other things.
  cassius. 'tis just,
    and it is very much lamented, brutus,
    that you have no such mirrors as will turn
    your hidden worthiness into your eye
    that you might see your shadow. i have heard
    where many of the best respect in rome,
    except immortal caesar, speaking of brutus
    and groaning underneath this age's yoke,
    have wish'd that noble brutus had his eyes.
  brutus. into what dangers would you lead me, cassius,
    that you would have me seek into myself
    for that

which is not in me?
  cassius. therefore, good brutus, be prepared to hear,
    and since you know you cannot see yourself
    so well as by reflection, i your glass
    will modestly discover to yourself
    that of yourself which you yet know not of.
    and be not jealous on me, gentle brutus;
    were i a common laugher, or did use
    to stale with ordinary oaths my love
    to every new protester, if you know
    that i do fawn on men and hug them hard
    and after scandal them, or if you know
    that i p

                                             flourish and shout.
  brutus. what means this shouting? i do fear the people
    choose caesar for their king.
  cassius. ay, do you fear it?
    then must i think you would not have it so.
  brutus. i would not, cassius, yet i love him well.
    but wherefore do you hold me here so long?
    what is it that you would impart to me?
    if it be aught toward the general good,
    set honor in one eye and death i' the other
    and i will look on both indifferently.
    for let the gods so speed me as i love
    the name of honor more than i fear death.
  cassius. i know that virtue to be in you, brutus,
    as well as i do know your outward favor.
    well, honor is the subject of my story.

ot tell what you and other men
    think of this life, but, for my single self,
    i had as lief not be as live to be
    in awe of such a thing as i myself.
    i was born free as caesar, so were you;
    we both have fed as well, and we can both
    endure the winter's cold as well as he.
    for once, upon a raw and gusty day,
    the troubled tiber chafing with her shores,
    caesar said to me, "darest thou, cassius, now
    leap in with me into this angry flood
    and swim to yonder point?" upon the word,
    accoutred as i was, i plunged in
    and bade him follow. so indeed he did.
    the torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
    with lusty sinews, throwing it aside
    and stemming it with hearts of controversy.
    but ere we could arrive the point proposed,
    caesar cried, "help me, cassius, or i sink!
    i, as aeneas our great ancestor
    did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder

    did i the tired caesar. and this man
    is now become a god, and cassius is
    a wretched creature and must bend his body
    if caesar carelessly but nod on him.
    he had a fever when he was in spain,
    and when the fit was on him i did mark
    how he did shake. 'tis true, this god did shake;
    his coward lips did from their color fly,
    and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
    did lose his luster. i did hear him groan.
    ay, and that tongue of his that bade the romans
    mark him and write his speeches in their books,

  brutus. another general shout!
    i do believe that these applauses are
    for some new honors that are heap'd on caesar.
  cassius. why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
    like a colossus, and we petty men
    walk under his huge legs and peep about
    to find ourselves dishonorable graves.
    men at some time are masters of their fates:
    the fault, dear brutus, is not in our stars,
    but in ourselves that we are underlings.
    brutus and caesar: what should be in that "caesar"?
    why should that name be sounded more than yours?
    write them together, yours is as fair a name;

s,
    i shall recount hereafter; for this present,
    i would not, so with love i might entreat you,
    be any further moved. what you have said
    i will consider; what you have to say
    i will with patience hear, and find a time
    both meet to hear and answer such high things.
    till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:
    brutus had rather be a villager
    than to repute himself a son of rome
    under these hard conditions as this time
    is like to lay upon us.
  cassius. i am glad that my weak words
    have struck but thus much show of fire from brutus.

            re-enter caesar and his train.

  brutus. the games are done, and caesar is returning.
  cassius. as they pass by, pluck casca by the sleeve,
    and he will, after his sour fashion, tell you
    what hath proceeded worthy note today.
  brutus. i will do so. but, look you, cassius,
    the angry spot doth glow on caesar's brow,
    and all the rest look like a chidden train:

    as we have seen him in the capitol,
    being cross'd in conference by some senators.
  cassius. casca will tell us what the matter is.
  caesar. antonio!
  antony. caesar?
  caesar. let me have men about me that are fat,
    sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o' nights:
    yond cassius has a lean and hungry look;
    he thinks too much; such men are dangerous.
  antony. fear him not, caesar; he's not dangerous;
    he is a noble roman and well given.
  caesar. would he were fatter! but i fear him not,
    yet if my name were liable to fear,
    i do not know the man i should avoid
    so soon as that spare cassius. he reads much,
    he is a great observer, and he looks
    quite through the deeds of men. he loves no plays,
    as thou dost, antony; he hears no musi

t casca.
  casca. you pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
  brutus. ay, casca, tell us what hath chanced today
    that caesar looks so sad.
  casca. why, you were with him, were you not?
  brutus. i should not then ask casca what had chanced.
  casca. why, there was a crown offered him, and being offered
him,
     he put it by with the back of his hand, thus, and then the
     people fell ashouting.
  brutus. what was the second noise for?
  casca. why, for that too.
  cassius. they shouted thrice. what was the last cry for?
  casca. why, for that too.
  brutus. was the crown offered him thrice?
  casca. ay, marry, wast, and he put it by thrice, every time
gentler
    than other, and at every putting by mine honest neighbors
    shouted.
  cassius. who offered him the crown?
  casca. why, antony.
  brutus. tell us the manner of it, gentle casca.
  casca. i can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it. it was
    mere foolery; i did not mark it. i saw mar

 to lay his fingers off it. and then he offered
it
    the third time; he put it the third time by; and still as he
    refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped
hands
    and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal
of
    stinking breath because caesar refused the crown that it had
    almost choked caesar, for he swounded and fell down at it.
and
    for mine own part, i durst not laugh for fear of opening my
lips
    and receiving the bad air.
  cassius. but, soft, i pray you, what, did caesars wound?
  casca. he fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and
was
    speechless.
  brutus. 'tis very like. he hath the falling sickness.
  cassius. no, caesar hath it not, but you, and i,
    and honest casca, we have the falling sickness.
  casca. i know not what you mean by that, but i am sure caesar
fell
    down. if the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him
    according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to

 might go to hell among the rogues. and so he fell. when he
came
    to himself again, he said, if he had done or said anything
amiss,
    he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity.
three or
    four wenches where i stood cried, "alas, good soul!" and
forgave
    him with all their hearts. but there's no heed to be taken of
    them; if caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have
done
    no less.
  brutus. and after that he came, thus sad, away?
  casca. ay.
  cassius. did cicero say anything?
  casca. ay, he spoke greek.
  cassius. to what effect?
  casca. nay, an i tell you that, i'll ne'er look you i' the face
    again; but those that understood him smiled at one another
and
    shook their heads; but for mine own part, it was greek to me.
i
    could tell you more news too: marullus and flavius, for
pulling
    scarfs off caesar's images, are put to silence. fare you
well.
    there was more foolery yet, if could remember it.

l you sup with me tonight, casca?
  casca. no, i am promised forth.
  cassius. will you dine with me tomorrow?
  casca. ay, if i be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner
worth
    the eating.
  cassius. good, i will expect you.
  casca. do so, farewell, both.                            exit.
  brutus. what a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
    he was quick mettle when he went to school.
  cassius. so is he now in execution
    of any bold or noble enterprise,
    however he puts on this tardy form.
    this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
    which gives men stomach to digest his words
    with better appetite.
  brutus. and so it is. for this time i will leave you.
    tomorrow, if you please to speak with me,
    i will come home to you, or, if you will,
    come home to me and i will wait for you.
  cassius. i will do so. till then, think of the world.

                                     exit brutus.
    well, brutus, thou art noble; yet, i see
    thy honorable mettle may be wrought
    from that it is disposed; therefore it is meet
    that noble minds keep ever with their likes;
    for who so firm that cannot be seduced?
    caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves brutus.
    if i were brutus now and he were cassius,
    he should not humor me. i will this night,
    in several hands, in at his windows throw,
    as if they came from several citizens,
    writings, all tending to the great opinion
    that rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely
    caesar's ambition shall be glanced at.
    and after this let caesar seat him sure;
    for we will shake him, or worse days endure.           exit.

  cicero. indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.
    but men may construe things after their fashion,
    clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
    comes caesar to the capitol tomorrow?
  casca. he doth, for he did bid antonio
    send word to you he would be there tomorrow.
  cicero. good then, casca. this disturbed sky
    is not to walk in.
  casca. farewell, cicero.                          exit cicero.

  cassius. a very pleasing night to honest men.
  casca. who ever knew the heavens menace so?
  cassius. those that have known the earth so full of faults.
    for my part, i have walk'd about the streets,
    submitting me unto the perilous night,
    and thus unbraced, casca, as you see,
    have bared my bosom to the thunderstone;
    and when the

cross blue lightning seem'd to open
    the breast of heaven, i did present myself
    even in the aim and very flash of it.
  casca. but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
    it is the part of men to fear and tremble
    when the most mighty gods by tokens send
    such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
  cassius. you are dull, casca, and those sparks of life
    that should be in a roman you do want,
    or else you use not. you look pale and gaze
    and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder
    to see the strange impatience of the heavens.
    but if you would consider the true cause
    why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,
    why birds and beasts from quality and kind,
    why old men, fools, and children calculate,
    why all these things change from their ordinance,

 find
    that heaven hath infused them with these spirits
    to make them instruments of fear and warning
    unto some monstrous state.
    now could i, casca, name to thee a man
    most like this dreadful night,
    that thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
    as doth the lion in the capitol,
    a man no mightier than thyself or me
    in personal action, yet prodigious grown
    and fearful, as these strange eruptions are.
  casca. 'tis caesar that you mean, is it not, cassius?
  cassius. let it be who it is, for romans now
    have thews and limbs like to their ancestors.
    but, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,
    and we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;
    our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.
  casca. indeed they say the senators tomorrow
    mean to establish caesar as a king,
    and he shall wear his crown by sea and land
    in every place save here in italy.
  cassius. i know where i will wear this dagger then:

    poor man! i know he would not be a wolf

    he were no lion, were not romans hinds.
    those that with haste will make a mighty fire

    what rubbish, and what offal, when it serves

    as who goes farthest.
  cassius. there's a bargain made.
    now know you, casca, i have moved already
    some certain of the noblest-minded romans
    to undergo with me an enterprise
    of honorable-dangerous consequence;
    and i do know by this, they stay for me
    in pompey's porch. for now, this fearful night,
    there is no stir or walking in the streets,
    and the complexion of the element
    in favor's like the work we have in hand,
    most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.

    and look you lay it in the praetor's chair,
    where brutus may but find it; and throw this
    in at his window; set this up with wax

    is ours already, and the man entire

    it is a creature that i teach to fight,
    to wind, to stop, to run directly on,
    his corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.
    and, in some taste, is lepidus but so:
    he must be taught, and train'd, and bid go forth;
    a barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds
    on objects, arts, and imitations,
    which, out of use and staled by other men,
    begin his fashion. do not talk of him
    but as a property. and now, octavius,
    listen great things. brutus and cassius
    are levying powers; we must straight make head;
    therefore let our alliance be combined,
    our best friends made, our means stretch'd;
    and let us presently go sit in council,
    how covert matters may be best disclosed,
    and open perils surest answered.
  octavius. let us do so, for we are at the stake,
    and bay'd about with many enemies;
    and some that smile have in their hearts, i fear,

  cassius. i do not think it good.
  brutus. your reason?

    'tis better that the enemy seek us;
    so shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,
    doing himself offense, whilst we lying still
    are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.
  brutus. good reasons must of force give place to better.
    the people 'twixt philippi and this ground

    the storm is up, and all is on the hazard.
  brutus. ho, lucilius! hark, a word with you.
  lucilius. [stands forth.] my lord?

  cassius. messala!
  messala. [stands forth.] what says my general?
  cassius. messala,
    this is my birthday, as this very day
    was cassius born. give me thy hand, messala.
    be thou my witness that, against my will,
    as pompey was, am i compell'd to set
    upon one battle all our liberties.
    you know that i held epicurus strong,
    and his opinion. now i change my mind,
    and partly credit things that do presage.
    coming from sardis, on our former ensign
    two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,
    gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands,
    who to philippi here consorted us.

    and in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites
    fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,
    as we were sickly prey. their shadows seem
    a canopy most fatal, under which
    our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.
  messala. believe not so.
  cassius. i but believe it partly,
    for i am fresh of spirit and resolved
    to meet all perils very constantly.
  brutus. even so, lucilius.
  cassius. now, most noble brutus,
    the gods today stand friendly that we may,
    lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!
    but, since the affairs of men rest still incertain,
    let's reason with the worst that may befall.
    if we do lose this battle, then is this
    the very last time we shall speak together.
    what are you then determined to do?
  brutus. even by the rule of that philosophy
    by which i did blame cato for the death
    which he did give himself- i know not ho

    but i do find it cowardly and vile,
    for fear of what might fall, so to prevent
    the time of life- arming myself with patience
    to stay the providence of some high powers
    that govern us below.
  cassius. then, if we lose this battle,
    you are contented to be led in triumph
    thorough the streets of rome?
  brutus. no, cassius, no. think not, thou noble roman,
    that ever brutus will go bound to rome;
    he bears too great a mind. but this same day
    must end that work the ides of march begun.
    and whether we shall meet again i know not.
    therefore our everlasting farewell take.
    forever, and forever, farewell, cassius!
    if we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
    if not, why then this parting was well made.
  cassius. forever and forever farewell, brutus!

  brutus. ride, ride, messala, ride, and give these bills
    unto the legions on the other side.             loud alarum.
    let them set on at once, for i perceive
    but cold demeanor in octavia's wing,
    and sudden push gives them the overthrow.

  cassius. o, look, titinius, look, the villains fly!
    myself have to mine own turn'd enemy.
    this ensign here of mine was turning back;
    i slew the coward, and did take it from him.
  titinius. o cassius, brutus gave the word too early,
    who, having some advantage on octavius,
    took it too eagerly. his soldiers fell to spoil,
    whilst we by antony are all enclosed.

    mark antony is in your tents, my lord;
    fly, therefore, noble cassius, fly far off.
  cassius. this hill is far enough. look, look, titinius:
    are those my tents where i perceive the fire?
  titinius. they are, my lord.
  cassius. titinius, if thou lovest me,
    mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him,
    till he have brought thee up to yonder troops
    and here again, that i may rest assured
    whether yond troops are friend or enemy.
  titinius. i will be here again, even with a thought.     exit.
  cassius. go, pindarus, get higher on that hill;
    my sight was ever thick; regard titinius,
    and tell me what thou notest about the field.

hill.
    this day i breathed first: time is come round,
    and where i did begin, there shall i end;
    my life is run his compass. sirrah, what news?
  pindarus. [above.] o my lord!
  cassius. what news?
  pindarus. [above.] titinius is enclosed round about
    with horsemen, that make to him on the spur;
    yet he spurs on. now they are almost on him.
    now, titinius! now some light. o, he lights too.
    he's ta'en [shout.] and, hark! they shout for joy.
  cassius. come down; behold no more.
    o, coward that i am, to live so long,
    to see my best friend ta'en before my face!
                                              pindarus descends.
    come hither, sirrah.
    in parthia did i take thee prisoner,
    and then i swore thee, saving of thy life,
    that whatsoever i did bid thee do,
    thou shouldst attempt it. come now, keep thine oath;
    now be a freeman, and with this good sword,
    that ran through caesar's bowels, search this

 bosom.
    stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;
    and when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,
    guide thou the sword. [pindarus stabs him.] caesar, thou art
      revenged,
    even with the sword that kill'd thee.                  dies.
  pindarus. so, i am free, yet would not so have been,
    durst i have done my will. o cassius!
    far from this country pindarus shall run,
    where never roman shall take note of him.              exit.

                re-enter titinius with messala.

  messala. it is but change, titinius, for octavius
    is overthrown by noble brutus' power,
    as cassius' legions are by antony.
  titinius. these tidings would well comfort cassius.
  messala. where did you leave him?
  titinius. all disconsolate,
    with pindarus his bondman, on this hill.
  messala. is not that he

that lies upon the ground?
  titinius. he lies not like the living. o my heart!
  messala. is not that he?
  titinius. no, this was he, messala,
    but cassius is no more. o setting sun,
    as in thy red rays thou dost sink to night,
    so in his red blood cassius' day is set,
    the sun of rome is set! our day is gone;
    clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!
    mistrust of my success hath done this deed.
  messala. mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
    o hateful error, melancholy's child,
    why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
    the things that are not? o error, soon conceived,
    thou never comest unto a happy birth,
    but kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!
  titinius. what, pindarus! where

art thou, pindarus?
  messala. seek him, titinius, whilst i go to meet
    the noble brutus, thrusting this report
    into his ears. i may say "thrusting" it,
    for piercing steel and darts envenomed
    shall be as welcome to the ears of brutus
    as tidings of this sight.
  titinius. hie you, messala,
    and i will seek for pindarus the while.        exit messala.
    why didst thou send me forth, brave cassius?
    did i not meet thy friends? and did not they
    put on my brows this wreath of victory,
    and bid me give it thee? didst thou not hear their shouts?
    alas, thou hast misconstrued everything!
    but, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
    thy brutus bid me give it thee, and i
    will do his bidding. brutus, come apace,
    and see how i regarded caius cassius.
    by your leave, gods, this is a roman's part.
    come, cassius' sword, and find titinius' heart.
