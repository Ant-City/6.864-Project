as my surprise when a little girl opened the door and she had your eyes set in

your face.

love, nettie


next one said,


dear celie,


i keep thinking it's too soon to look for a letter from you. and i know how busy you is with all mr. ' s children. but i

miss you so much. please write to me, soon as you have a chance. every day i think about you. every minute.

the lady you met in town is name corrine. the little girl's name is olivia. the husband's name is samuel. the little boy's
name is adam. they are sanctified religious and very good to me. they live in a nice house next to the church where
samuel preaches, and we spend a lot of time on church business. i say "we" because they always try to include me in
everything they do, so i don't feel so left out and alone.

but god, i miss you, celie. i think about the time you laid yourself down for me. i love you with all my heart.

your sister, nettie


next one say,

by now i am almost crazy. i think albert told me the tr

they have been as good as their word. and i study everything night and day.

oh, celie, there are colored people in the world who want us to know! want us to grow and see the light! they are not all
mean like pa and albert, or beaten down like ma was. corrine and samuel have a wonderful marriage. their only sorrow
in the beginning was that they could not have children. and then, they say, "god" sent them olivia and adam.

i wanted to say, "god" has sent you their sister and aunt, but i didn't. yes, their children, sent by "god" are your children,
celie. and they are being brought up in love, christian charity and awareness of god. and now "god" has sent me to
watch over them, to protect and cherish them. to lavish all the love i feel for you on them. it is a miracle, isn't it? and no
doubt impossible for you to believe.

but on the other hand, if you can believe i am in africa, and i am, you can believe anythi

these to the children of africa, they said. they were all dressed so beautifully, too, celie. i wish you could have seen them.
there is a fashion in harlem now for boys to wear something called knickers— sort of baggy pants, fitted tight just below
the knee, and for girls to wear garlands of flowers in their hair. they must be the most beautiful children alive, and adam
and olivia couldn't take their eyes off them.

then there were the dinners we were invited to, the breakfasts, lunches, and suppers. i gained five pounds just from
tasting. i was too excited to really eat.

and all the people have indoor toilets, celie. and gas or electric lights!

but i am not the mother of anybody's children, i said, and i am something.

you are not much, she said. the missionary's drudge.

it is true that i work harder here than i ever dreamed i could work, and that i sweep out the school and tidy up after
service, but i don't feel like a drudge. i was surprised that this woman, whose christian name is catherine, saw me in this
light.

she has a little girl, tashi, who plays with olivia after school. adam is the only boy who will speak to olivia at school. they
are not mean to her, it is just— what is it? because she is where they are doing "boys' things" they do not see her. but
never fear, celie, olivia has your stubbornness and clearsightedness, and she is smarter than all of them, including adam,
put together.

why can't tashi come to school? she asked me. when i told her the olinka don't believe in educating girls she said, quick

made, although the roadbuilders are from a different tribe some distance to the north and nearer the coast, and their
language is somewhat different. i don't understand it, anyway, though the people of olinka seem to. but they are clever
people about most things, and understand new things very quickly.

it is hard to believe we've been here five years. time moves slowly, but passes quickly. adam and olivia are nearly as tall
as me and doing very well in all their studies. adam has a special aptitude for figures and it worries samuel that soon he
will have nothing more to teach him in this field, having exhausted his own knowledge.

when we were in england we met missionaries who sent their children back home when it was no longer possible to
teach them in the bush. but it is hard to imagine life here without the children. they love the open feeling of the village,
and love living in hu

ts. they are excited by the hunting expertise of the men and the self-sufficiency of the women in
raising their crops. no matter how down i may be, and sometimes i get very down indeed, a hug from olivia or adam
completely restores me to the level of functioning, if nothing else. their mother and i are not as close as we once were,
but i feel more like their aunt than ever. and the three of us look more and more alike every day.

about a month ago, corrine asked me not to invite samuel to my hut unless she were present. she said it gave the
villagers the wrong idea. this was a real blow to me because i treasure his company. since corrine almost never visits me
herself i will have hardly anybody to talk

do you really think they look so much like me? i said.

you could have spit them out, she said.

maybe just living together, loving people makes them look like you, i said. you know how much some old married people
look alike.

even these women saw the resemblance the first day we came, she said.

and that's worried you all this time? i tried to laugh it off
but she just looked at me.

when did you first meet my husband? she wanted to know.

and that was when i knew what she thought. she thinks adam and olivia are my children, and that samuel is their father!
oh, celie, this thing has been gnawing away at her all these years!

i met samuel the same day i met you, corrine, i said. (i still haven't got the hang of saying "sister" all the time.) as god is
my witness, that's the truth.

bring the bible, she said.

i brought the bible, and placed my hand on it, and swore.

and her children; in a short while, they were married. almost at once she was pregnant a third time, though her mental
health was no better. every year thereafter, she was pregnant, every year she became weaker and more mentally
unstable, until, many years after she married the stranger, she died.

two years before she died she had a baby girl that she was too sick to keep. then a baby boy. these children were named
olivia and adam.

this is samuel's story, almost word for word.

the stranger who married the widow was someone samuel had run with long before he found christ. when the man
showed up at samuel's house with first olivia and then adam, samuel felt not only unable to refuse the children, but as if
god had answered his and corrine's prayers.

he never told corrine about the man or about the children's "mother" because he hadn't wanted any sadness to cloud
her happiness.

dearest celie,


every day for the past week i've been trying to get corrine to remember meeting you in town. i know if she can just recall
your face, she will believe olivia (if not adam) is your child. they think olivia looks like me, but that is only because i look
like you. olivia has your face and eyes, exactly. it amazes me that corrine didn't see the resemblance.

remember the main street of town? i asked. remember the hitching post in front of finley's dry goods store? remember
how the store smelled like peanut shells?

she says she remembers all this, but no men speaking to her.

then i remember her quilts. the olinka men make beautiful quilts which are full of animals

r sister. the years have come and gone without a single word from you. only the sky above us do
we hold in common. i look at it often as if, somehow, reflected from its immensities, i will one day find myself gazing into
your eyes. your dear, large, clean and beautiful eyes. oh, celie! my life here is nothing but work, work, work, and worry.
what girlhood i might have had passed me by. and i have nothing of my own. no man, no children, no close friend,
except for samuel. but i do have children, adam and olivia. and i do have friends, tashi and catherine. i even have a
family— this village, which has fallen on such hard times.

now the engineers have come to inspect the territory. two white men came yesterday and spent a couple of hours
strolling about the village, mainly looking at the wells. such is the innate politeness of the olinka that they rushed about
preparing food for them, though precious little is left, since many of the gardens that flourish at this time of the year have

engineers. i am a very wealthy woman, and i own the village of akwee.

we listened to most of this in more or less respectful silence. the children were very taken with young harold, though he
never said a word in our presence. he seemed fond of his grandmother and used to her, but her verbosity produced in
him a kind of soberly observant speechlessness.

he's quite different with us though, said adam, who is really a great lover of children, and could get through to any child
given half an hour. adam makes jokes, he sings, he clowns and knows games. and he has the sunniest smile, most of the
time— and great healthy african teeth.

as i write about his sunny smile i realize he's been unusually glum during this trip. interested and excited, but not really
sunny, except when he's with young harold.

i will have to ask olivia what's wrong. she is thrilled at the thought of going back to engla

was a very impatient sort. you saw it in his eyes, you could see it in the way he moved his body. he was
never still. as aunt theodosia got closer to the part about her surprise and joy over receiving this medal— which validated
her service as an exemplary missionary in the king's colony— duboyce's foot began to pat the floor rapidly and
uncontrollably. corrine and i looked at each other in alarm. clearly this man had heard this tale before and was not
prepared to endure it a second time.

madame, he said, when aunt theodosia finished her story and flashed her famous medal around the room, do you realize
king leopold cut the hands off workers who, in the opinion of his plantation overseers, did not fulfill their rubber quota?
rather than cherish that medal, madame, you should regard it as a symbol of your unwitting complicity with this despot
who worked to death and brutalized and eventually exterminated thousands and thousands of african peoples.

well, said samuel, silence struck the

 the change in us immediately. i'm afraid, my dear, we were radiant.

we love each other dearly, samuel told them, with his arm around me. we intend to marry.

but before we do, i said, i must tell you something about my life and about corrine and about someone else. and it was
then i told them about you, celie. and about their mother corrine's love of them. and about being their aunt.

but where is this other woman, your sister? asked olivia.

i explained your marriage to mr. as best i could.

adam was instantly alarmed. he is a very sensitive soul who hears what isn't said as clearly as what is.

we will go back to america soon, said samuel to reassure him, and see about her.

the children stood up with us in a simple church ceremony in london. and it was that night, after the wedding dinner,
when we were all getting ready for bed, that olivia told me what has been troubling her brother. he is missing tashi.

but he's also very angry with her, she said, because when we left, she was plan

i know, said olivia. i told her nobody in america or europe cuts off pieces of themselves. and anyway, she would have had
it when she was eleven, if she was going to have it she's too old for it now.

well, some men are circumcized, i said, but that's just the removal of a bit of skin.

tashi was happy that the initiation ceremony isn't done in europe or america, said olivia. that makes it even more
valuable to her.

i see, i said.

she and adam had an awful fight. not like any they've had before. he wasn't teasing her or chasing her around the village
or trying to tie roofleaf twigs in her hair. he was mad enough to strike her.

well, it's a good thing he didn't, i said. tashi would have jammed his head through her rug loom.

i'll be glad when we get back home, said olivia. adam isn't the only one who misses tashi.

she kissed me and her father good night. adam soon came in to do the same.

along with the sweat, and
returned, dejected, to their barracks. we went on to our building, a combination church, house and school, and began to
unpack our things.

the children... i realize i shouldn't call them children, they're grown, went in search of tashi; an hour later they returned
dumbfounded. they discovered no sign of her. catherine, her mother, is planting rubber trees some distance from the
compound, they were told. but no one had seen tashi all day.

olivia was very disappointed. adam was trying to appear unconcerned, but i noticed he was absentmindedly biting the
skin around his nails.

after two days it became clear that tashi was deliberately hiding. her friends said while we were away she'd undergone
both the facial scarification ceremony and the rite of female initiation. adam went quite gray at this news. olivia merely
stricken and more concerned than ever to find her.

it was not until sunday that we saw tashi. she'd lost a considerable amount of weight, and seemed li

stless, dull-eyed and
tired. her face was still swollen from half a dozen small, neat incisions high on each cheek. when she put out her hand to
adam he refused to take it. he just looked at her scars, turned on his heel and left.

she and olivia hugged. but it was a quiet, heavy embrace. nothing like the boisterous, giggling behavior i expect from
them.

tashi is, unfortunately, ashamed of these scars on her face, and now hardly ever raises her head. they must be painful
too because they look irritated and red.

but this is what the villagers are doing to the young women and even the men. carving their identification as a people
into their

children's faces. but the children think of scarification as backward, something from their grandparents'
generation, and often resist. so the carving is done by force, under the most appalling conditions. we provide antiseptics
and cotton and a place for the children to cry and nurse their wounds.

each day adam presses us to leave for home. he can no longer bear living as we do. there aren't even any trees near us,
just giant boulders and smaller rocks. and more and more of his companions are running away. the real reason, of
course, is he can no longer bear his conflicting feelings about tashi, who is beginning, i think, to appreciate the magnitude
of her mistake.

samuel and i are truly happy, celie. and so grateful to god that we are! we still keep a school for the littlest children;

dearest celie,


tashi and her mother have run away. they have gone to join the mbeles. samuel and the children and i were discussing it
just yesterday, and we realized we do not even know for sure the mbeles exist. all we know is that they are said to live
deep in the forest, that they welcome runaways, and that they harass the white man's plantations and plan his
destruction— or at least for his removal from their continent.

adam and olivia are heartbroken because they love tashi and miss her, and because no one who has gone to join the
mbeles ever returned. we try to keep them busy around the compound and because there is so much sickness from
malaria this season there is plenty for them to do. in plowing under the olinka's yam crop and substituting canned and
powdered goods, the planters destroyed what makes them resistant to malaria. of course they did not know this, they
only wanted to take the land for rubber, but 
 
 ___________________________
 
ds of years. left without a sufficient supply of yams, the people— what's left of
them— are sickening and dying at an alarming rate.

to tell you the truth, i fear for our own health, and especially for the children. but samuel feels we will probably be all
right, having had bouts with malaria during the first years we were here.

and how are you, dearest sister? nearly thirty years have passed without a word between us. for all i know you may be
dead. as the time nears for us to come home, adam and olivia ask endless questions about you, few of which i can
answer. sometimes i tell them tashi reminds me of you. and, because there is no one finer to them than tashi, they glow
with delight. but will you still have tashi's honest and open spirit, i wonder, when we see you again? or will years of

childbearing and abuse from mr. have destroyed it? these are thoughts i don't pursue with the children, only with

my beloved companion, samuel, who advises me not to worry, to trust in god, and

talks about this, celie. and perhaps samuel and i will found a new church
in our community that has no idols in it whatsoever, in which each person's spirit is encouraged to seek god directly, his
belief that this is possible strengthened by us as people who also believe. there is little to do here for entertainment, as
you can imagine. we read the papers and magazines from home, play any number of african games with the children.
rehearse the african children in parts of shakespeare's plays— adam was always very good as hamlet giving his to be or
not to be soliloquy. corrine had firm notions of what the children should be taught and saw to it that every good work
advertised in the papers became part of their library. they know many things, and i think will not find american society
such a shock, except for the hatred of black people, which is also very clear in all the news. but i worry about their very
african independence of opinion and outspokenness, also extreme self-centeredness. a

here? when i think of them in america i see them as much younger than they appear here. much more naive. the worst
we have had to endure here is indifference and a certain understandable shallowness in our personal

stay. and, of course, none of this has to do with color. and —

everybody laughed at me. but you know, i liked it.

well, nobody gon laugh at you now, i said. here, help me stitch in these pockets.

but i don't know how, he say.

i'll show you, i said. and i did.

now us sit sewing and talking and smoking our pipes.

guess what, i say to him, folks in africa where nettie and the children is believe white people is black peoples children.
naw, he say, like this interesting but his mind really on the slant of his next stitch.

they named adam some other name soon as he arrive. they say the white missionaries before nettie and them come
told them all about adam from the white folks point of view and what the white folks know. but they know who adam is
from they own point of view. and for a whole lot longer time ago.

and who that? mr. ast.

the first man that was white. not the first man. they say nobody so crazy they think they can say who was the first man.
but everybody notice the first white man cause he was white.

mr. frown, lo

ok at the different color thread us got. thread his needle, lick his finger, tie a knot.

they say everybody before adam was black. then one day some woman they just right away kill, come out with this
colorless baby. they thought at first it was something she ate. but then another one had one and also the women start to
have twins. so the people start to put the white babies and the twins to death. so really adam wasn't even the first white
man. he was just the first one the people didn't kill.

mr. look at me real thoughtful. he not such a bad looking man, you know, when you come right down to it. and

now it do begin to look like he got a lot of feeling hind his face.

black unless some black man been messing with 'em. and no white folks been in africa back yonder when all this ha

so these olinka people heard about adam and eve from the white missionaries and they heard about how the serpent
tricked eve and how god chased them out of the garden of eden. and they was real curious to hear this, cause after they
had chased the white olinka children out of the village they hadn't hardly thought no more about it. nettie say one thing
about africans. out of sight, out of mind. and another thing, they don't like nothing around them that look or act
different. they want everybody to be just alike. so you know somebody

 white wouldn't last long. she say seem like to her
the africans throwed out the white olinka peoples for how they look. they throwed out the rest of us, all us who become

nobody tell 'em nothing even today. can't be rule. every nigger you see got a kingdom in his head.

but guess what else, i say to mr. . when the missionaries got to the part bout adam and eve being naked, the olinka

peoples nearly bust out laughing. especially when the missionaries tried to make them put on clothes because of this.
they tried to explain to the missionaries that it was they who put adam and eve out of the village because they was
naked. their word for naked is white. but since they are covered by color they are not naked. they said anybody looking
at a white person can tell they naked, but black people can not be naked because they can not be white.

right, i said. adam and eve prove it. what they did, these olinka peoples, was throw out they own children, just cause
they was a little different.

oh, from what nettie say, them africans is a mess. and you know what the bible say, the fruit don't fall too far from the

nettie say they real good at thinking, i say. but they think so much in terms of thousands of years they have a hard time

so what they name adam?

something sound like omatangu, i say. it mean a un-naked man somewhere near the first one god made that knowed
what he was. a whole lot of the men that come before the first man was men, but none of 'em didn't know it. you know

 from you.

your sister, celie


dear celie,


after two and a half months adam and tashi returned! adam overtook tashi and her mother and some other members of
our compound as they were nearing the village where the white woman missionary had lived, but tashi would not hear of
turning back, nor would catherine, and so adam accompanied them to the mbeles encampment.

oh, he says, it is the most extraordinary place!

you know, celie, in africa there is a huge depression in the earth called the great rift valley, but it is on the other side of
the continent from where we are. however, according to adam, there is a "small" rift on our side, several thousand acres
large and even deeper than the great rift, which covers millions of acres. it is a place set so deep into the earth that it can
only really be seen, adam th
 
 ___________________________
 
inks, from the air, and then it would seem just an overgrown canyon. well, in this overgrown
canyon are a thousand people from dozens of african tribes, and even one colored man— adam swears— from alabama!
there are farms. there is a school. an infirmary. a temple. and there are male and female warriors who do indeed go on
missions of sabotage against the white plantations.

but all this seemed more a marvel in the recounting than in the actual experiencing of it, if i am any judge of adam and
tashi. their minds seem to have been completely riveted on each other.

i wish you could have seen them as they staggered into the compound. filthy as hogs, hair as wild as could be. sleepy.
exhausted. smelly. god knows. but still arguing.

just because i came back with you, don't think i am saying yes to marriage, says tashi.

oh yes you are, says adam, heatedly, but through a yawn. you promised your mother. / promised your mother.

nobody in america will like me, says tashi.

i will like 
 
 ___________________________
 
you, says adam.

olivia ran and enfolded tashi in her arms. ran about preparing food and a bath.

last night, after tashi and adam had slept most of the day, we had a family conference. we informed them that because
so many of our people had gone to join the mbeles and the planters were beginning to bring in moslem workers from the
north, and because it was time for us to do so, we would be leaving for home in a matter of weeks.

adam announced his desire to marry tashi.

tashi announced her refusal to be married.

and then, in that honest, forthright way of hers, she gave her reasons. paramount among them that, because of the
scarification marks on her cheeks americans would look down on her as a savage and shun her, and whatever children
she and adam might have. that she had seen the magazines we receive from home and that it was very clear to her that
black people did not truly admire blackskinned black people like hersel
 
 ___________________________
 
f, and especially did not admire blackskinned black
women. they bleach their faces, she said. they fry their hair. they try to look naked.

also, she continued, i fear adam will be distracted by one of these naked looking women and desert me. then i would
have no country, no people, no mother and no husband and brother.

you'd have a sister, said olivia.

then adam spoke. he asked tashi to forgive his initial stupid response to the scarification. and to forgive the repugnance
he'd felt about the female initiation ceremony. he assured tashi that it was she he loved and that in america she would
have country, people, parents, sister, husband, brother and lover, and that whatever befell her in america would also be
his own choice and his own lot.

oh, celie.

so, the next day, our boy came to us with scars identical to tashi's on his cheeks.

and they are so
 
 ___________________________
 
 happy. so happy, celie. tashi and adam omatangu.

samuel married them, of course, and all the people left in the compound came to wish them happiness and an
abundance of roofleaf forever. olivia stood up with the bride and a friend of adam's— a man too old to have joined the
mbeles — stood up with him. immediately after the wedding we left the compound, riding in a lorry that took us to a boat
at the coast inlet that flows out to sea.

in a few weeks, we will all be home.
