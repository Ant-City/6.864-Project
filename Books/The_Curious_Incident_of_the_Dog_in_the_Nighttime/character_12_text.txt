i was also wearing my watch and they wanted me to leave this at the desk as well but i said that i needed 
to keep my watch on because i needed to know exactly what time it was. and when they tried to take it 
off me i screamed, so they let me keep it on. 
 
they asked me if i had any family. i said i did. they asked me who my family was. i said it was father, 
but mother was dead. and i said it was also uncle terry, but he was in sunderland and he was father's 
brother,  and  it  was  my  grandparents,  too,  but  three  of  them  were  dead  and  grandma  burton  was  in  a 
home because she had senile dementia and thought that i was someone on television. 
 
then they asked me for father's phone number. 
 
i told them that he had two numbers, one for at home and one which was a mobile phone, and i said both 
of them.

inking of all the things i could do and deciding whether they were the right decision or 
not. 
 
i decided that i couldn't go home again. 
 
and i decided that i couldn't go and live with siobhan because she couldn't look after  me when school 
was closed because she was a teacher and not a friend or a member of my family. 
 
and  i  decided  that  i  couldn't  go  and  live  with  uncle  terry  because  he  lived  in  sunderland  and  i  didn't

my hair. 
 
and i decided i couldn't go and live with mrs. alexander because she wasn't a friend or a member of my 
family even if she had a dog, because i couldn't stay overnight in her house or use her toilet because she 
had used it and she was a stranger. 
 
and then i thought that i could go and live with mother because she was my family and i knew where she

and father finding me, and that made me feel even more frightened. and when i thought about that i felt

best time. 
 
and then it was 6:35 p.m. and i heard father come home in his van and i moved the bed up against the 
door so he couldn't get in and he came into the house and he and mother shouted at each other. 
 
and father shouted, "how the fuck did you get in here?" and mother shouted, "this is my house, too, in 
case you've forgotten." 
 
and father shouted, "is your fucking fancy man here as well?" 
 
and then i picked up the bongo drums that uncle terry had bought me and i knelt down in the corner of 
the room and i pressed my head into the join between the two walls and i banged the drums and i groaned 
and  i  carried  on  doing  this  for  an  hour  and  then  mother  came  into  the  room  and  said  father  had  gone. 
and she said father had gone to stay with rhodri for a while and we would get a place to live of our own 
in the next few weeks. 
 
then i went into the garden and i found toby's cage behind the shed and i brought it inside
