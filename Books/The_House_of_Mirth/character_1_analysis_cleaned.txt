[CHARACTER]

[CHARACTER], a young lawyer, is the only person in
the novel who is able to move within the elite social circles and
yet view them with the detached scrutiny of an outsider. not wealthy
himself, selden has a distant relationship to money, believing love
and happiness to be found instead of purchased. he is one of lily's
few consistent friends, always providing lively banter, a shoulder
to cry on, and honest advice. selden's rational thinking often overpowers
his romantic side, and it eventually causes him to realize how much
he is in love with lily--a few hours too late.
