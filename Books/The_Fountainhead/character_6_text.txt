ork. but she had remained in stanton, awaiting the day when he would be able 
to send for her. he had nowhere to go tonight, save to the respectable little boardinghouse on 
west twenty-eighth street, where he could climb three flights of stairs to his clean, airless 
little room. he had met people in new york, many people, many girls, with one of whom he 
remembered spending a pleasant night, though he could not remember her last name; but he 
wished to see none of them. and then he thought of catherine halsey.

he had sent her a wire on the night of his graduation and forgotten her ever since. now he 
wanted to see her; the desire was intense and immediate with the first sound of her name in 
his memory. he leaped into a bus for the long ride to greenwich village, climbed to the 
deserted top and, sitting alone on the front bench, cursed the traffic lights whenever they 
turned to red. it had always been like this where catherine was concerned; and he wondered 
dimly what was the matter with him.

, position and salary were given to peter keating. 
but this was only part of his satisfaction; there was another sense of it, warmer and less real--
and more dangerous. he said brightly and often: 'tim davis? oh yes, i got him his present 
job."

he wrote to his mother about it. she said to her friends: "petey is such an unselfish boy."

he wrote to her dutifully each week; his letters were short and respectful; hers, long, detailed 
and full of advice which he seldom finished reading.

he saw catherine halsey occasionally. he had not gone to her on that following evening, as 
he had promised. he had awakened in the morning and remembered the things he had said 
to her, and hated her for his having said them. but he had gone to her again, a week later; she 
had not reproached him and they had not mentioned her uncle. he saw her after that every 
month or two; he was happy when he saw her, but he never spoke to her of his career.

he tried to speak of it to howard roark; the attempt failed. he called

bewildered, blinking.

there was little to do in the office, nothing to say and everyone to avoid. keating left early and 
walked home through a cold december twilight.

at home, he cursed aloud the thick smell of paint from the overheated radiators. he cursed 
the chill, when his mother opened a window. he could find no reason for his restlessness, 
unless it was the sudden inactivity that left him alone. he could not bear to be left alone.

he snatched up the telephone receiver and called catherine halsey. the sound of her clear 
voice was like a hand pressed soothingly against his hot forehead. he said: "oh, nothing 
important, dear, i just wondered if you'd be home tonight. i thought i'd drop in after dinner."

"of course, peter. i'll be home."

"swell. about eight-thirty?"

"yes...oh, peter, have you heard about uncle ellsworth?"

"yes, god damn it, i've heard about your uncle ellsworth!...i'm sorry, katie...forgive me, 
darling, i didn't mean to be rude, but i've been hearing about your uncl

curious loafers stood indifferently in the rain around the entrance, and a 
few policemen. the door was open. the dim lobby was crowded with people who could not 
get into the packed hall, they were listening to a loud-speaker installed there for the occasion. 
at the door three vague shadows were handing out pamphlets to passers-by. one of the 
shadows was a consumptive, unshaved young man with a long, bare neck; the other was a 
trim youth with a fur collar on an expensive coat; the third was catherine halsey.

she stood in the rain, slumped, her stomach jutting forward in weariness, her nose shiny, her 
eyes bright with excitement. keating stopped, staring at her.

her hand shot toward him mechanically with a pamphlet, then she raised her eyes and saw 
him. she smiled without astonishment and said happily:

"why, peter! how sweet of you to come here!"

"katie..." he choked a little. "katie, what the hell..."

"but i had to, peter." her voice had no trace of apology. "you don't understand, but i..."

ays, new horizons. the fourth, new frontiers, survived. ellsworth toohey was the only 
thing salvaged from the successive wrecks. architectural criticism seemed to be a neglected 
field of endeavor; few people bothered to write about buildings, fewer to read. toohey 
acquired a reputation and an unofficial monopoly. the better magazines began calling upon 
him whenever they needed anything connected with architecture.

in the year 1921 a small change occurred in toohey's private life; his niece catherine halsey, 
the daughter of his sister helen, came to live with him. his father had long since died, and 
aunt adeline had vanished into the obscure poverty of some small town; at the death of 

catherine's parents there was no one else to take care of her. toohey had not intended to 
keep her in his own home. but when she stepped off the train in new york, her plain little face 
looked beautiful for a moment, as if the future were opening before her and its glow were 
already upon her forehead, as if s

"but if you have no...no self-respect, how can you be anything?"

"why must you be anything?"

she spread her hands out, bewildered.

"if your first concern is for what you are or think or feel or have or haven't got--you're still a 
common egotist."

"but i can't jump out of my own body."

"no. but you can jump out of your narrow soul."

"you mean, i must want to be unhappy?"

"no. you must stop wanting anything. you must forget how important miss catherine halsey 
is. because, you see, she isn't. men are important only in relation to other men, in their 
usefulness, in the service they render. unless you understand that completely, you can expect 
nothing but one form of misery or another. why make such a cosmic tragedy out of the fact 
that you've found yourself feeling cruel toward people? so what? it's just growing pains. one 
can't jump from a state of animal brutality into a state of spiritual living without certain 
transitions. and some of them m

warmer and their wearers' rights to them incontestable, since it established superiority and 
altruistic virtue together, in a demonstration more potent than a visit to a morgue. on the way 
back from such an inspection ellsworth toohey received humbled compliments on the 
wonderful work he was doing, and had no trouble in obtaining checks for his other 
humanitarian activities, such as publications, lecture courses, radio forums and the workshop 
of social study.

catherine halsey was put in charge of the children's occupational therapy, and she moved 
into the home as a permanent resident. she took up her work with a fierce zeal. she spoke 
about it insistently to anyone who would listen. her voice was dry and arbitrary. when she 
spoke, the movements of her mouth hid the two lines that had appeared recently, cut from her 
nostrils to her chin; people preferred her not to remove her glasses; her eyes were not good to 
see. she spoke belligerently about her work not bein
