 he ordered my wounds to be dressed, and took me to his quarters as a prisoner of war. i washed the few shirts that he had, i did his cooking; he thought me very pretty—he avowed it; on the other hand, i must own he had a good shape, and a soft and white skin; but he had little or no mind or philosophy, and you might see plainly that he had never been instructed by doctor pangloss. in three months time, having lost all his money, and being grown tired of my company, he sold me to a jew, named don issachar, who traded to holland and portugal, and had a strong passion for women. this jew was much attached to my person, but could not triumph over it; i resisted him better than the bulgarian soldier. a modest woman may be ravished once, but her virtue is strengthened by it. in order to render me more tractable, he brought me to this country house. hitherto i had imagined that nothing could equal the beauty of thunder-ten-tronckh castle; but i found i was mistaken.

ne day at mass, stared long at me, and sent to tell me that he wished to speak on private matters. i was conducted to his palace, where i acquainted him with the history of my family, and he represented to me how much it was beneath my rank[pg 32] to belong to an israelite. a proposal was then made to don issachar that he should resign me to my lord. don issachar, being the court banker, and a man of credit, would hear nothing of it. the inquisitor threatened him with an auto-da-fé. at last my jew, intimidated, concluded a bargain, by which the house and myself should belong to both in common; the jew should have for himself monday, wednesday, and saturday, and the inquisitor should have the rest of the week. it is now six months since this agreement was made. quarrels have not been wanting, for they could not decide whether the night from saturday to

"at length, to avert the scourge of earthquakes, and to intimidate don issachar, my lord inquisitor was pleased to celebrate an auto-da-fé. he did me the honour to invite me to the ceremony. i had a very good seat, and the ladies were served with refreshments between mass and the execution. i was in truth seized with horror at the burning of those two jews, and of the honest biscayner who had married his godmother; but what was my surprise, my fright, my trouble, when i saw in a san-benito and mitre a figure which resembled that[pg 33] of pangloss! i rubbed my eyes, i loo

eceive a hundred lashes, and the other to be hanged by the grand inquisitor, of whom i am the well-beloved? pangloss most cruelly deceived me when he said that everything in the world is for the best.

"agitated, lost, sometimes beside myself, and sometimes ready to die of weakness, my mind was filled with the massacre of my father, mother, and brother, with the insolence of the ugly bulgarian soldier, with the stab that he gave me, with my servitude under the bulgarian captain, with my hideous don issachar, with my abominable inquisitor, with the execution of doctor pangloss, with the grand miserere to[pg 34] which they whipped you, and especially with the kiss i gave you behind the screen the day that i had last seen you. i praised god for bringing you back to me after so many trials, and i charged my old woman to take care of you, and to conduct you hither as soon as possible. she has executed her commission perfectly well; i have tasted the inexpressible pleasure of seeing you again, of hearin

they both sat down to table, and, when supper was over, they placed themselves once more on the sofa; where they were when signor don issachar arrived. it was the jewish sabbath, and issachar had come to enjoy his rights, and to explain his tender love.[pg 35]

what became of cunegonde, candide, the grand inquisitor, and the jew.

this issachar was the most choleric hebrew that had ever been seen in israel since the captivity in babylon.

"what!" said he, "thou bitch of a galilean, was not the inquisitor enough for thee? must this rascal also share with me?"

in saying this he drew a long poniard which he always carried about him;

istence? in brief, to caress[pg 53] the serpent which devours us, till he has eaten our very heart?

"in the different countries which it has been my lot to traverse, and the numerous inns where i have been servant, i have taken notice of a vast number of people who held their own existence in abhorrence, and yet i never knew of more than eight who voluntarily put an end to their misery; three negroes, four englishmen, and a german professor named robek.[14] i ended by being servant to the jew, don issachar, who placed me near your presence, my fair lady. i am determined to share your fate, and have been much more affected with your misfortunes than with my own. i would never even have spoken to you of my misfortunes, had you not piqued me a little, and if it were not customary to tell stories on board a ship in order to pass away the time. in short, miss cunegonde, i have had experience, i know the world; therefore i advise you to divert yourself, and prevail upon each passenger to tell his story
