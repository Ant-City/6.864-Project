‘most of you, i am sure, remember the tragic circumstances of the death of geoffrey clifton at gilf kebir, followed later by 
the disappearance of his wife, katharine clifton, which took place during the 1939 desert expedition in search of zerzura. 
“i cannot begin this meeting tonight without referring very sympathetically to those tragic occurrences.

among those tribes who could understand the concept of photographs. 

the cliftons were on the last days of their honeymoon. i left them with the others and went to join a man in kufra and spent 
many days with him, trying out theories i had kept secret from the rest of the expedition. i returned to the base camp at el jof 
three nights later. 

the desert fire was between us. the cliftons, madox, bell and myself. if a  man leaned back a few inches  he  would dis-

fire.

there was classical blood in her face. her parents were famous, apparently, in the world of legal history. i am a man who did 

not enjoy poetry until i heard a woman recite it to us. 

and in that desert  she dragged her university days into our  midst  to describe the  stars—the  way  adam tenderly taught  a 

woman with gracious metaphors.

record company. 1938. 1939. there was the whispering of love in a booth. there was war around the corner. 

during those final nights in cairo, months after the affair was over, we had finally persuaded madox into a zinc bar for his 
farewell. she and her husband were there. one last night. one last dance. almasy was drunk and attempting an old dance step 
he had invented called the bosphorus hug, lifting katharine clifton into his wiry arms and traversing the floor until he fell with 
her across some nile-grown aspidistras. 

 
who is he speaking as now? caravaggio thinks. 
 
almasy was drunk and his dancing seemed to the others a brutal series of movements. in those days he and she did not seem 
to be getting on well. he swung her from side to side as if she were some anonymous doll, and smothered with drink his grief 
at madox’s leaving. he was loud at the tables with us. when almasy was like this we usually

museum during the day and frequented the south cairo market bars at night. lost in another egypt. it was only for madox they 
had all come here. but now almasy was dancing with katharine clifton. the line of plants brushed against her slimness. he 
pivoted with her, lifting her up, and then fell. clifton stayed in his seat, half watching them. almasy lying across her and then 
slowly trying to get up, smoothing back his blond hair, kneeling over her in the far corner of the room. he had at one time been 
a man of delicacy. 

it  was  past  midnight.  the  guests  there  were  not  amused,  except  for  the  easily  amused  regulars,  accustomed  to  these

knows first he must get out of this desert, its architecture of morphine. he needs to pull away from the invisible road to el taj. 
this man he believes to be almasy has used him and the morphine to return to his own world, for his own sadness. it no longer 
matters which side he was on during the war. 

but caravaggio leans forward. 
“i need to know something.” 
“what?” 
“i need to know if you murdered katharine clifton. that is, if you murdered clifton, and in so doing killed her.” 
“no. i never even imagined that.”

“the reason i ask is that geoffrey clifton  was  with british intelligence. he  was  not just an innocent englishman,  i’m 

afraid. your friendly boy. as far as the english were concerned, he was keeping an eye on your strange group in the egyptian-
libyan desert. they knew the desert would someday be a theatre of war. he was an aerial photographer. his death perturbed

,” almasy murmured. 
“do you want morphine?” 
“no. i’m putting things into place. i was always a private man. it is difficult to realize i was so discussed.” 
“you were having an affair with someone connected with intelligence. there were some people in intelligence who knew 

you personally.” 

“bagnold probably.” 
“yes.” 
“very english englishman.” 
“yes.” 
caravaggio paused. 
“i have to talk to you about one last thing.” 
“i know.” 
“what happened to katharine clifton? what happened just before the war to make you all come to the gilf kebir again? 

after madox left for england.” 

 
i was supposed to make one more journey to the gilf kebir, to pack up the last of the base camp at uweinat. our life there 
was  over.  i  thought  nothing  more  would  happen  between  us.  i  had  not  met  her  as  a  lover  for  almost  a  year.  a  war  was 
preparing itself somewhere like a hand entering an attic window. and she and i had already retreated behind our ow

sdom, characters we have climbed into as if trees, fears we have 
hidden  in  as  if  caves.  i  wish  for  all  this  to  be  marked  on  my  body  when  i  am  dead.  i  believe  in  such  cartography—  to  be 
marked by nature, not just to label ourselves on a map like the names of rich men and women on buildings. we are communal 
histories, communal books. we are not owned or monogamous in our taste or experience. all i desired was to walk upon such 
an earth that had no maps. 

i carried katharine clifton into the desert, where there is the communal book of moonlight. we were among the rumour of 

wells. in the palace of winds. 

 
almasy’s face fell to the left, staring at nothing—caravag-gio’s knees perhaps. 
“do you want some morphine now?” 
“no.” 
“can i get you something?” 
“nothing.”
