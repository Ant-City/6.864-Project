Old Man - 
      Eddie's and May's father. The Old Man appears only in the minds of May and Eddie. Martin does not hear or see him, adding to the dream-like qualities of the play. His surreal contributions to the play add an outsider's commentary with the perspective of an insider. He is the father of May and Eddie and yet he had so little to do with raising them he is a stranger. The Old Man was with Eddie's mother for most of Eddie's childhood and simultaneously was having a secret relationship with May's mother in another town. He lived a double life that became revealed when Eddie and May were teenagers. The Old Man's presence in the play highlights the recurring themes of dual relationships, reality vs. illusion, lies vs. truth and the way stories and memories mutate and change as different people remember the same event. Through Shepard's inclusion of the Old Man, we see the extent one person's selfish decisions can affect other people's lives for years to come and the way history may repeat itself or stop a pattern in abusive relationships and in families.
