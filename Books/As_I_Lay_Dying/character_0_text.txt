when i reach the top he has quit sawing. standing in a litter of chips, he 

is fitting two of the boards together. between the shadow spaces they are yellow 

as gold, like soft gold, bearing on their flanks in smooth undulations the marks 

of the adze blade: a good carpenter, cash is. he holds the two planks on the 

trestle, fitted along the edges in a quarter of the finished box. he kneels and 

squints along the edge of them, then he lowers them and takes up the adze. a 

good carpenter. addie bundren could not want a better one, better box to lie in. 

it will give her confidence and comfort. i go on to the house, followed by the

of the adze.

so i saved out the eggs and baked yesterday. the cakes turned out right well. we 
depend a lot on our chickens. they are good layers, what few we have left after 
the possums and such. snakes too, in the summer. a snake will break up a henhouse 
quicker than anything. so after they were going to cost so much more tha

grace is not upon her. 

"they turned out real nice," i say. "but not like the cakes addie used to 
bake." you can see that girl's washing and ironing in the pillow-slip, if ironed 
it ever was. maybe it will reveal her blindness to her, laying there at the 
mercy and the ministration of four men and a torn-boy girl. "there's not a woman 
in this section could ever bake with addie bundren," i say. "first thing we know 
she'll be up and baking again, and then we wont have any sale for ours at all." 
under the quilt she makes no more of a hump than a rail would, and the only way 
you can tell she is breathing is by the sound of the mattress shucks. even the 
hair, at her cheek does not move, even with that girl standing right over her, 
fanning her with the fan. while we watch she swaps the fan to the other hand 



without stopping it.

"well, folks are different," he said. 

i should hope so. i have tried to live right in the sight of god and man, 
for the honor and comfort of my christian husband and the love and respect of my 
christian children. so that when i lay me down in the consciousness of my duty 
and reward i will be surrounded by loving faces, carrying the farewell kiss of 
each of my loved ones into my reward. not like addie bundren dying alone, hiding 
her pride and her broken heart. glad to go. lying there with her head propped up 
so she could watch cash building the coffin, having to watch him so he would not 
skimp on it, like as not, with those men not worrying about anything except if 
there was time to earn another three dollars before the rain come and the river 
got too high to get across it. like as not, if they hadn't decided to make that 
last load, they would have loaded her into the wagon on a quilt and cros

have such bad luck: is that it?" 

the sun, an hour above the horizon, is poised like a bloody egg upon a 
crest of thunderheads; the light has turned copper: in the eye portentous, in 
the nose sulphurous, smelling of lightning. when peabody comes, they will have 
to use the rope. he has pussel-gutted himself eating cold greens. with the rope 
they will haul him up the path, balloon-like up the sulphurous air. 
"jewel," i say, "do you know that addie bundren is going to die? addie 
bundren is going to die?" 

peabody 

when anse finally sent for me of his own accord, i said "he has wore her out at 
last." and i said a damn good thing, and at first i would not go because there 
might be something i could do and i would have to haul her back, by god. i 
thought maybe they have the same sort of fool ethics in heaven they have in the 
medical college and that it was maybe vernon lull sending for me again, getting

"ma," dewey dell says; "ma!" leaning above the bed, her hands lifted a 
little, the fan still moving like it has for ten days, she begins to keen. her 
voice is strong, young, tremulous and clear, rapt with its own timbre and 
volume, the fan still moving steadily up and down, whispering the useless air. 
then she flings herself across addle bundren's knees, clutching her, shaking her 
with the furious strength of the young before sprawling suddenly across the 
handful of rotten bones that addie bundren left, jarring the whole bed into a 
chattering sibilance of mattress shucks, her arms outflung and the fan in one 
hand still beating with expiring breath into the quilt. 
from behind pa's leg vardaman peers, his mouth full open and all color 
draining from his face into his mouth, as though he has by some means fleshed 
his own teeth in himself, sucking. he begins to move slowly backward from the 
bed, his eyes round, his pale face fading into the dusk like a piece of paper 
pasted on a failin

in, palm and back, on his thigh. the sound of the saw snores 
steadily into the room. pa breathes with a quiet, rasping sound, mouthing the 
snuff against his gums. "god's will be done," he says. "now i can get them 
teeth." 

jewel's hat droops limp about his neck, channelling water onto the soaked 
towsack tied about his shoulders as, ankle-deep in the running ditch, he pries 
with a slipping two-by-four, with a piece of rotting log for fulcrum, at the 
axle. jewel, i say, she is dead, jewel. addie bundren is dead

then i begin to run. i run toward the back and come to the edge of the porch and 
stop. then i begin to cry. i can feel where the fish was in the dust. it is cut 
up into pieces of not-fish now, not-blood on my hands and overalls. then it 
wasn't so. it hadn't happened then. and now she is getting so far ahead i cannot 
catch her. 

the trees look like chickens when they ruffle out into the cool dust on 
the hot days. if i jump off the porch i will be where the fish was, an

it was nigh to midnight and it had set into rain when he woke us. it had been a 
misdoubtful night, with the storm making; a night when a fellow looks for most 
anything to happen before he can get the stock fed and himself to the house and 
supper et and in bed with the rain starting, and when peabody's team come up, 
lathered, with the broke harness dragging and the neck-yoke betwixt the off 
critter's legs, cora says "it's addie bundren. she's gone at last." 
"peabody mought have been to ere a one of a dozen houses hereabouts," i 
says. "besides, how do you know it's peabody's team?" 
"well, aint it?" she says. "you hitch up, now." 

"what for?" i says. "if she is gone, we cant do nothing till morning. and 
it fixing to storm, too." 

"it's my duty," she says. "you put the team in." 



but i wouldn't do it. "it stands to reason they'd send for us if they 

needed us. you dont even know she's gone yet." 

"why, dont you know t

 he is what he is not. beyond the unlamped wall i can hear 
the rain shaping the wagon that is ours, the load that is no longer theirs that 
felled and sawed it nor yet theirs that bought it and which is not ours either, 
lie on our wagon though it does, since only the wind and the rain shape it only 
to jewel and me, that are not asleep. and since sleep is is-not and rain and 
wind are was, it is not. yet the wagon is, because when the wagon is was, addie 
bundren will not be. and jewel is, so addie bundren must be. and then i must be, 
or i could not empty myself for sleep in a strange room. and so if i am not 
emptied yet, i am is. 

how often have i lain beneath rain on a strange roof, thinking of home.

his jaws still chewing. but he swore he was all right. 
it was ma that got dewey dell to do his milking, paid her somehow, and the 
other jobs around the house that jewel had been doing before supper she found 
some way for dewey dell and vardaman to do them. and doing them herself when pa 
wasn't there. she would fix him special things to eat and hide them for him. and 
that may have been when i first found it out, that addie bundren should be 
hiding anything she did, who had tried to teach us that deceit was such that, in 
a world where it was, nothing else could be very bad or very important, not even 
poverty. and at times when i went in to go to bed she would be sitting in the 
dark by jewel where he was asleep. and i knew that she was hating herself for 
that deceit and hating jewel because she had to love him so that she had to act 
the deceit.

beads, and i can see his mouth shape as he calls my name. 
"jewel!" dewey dell cries; "jewel!" it seems to me that i now hear the 



accumulation of her voice through the last five minutes, and i hear her 
scuffling and struggling as pa and mack hold her, screaming "jewell jewel!" but 
he is no longer looking at us. we see his shoulders strain as he upends the 
coffin and slides it single-handed from the sawhorses. it looms unbelievably 
tall, hiding him: i would not have believed that addie bundren would have needed 
that much room to lie comfortable in; for another instant it stands upright 
while the sparks rain on it in scattering bursts as though they engendered other 
sparks from the contact. then it topples forward, gaining momentum, revealing 
jewel and the sparks raining on him too in engendering gusts, so that he appears 
to be enclosed in a thin nimbus of fire. without stopping it overends and rears 
again, pauses, then crashes slowly forward and through the curtain. this time
