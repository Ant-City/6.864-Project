Banquo - 
                The
brave, noble general whose children, according to the witches' prophecy,
will inherit the Scottish throne. Like Macbeth, Banquo thinks ambitious
thoughts, but he does not translate those thoughts into action.
In a sense, Banquo's character stands as a rebuke to Macbeth, since
he represents the path Macbeth chose not to take: a path in which
ambition need not lead to betrayal and murder. Appropriately, then,
it is Banquo's ghost--and not Duncan's--that haunts Macbeth. In addition
to embodying Macbeth's guilt for killing Banquo, the ghost also
reminds Macbeth that he did not emulate Banquo's reaction to the
witches' prophecy.
