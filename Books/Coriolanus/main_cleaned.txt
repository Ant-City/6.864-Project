the tragedie of coriolanus

actus primus. scoena prima.


enter a company of mutinous citizens, with staues, clubs, and
other
weapons.

  1. citizen. before we proceed any further, heare me speake

   all. speake, speake

   1.cit. you are all resolu'd rather to dy then
to famish?
  all. resolu'd, resolu'd

   1.cit. first you know, caius martius is chiefe enemy
to the people

   all. we know't, we know't

   1.cit. let vs kill him, and wee'l haue corne at our own
price. is't a verdict?
  all. no more talking on't; let it be done, away, away
  2.cit. one word, good citizens

   1.cit. we are accounted poore citizens, the patricians
good: what authority surfets one, would releeue
vs. if they would yeelde vs but the superfluitie while it
were wholsome, wee might guesse they releeued vs humanely:
but they thinke we are too deere, the leannesse
that afflicts vs, the obiect of our misery, is as an inuentory
to particularize their abundance, our sufferance is a
gaine to them. let vs reuenge this with our pikes, ere
we become rakes. for the gods know, i speake this in
hunger for bread, not in thirst for reuenge

   2.cit. would you proceede especially against caius
martius

   all. against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty

   2.cit. consider you what seruices he ha's done for his
country?
  1.cit. very well, and could bee content to giue him
good report for't, but that hee payes himselfe with beeing
proud

   all. nay, but speak not maliciously

   1.cit. i say vnto you, what he hath done famouslie,
he did it to that end: though soft conscienc'd men can be
content to say it was for his countrey, he did it to please
his mother, and to be partly proud, which he is, euen to
the altitude of his vertue

   2.cit. what he cannot helpe in his nature, you account
a vice in him: you must in no way say he is couetous

   1.cit. if i must not, i neede not be barren of accusations
he hath faults (with surplus) to tyre in repetition.

showts within.

what showts are these? the other side a'th city is risen:
why stay we prating heere? to th' capitoll

   all. come, come

   1 cit. soft, who comes heere?
enter menenius agrippa.

  2 cit. worthy menenius agrippa, one that hath alwayes
lou'd the people

   1 cit. he's one honest enough, wold al the rest wer so

   men. what work's my countrimen in hand?
where go you with bats and clubs? the matter
speake i pray you

   2 cit. our busines is not vnknowne to th' senat, they
haue had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, w
now wee'l shew em in deeds: they say poore suters haue
strong breaths, they shal know we haue strong arms too

   menen. why masters, my good friends, mine honest
neighbours, will you vndo your selues?
  2 cit. we cannot sir, we are vndone already

   men. i tell you friends, most charitable care
haue the patricians of you for your wants.
your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
strike at the heauen with your staues, as lift them
against the roman state, whose course will on
the way it takes: cracking ten thousand curbes
of more strong linke assunder, then can euer
appeare in your impediment. for the dearth,
the gods, not the patricians make it, and
your knees to them (not armes) must helpe. alacke,
you are transported by calamity
thether, where more attends you, and you slander
the helmes o'th state; who care for you like fathers,
when you curse them, as enemies

   2 cit. care for vs? true indeed, they nere car'd for vs
yet. suffer vs to famish, and their store-houses cramm'd
with graine: make edicts for vsurie, to support vsurers;
repeale daily any wholsome act established against
the rich, and prouide more piercing statutes daily, to
chaine vp and restraine the poore. if the warres eate vs
not vppe, they will; and there's all the loue they beare
vs

   menen. either you must
confesse your selues wondrous malicious,
or be accus'd of folly. i shall tell you
a pretty tale, it may be you haue heard it,
but since it serues my purpose, i will venture
to scale't a little more

   2 citizen. well,
ile heare it sir: yet you must not thinke
to fobbe off our disgrace with a tale:
but and't please you deliuer

   men. there was a time, when all the bodies members
rebell'd against the belly; thus accus'd it:
that onely like a gulfe it did remaine
i'th midd'st a th' body, idle and vnactiue,
still cubbording the viand, neuer bearing
like labour with the rest, where th' other instruments
did see, and heare, deuise, instruct, walke, feele,
and mutually participate, did minister
vnto the appetite; and affection common
of the whole body, the belly answer'd

   2.cit. well sir, what answer made the belly

   men. sir, i shall tell you with a kinde of smile,
which ne're came from the lungs, but euen thus:
for looke you i may make the belly smile,
as well as speake, it taintingly replyed
to'th' discontented members, the mutinous parts
that enuied his receite: euen so most fitly,
as you maligne our senators, for that
they are not such as you

   2.cit. your bellies answer: what
the kingly crown'd head, the vigilant eye,
the counsailor heart, the arme our souldier,
our steed the legge, the tongue our trumpeter,
with other muniments and petty helpes
in this our fabricke, if that they-
  men. what then? fore me, this fellow speakes.
what then? what then?
  2.cit. should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,
who is the sinke a th' body

   men. well, what then?
  2.cit. the former agents, if they did complaine,
what could the belly answer?
  men. i will tell you,
if you'l bestow a small (of what you haue little)
patience awhile; you'st heare the bellies answer

   2.cit. y'are long about it

   men. note me this good friend;
your most graue belly was deliberate,
not rash like his accusers, and thus answered.
true is it my incorporate friends (quoth he)
that i receiue the generall food at first
which you do liue vpon: and fit it is,
because i am the store-house, and the shop
of the whole body. but, if you do remember,
i send it through the riuers of your blood
euen to the court, the heart, to th' seate o'th' braine,
and through the crankes and offices of man,
the strongest nerues, and small inferiour veines
from me receiue that naturall competencie
whereby they liue. and though that all at once
(you my good friends, this sayes the belly) marke me

   2.cit. i sir, well, well

   men. though all at once, cannot
see what i do deliuer out to each,
yet i can make my awdit vp, that all
from me do backe receiue the flowre of all,
and leaue me but the bran. what say you too't?
  2.cit. it was an answer, how apply you this?
  men. the senators of rome, are this good belly,
and you the mutinous members: for examine
their counsailes, and their cares; disgest things rightly,
touching the weale a'th common, you shall finde
no publique benefit which you receiue
but it proceeds, or comes from them to you,
and no way from your selues. what do you thinke?
you, the great toe of this assembly?
  2.cit. i the great toe? why the great toe?
  men. for that being one o'th lowest, basest, poorest
of this most wise rebellion, thou goest formost:
thou rascall, that art worst in blood to run,
lead'st first to win some vantage.
but make you ready your stiffe bats and clubs,
rome, and her rats, are at the point of battell,
the one side must haue baile.
enter caius martius.

hayle, noble martius

   mar. thanks. what's the matter you dissentious rogues
that rubbing the poore itch of your opinion,
make your selues scabs

   2.cit. we haue euer your good word

   mar. he that will giue good words to thee, wil flatter
beneath abhorring. what would you haue, you curres,
that like nor peace, nor warre? the one affrights you,
the other makes you proud. he that trusts to you,
where he should finde you lyons, findes you hares:
where foxes, geese you are: no surer, no,
then is the coale of fire vpon the ice,
or hailstone in the sun. your vertue is,
to make him worthy, whose offence subdues him,
and curse that iustice did it. who deserues greatnes,
deserues your hate: and your affections are
a sickmans appetite; who desires most that
which would encrease his euill. he that depends
vpon your fauours, swimmes with finnes of leade,
and hewes downe oakes, with rushes. hang ye: trust ye?
with euery minute you do change a minde,
and call him noble, that was now your hate:
him vilde, that was your garland. what's the matter,
that in these seuerall places of the citie,
you cry against the noble senate, who
(vnder the gods) keepe you in awe, which else
would feede on one another? what's their seeking?
  men. for corne at their owne rates, wherof they say
the citie is well stor'd

   mar. hang 'em: they say?
they'l sit by th' fire, and presume to know
what's done i'th capitoll: who's like to rise,
who thriues, & who declines: side factions, & giue out
coniecturall marriages, making parties strong,
and feebling such as stand not in their liking,
below their cobled shooes. they say ther's grain enough?
would the nobility lay aside their ruth,
and let me vse my sword, i'de make a quarrie
with thousands of these quarter'd slaues, as high
as i could picke my lance

   menen. nay these are almost thoroughly perswaded:
for though abundantly they lacke discretion
yet are they passing cowardly. but i beseech you,
what sayes the other troope?
  mar. they are dissolu'd: hang em;
they said they were an hungry, sigh'd forth prouerbes
that hunger-broke stone wals: that dogges must eate
that meate was made for mouths. that the gods sent not
corne for the richmen onely: with these shreds
they vented their complainings, which being answer'd
and a petition granted them, a strange one,
to breake the heart of generosity,
and make bold power looke pale, they threw their caps
as they would hang them on the hornes a'th moone,
shooting their emulation

   menen. what is graunted them?
  mar. fiue tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms
of their owne choice. one's iunius brutus,
sicinius velutus, and i know not. sdeath,
the rabble should haue first vnroo'st the city
ere so preuayl'd with me; it will in time
win vpon power, and throw forth greater theames
for insurrections arguing

   menen. this is strange

   mar. go get you home you fragments.
enter a messenger hastily.

  mess. where's caius martius?
  mar. heere: what's the matter!
  mes. the newes is sir, the volcies are in armes

   mar. i am glad on't, then we shall ha meanes to vent
our mustie superfluity. see our best elders.
enter sicinius velutus, annius brutus cominius, titus lartius,
with other
senatours.

  1.sen. martius 'tis true, that you haue lately told vs,
the volces are in armes

   mar. they haue a leader,
tullus auffidius that will put you too't:
i sinne in enuying his nobility:
and were i any thing but what i am,
i would wish me onely he

   com. you haue fought together?
  mar. were halfe to halfe the world by th' eares, & he
vpon my partie, i'de reuolt to make
onely my warres with him. he is a lion
that i am proud to hunt

   1.sen. then worthy martius,
attend vpon cominius to these warres

   com. it is your former promise

   mar. sir it is,
and i am constant: titus lucius, thou
shalt see me once more strike at tullus face.
what art thou stiffe? stand'st out?
  tit. no caius martius,
ile leane vpon one crutch, and fight with tother,
ere stay behinde this businesse

   men. oh true-bred

   sen. your company to'th' capitoll, where i know
our greatest friends attend vs

   tit. lead you on: follow cominius, we must followe
you, right worthy your priority

   com. noble martius

   sen. hence to your homes, be gone

   mar. nay let them follow,
the volces haue much corne: take these rats thither,
to gnaw their garners. worshipfull mutiners,
your valour puts well forth: pray follow.

exeunt.

citizens steale away. manet sicin. & brutus.

  sicin. was euer man so proud as is this martius?
  bru. he has no equall

   sicin. when we were chosen tribunes for the people

   bru. mark'd you his lip and eyes

   sicin. nay, but his taunts

   bru. being mou'd, he will not spare to gird the gods

   sicin. bemocke the modest moone

   bru. the present warres deuoure him, he is growne
too proud to be so valiant

   sicin. such a nature, tickled with good successe, disdaines
the shadow which he treads on at noone, but i do
wonder, his insolence can brooke to be commanded vnder
cominius?
  bru. fame, at the which he aymes,
in whom already he's well grac'd, cannot
better be held, nor more attain'd then by
a place below the first: for what miscarries
shall be the generals fault, though he performe
to th' vtmost of a man, and giddy censure
will then cry out of martius: oh, if he
had borne the businesse

   sicin. besides, if things go well,
opinion that so stickes on martius, shall
of his demerits rob cominius

   bru. come: halfe all cominius honors are to martius
though martius earn'd them not: and all his faults
to martius shall be honors, though indeed
in ought he merit not

   sicin. let's hence, and heare
how the dispatch is made, and in what fashion
more then his singularity, he goes
vpon this present action

   bru. let's along.

exeunt.

enter tullus auffidius with senators of coriolus.

  1.sen. so, your opinion is auffidius,
that they of rome are entred in our counsailes,
and know how we proceede,
  auf. is it not yours?
what euer haue bin thought one in this state
that could be brought to bodily act, ere rome
had circumuention: 'tis not foure dayes gone
since i heard thence, these are the words, i thinke
i haue the letter heere: yes, heere it is;
they haue prest a power, but it is not knowne
whether for east or west: the dearth is great,
the people mutinous: and it is rumour'd,
cominius, martius your old enemy
(who is of rome worse hated then of you)
and titus lartius, a most valiant roman,
these three leade on this preparation
whether 'tis bent: most likely, 'tis for you:
consider of it

   1.sen. our armie's in the field:
we neuer yet made doubt but rome was ready
to answer vs

   auf. nor did you thinke it folly,
to keepe your great pretences vayl'd, till when
they needs must shew themselues, which in the hatching
it seem'd appear'd to rome. by the discouery,
we shalbe shortned in our ayme, which was
to take in many townes, ere (almost) rome
should know we were a-foot

   2.sen. noble auffidius,
take your commission, hye you to your bands,
let vs alone to guard corioles
if they set downe before's: for the remoue
bring vp your army: but (i thinke) you'l finde
th'haue not prepar'd for vs

   auf. o doubt not that,
i speake from certainties. nay more,
some parcels of their power are forth already,
and onely hitherward. i leaue your honors.
if we, and caius martius chance to meete,
'tis sworne betweene vs, we shall euer strike
till one can do no more

   all. the gods assist you

   auf. and keepe your honors safe

   1.sen. farewell

   2.sen. farewell

   all. farewell.

exeunt. omnes.

enter volumnia and virgilia, mother and wife to martius: they set
them
downe on two lowe stooles and sowe.

  volum. i pray you daughter sing, or expresse your selfe
in a more comfortable sort: if my sonne were my husband,
i should freelier reioyce in that absence wherein
he wonne honor, then in the embracements of his bed,
where he would shew most loue. when yet hee was but
tender-bodied, and the onely sonne of my womb; when
youth with comelinesse pluck'd all gaze his way; when
for a day of kings entreaties, a mother should not sel him
an houre from her beholding; i considering how honour
would become such a person, that it was no better then
picture-like to hang by th' wall, if renowne made it not
stirre, was pleas'd to let him seeke danger, where he was
like to finde fame: to a cruell warre i sent him, from
whence he return'd, his browes bound with oake. i tell
thee daughter, i sprang not more in ioy at first hearing
he was a man-child, then now in first seeing he had proued
himselfe a man

   virg. but had he died in the businesse madame, how
then?
  volum. then his good report should haue beene my
sonne, i therein would haue found issue. heare me professe
sincerely, had i a dozen sons each in my loue alike,
and none lesse deere then thine, and my good martius, i
had rather had eleuen dye nobly for their countrey, then
one voluptuously surfet out of action.
enter a gentlewoman.

  gent. madam, the lady valeria is come to visit you

   virg. beseech you giue me leaue to retire my selfe

   volum. indeed you shall not:
me thinkes, i heare hither your husbands drumme:
see him plucke auffidius downe by th' haire:
(as children from a beare) the volces shunning him:
me thinkes i see him stampe thus, and call thus,
come on you cowards, you were got in feare
though you were borne in rome; his bloody brow
with his mail'd hand, then wiping, forth he goes
like to a haruest man, that task'd to mowe
or all, or loose his hyre

   virg. his bloody brow? oh iupiter, no blood

   volum. away you foole; it more becomes a man
then gilt his trophe. the brests of hecuba
when she did suckle hector, look'd not louelier
then hectors forhead, when it spit forth blood
at grecian sword. contenning, tell valeria
we are fit to bid her welcome.

exit gent.

  vir. heauens blesse my lord from fell auffidius

   vol. hee'l beat auffidius head below his knee,
and treade vpon his necke.
enter valeria with an vsher, and a gentlewoman.

  val. my ladies both good day to you

   vol. sweet madam

   vir. i am glad to see your ladyship

   val. how do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.
what are you sowing heere? a fine spotte in good
faith. how does your little sonne?
  vir. i thanke your lady-ship: well good madam

   vol. he had rather see the swords, and heare a drum,
then looke vpon his schoolmaster

   val. a my word the fathers sonne: ile sweare 'tis a
very pretty boy. a my troth, i look'd vpon him a wensday
halfe an houre together: ha's such a confirm'd countenance.
i saw him run after a gilded butterfly, & when
he caught it, he let it go againe, and after it againe, and ouer
and ouer he comes, and vp againe: catcht it again: or
whether his fall enrag'd him, or how 'twas, hee did so set
his teeth, and teare it. oh, i warrant how he mammockt
it

   vol. one on's fathers moods

   val. indeed la, tis a noble childe

   virg. a cracke madam

   val. come, lay aside your stitchery, i must haue you
play the idle huswife with me this afternoone

   virg. no (good madam)
i will not out of doores

   val. not out of doores?
  volum. she shall, she shall

   virg. indeed no, by your patience; ile not ouer the
threshold, till my lord returne from the warres

   val. fye, you confine your selfe most vnreasonably:
come, you must go visit the good lady that lies in

   virg. i will wish her speedy strength, and visite her
with my prayers: but i cannot go thither

   volum. why i pray you

   vlug. 'tis not to saue labour, nor that i want loue

   val. you would be another penelope: yet they say, all
the yearne she spun in vlisses absence, did but fill athica
full of mothes. come, i would your cambrick were sensible
as your finger, that you might leaue pricking it for
pitie. come you shall go with vs

   vir. no good madam, pardon me, indeed i will not
foorth

   val. in truth la go with me, and ile tell you excellent
newes of your husband

   virg. oh good madam, there can be none yet

   val. verily i do not iest with you: there came newes
from him last night

   vir. indeed madam

   val. in earnest it's true; i heard a senatour speake it.
thus it is: the volcies haue an army forth, against who[m]
cominius the generall is gone, with one part of our romane
power. your lord, and titus lartius, are set down
before their citie carioles, they nothing doubt preuailing,
and to make it breefe warres. this is true on mine
honor, and so i pray go with vs

   virg. giue me excuse good madame, i will obey you
in euery thing heereafter

   vol. let her alone ladie, as she is now:
she will but disease our better mirth

   valeria. in troth i thinke she would:

prythee virgilia turne thy solemnesse out a doore,
and go along with vs

   virgil. no

i wish you much mirth

   val. well, then farewell.

exeunt. ladies.

enter martius, titus lartius, with drumme and colours, with
captaines and
souldiers, as before the city corialus: to them a messenger.

  martius. yonder comes newes:

   lart. so, the good horse is mine

   mart. ile buy him of you

   lart. no, ile nor sel, nor giue him: lend you him i will

  mess. within this mile and halfe

   mar. then shall we heare their larum, & they ours.
now mars, i prythee make vs quicke in worke,
that we with smoaking swords may march from hence
to helpe our fielded friends. come, blow thy blast.

they sound a parley: enter two senators with others on the walles
of
corialus.

tullus auffidious, is he within your walles?
  1.senat. no, nor a man that feares you lesse then he,
that's lesser then a little:

drum a farre off.

hearke, our drummes
are bringing forth our youth: wee'l breake our walles
rather then they shall pound vs vp our gates,
which yet seeme shut, we haue but pin'd with rushes,
they'le open of themselues. harke you, farre off

enter the army of the volces.

  mar. they feare vs not, but issue forth their citie.
now put your shields before your hearts, and fight
with hearts more proofe then shields.
aduance braue titus,
they do disdaine vs much beyond our thoughts,
which makes me sweat with wrath. come on my fellows
he that retires, ile take him for a volce,
and he shall feele mine edge.

alarum, the romans are beat back to their trenches enter martius
cursing.

  mar. all the contagion of the south, light on you,
you shames of rome: you heard of byles and plagues
plaister you o're, that you may be abhorr'd
farther then seene, and one infect another
against the winde a mile: you soules of geese,
that beare the shapes of men, how haue you run
from slaues, that apes would beate; pluto and hell,
all hurt behinde, backes red, and faces pale
with flight and agued feare, mend and charge home,
or by the fires of heauen, ile leaue the foe,
and make my warres on you: looke too't: come on,
if you'l stand fast, wee'l beate them to their wiues,
as they vs to our trenches followes.

another alarum, and martius followes them to gates, and is shut
in.

clapt to their gates, he is himselfe alone,
to answer all the city

   lar. oh noble fellow!
who sensibly out-dares his sencelesse sword,
and when it bowes, stand'st vp: thou art left martius,
a carbuncle intire: as big as thou art
weare not so rich a iewell. thou was't a souldier
euen to calues wish, not fierce and terrible
onely in strokes, but with thy grim lookes, and
the thunder-like percussion of thy sounds
thou mad'st thine enemies shake, as if the world
were feauorous, and did tremble.
enter martius bleeding, assaulted by the enemy.

  1.sol. looke sir

   lar. o 'tis martius.
let's fetch him off, or make remaine alike.

they fight, and all enter the city.

enter certaine romanes with spoiles.

exeunt.

alarum continues still a-farre off.

enter martius, and titus with a trumpet.

  mar. see heere these mouers, that do prize their hours
at a crack'd drachme: cushions, leaden spoones,
irons of a doit, dublets that hangmen would
bury with those that wore them. these base slaues,
ere yet the fight be done, packe vp, downe with them.
and harke, what noyse the generall makes: to him
there is the man of my soules hate, auffidious,
piercing our romanes: then valiant titus take
conuenient numbers to make good the city,
whil'st i with those that haue the spirit, wil haste
to helpe cominius

   lar. worthy sir, thou bleed'st,
thy exercise hath bin too violent,
for a second course of fight

   mar. sir, praise me not:
my worke hath yet not warm'd me. fare you well:
the blood i drop, is rather physicall
then dangerous to me: to auffidious thus, i will appear and fight

   lar. now the faire goddesse fortune,
fall deepe in loue with thee, and her great charmes
misguide thy opposers swords, bold gentleman:
prosperity be thy page

   mar. thy friend no lesse,
then those she placeth highest: so farewell

   lar. thou worthiest martius,
go sound thy trumpet in the market place,
call thither all the officers a'th' towne,
where they shall know our minde. away.

exeunt.

enter cominius as it were in retire, with soldiers.

  com. breath you my friends, wel fought, we are come off,
like romans, neither foolish in our stands,
nor cowardly in retyre: beleeue me sirs,
we shall be charg'd againe. whiles we haue strooke
by interims and conueying gusts, we haue heard
the charges of our friends. the roman gods,
leade their successes, as we wish our owne,
that both our powers, with smiling fronts encountring,
may giue you thankfull sacrifice. thy newes?
enter a messenger.

  mess. the cittizens of corioles haue yssued,
and giuen to lartius and to martius battaile:
i saw our party to their trenches driuen,
and then i came away

   com. though thou speakest truth,
me thinkes thou speak'st not well. how long is't since?
  mes. aboue an houre, my lord

   com. 'tis not a mile: briefely we heard their drummes.
how could'st thou in a mile confound an houre,
and bring thy newes so late?
  mes. spies of the volces
held me in chace, that i was forc'd to wheele
three or foure miles about, else had i sir
halfe an houre since brought my report.
enter martius.

  com. whose yonder,
that doe's appeare as he were flead? o gods,
he has the stampe of martius, and i haue
before time seene him thus

   mar. come i too late?
  com. the shepherd knowes not thunder fro[m] a taber,
more then i know the sound of martius tongue
from euery meaner man

   martius. come i too late?
  com. i, if you come not in the blood of others,
but mantled in your owne

   mart. oh! let me clip ye
in armes as sound, as when i woo'd in heart;
as merry, as when our nuptiall day was done,
and tapers burnt to bedward

   com. flower of warriors, how is't with titus lartius?
  mar. as with a man busied about decrees:
condemning some to death, and some to exile,
ransoming him, or pittying, threatning th' other;
holding corioles in the name of rome,
euen like a fawning grey-hound in the leash,
to let him slip at will

   com. where is that slaue
which told me they had beate you to your trenches?
where is he? call him hither

   mar. let him alone,
he did informe the truth: but for our gentlemen,
the common file, (a plague-tribunes for them)
the mouse ne're shunn'd the cat, as they did budge
from rascals worse then they

   com. but how preuail'd you?
  mar. will the time serue to tell, i do not thinke:
where is the enemy? are you lords a'th field?
if not, why cease you till you are so?
  com. martius, we haue at disaduantage fought,
and did retyre to win our purpose

   mar. how lies their battell? know you on w side
they haue plac'd their men of trust?
  com. as i guesse martius,
their bands i'th vaward are the antients
of their best trust: o're them auffidious,
their very heart of hope

   mar. i do beseech you,
by all the battailes wherein we haue fought,
by th' blood we haue shed together,
by th' vowes we haue made
to endure friends, that you directly set me
against affidious, and his antiats,
and that you not delay the present (but
filling the aire with swords aduanc'd) and darts,
we proue this very houre

   com. though i could wish,
you were conducted to a gentle bath,
and balmes applyed to you, yet dare i neuer
deny your asking, take your choice of those
that best can ayde your action

   mar. those are they
that most are willing; if any such be heere,
(as it were sinne to doubt) that loue this painting
wherein you see me smear'd, if any feare
lessen his person, then an ill report:
if any thinke, braue death out-weighes bad life,
and that his countries deerer then himselfe,
let him alone: or so many so minded,
waue thus to expresse his disposition,
and follow martius.

they all shout and waue their swords, take him vp in their armes,
and cast
vp their caps.

oh me alone, make you a sword of me:
if these shewes be not outward, which of you
but is foure volces? none of you, but is
able to beare against the great auffidious
a shield, as hard as his. a certaine number
(though thankes to all) must i select from all:
the rest shall beare the businesse in some other fight
(as cause will be obey'd:) please you to march,
and foure shall quickly draw out my command,
which men are best inclin'd

   com. march on my fellowes:
make good this ostentation, and you shall
diuide in all, with vs.

exeunt.

titus lartius, hauing set a guard vpon carioles, going with drum
and
trumpet toward cominius, and caius martius, enters with a
lieutenant,
other souldiours, and a scout.

  lar. so, let the ports be guarded; keepe your duties
as i haue set them downe. if i do send, dispatch
those centuries to our ayd, the rest will serue
for a short holding, if we loose the field,
we cannot keepe the towne

   lieu. feare not our care sir

   lart. hence; and shut your gates vpon's:
our guider come, to th' roman campe conduct vs.

exit

alarum, as in battaile.

enter martius and auffidius at seueral doores.

  mar. ile fight with none but thee, for i do hate thee
worse then a promise-breaker

   auffid. we hate alike:
not affricke ownes a serpent i abhorre
more then thy fame and enuy: fix thy foot

   mar. let the first budger dye the others slaue,
and the gods doome him after

   auf. if i flye martius, hollow me like a hare

   mar. within these three houres tullus
alone i fought in your corioles walles,
and made what worke i pleas'd: 'tis not my blood,
wherein thou seest me maskt, for thy reuenge
wrench vp thy power to th' highest

   auf. wer't thou the hector,
that was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,
thou should'st not scape me heere.

heere they fight, and certaine volces come in the ayde of auffi.
martius
fights til they be driuen in breathles.

officious and not valiant, you haue sham'd me
in your condemned seconds.

flourish. alarum. a retreat is sounded. enter at one doore
cominius, with
the romanes: at another doore martius, with his arme in a
scarfe.

  com. if i should tell thee o're this thy dayes worke,
thou't not beleeue thy deeds: but ile report it,
where senators shall mingle teares with smiles,
where great patricians shall attend, and shrug,
i'th' end admire: where ladies shall be frighted,
and gladly quak'd, heare more: where the dull tribunes,
that with the fustie plebeans, hate thine honors,
shall say against their hearts, we thanke the gods
our rome hath such a souldier.
yet cam'st thou to a morsell of this feast,
hauing fully din'd before.
enter titus with his power, from the pursuit.

  titus lartius. oh generall:
here is the steed, wee the caparison:
hadst thou beheld-
  martius. pray now, no more:
my mother, who ha's a charter to extoll her bloud,
when she do's prayse me, grieues me:
i haue done as you haue done, that's what i can,
induc'd as you haue beene, that's for my countrey:
he that ha's but effected his good will,
hath ouerta'ne mine act

   com. you shall not be the graue of your deseruing,
rome must know the value of her owne:
'twere a concealement worse then a theft,
no lesse then a traducement,
to hide your doings, and to silence that,
which to the spire, and top of prayses vouch'd,
would seeme but modest: therefore i beseech you,
in signe of what you are, not to reward
what you haue done, before our armie heare me

   martius. i haue some wounds vpon me, and they smart
to heare themselues remembred

   com. should they not:
well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,
and tent themselues with death: of all the horses,
whereof we haue ta'ne good, and good store of all,
the treasure in this field atchieued, and citie,
we render you the tenth, to be ta'ne forth,
before the common distribution,
at your onely choyse

   martius. i thanke you generall:
but cannot make my heart consent to take
a bribe, to pay my sword: i doe refuse it,
and stand vpon my common part with those,
that haue beheld the doing.

a long flourish. they all cry, martius, martius, cast vp their caps
and
launces: cominius and lartius stand bare.

  mar. may these same instruments, which you prophane,
neuer sound more: when drums and trumpets shall
i'th' field proue flatterers, let courts and cities be
made all of false-fac'd soothing:
when steele growes soft, as the parasites silke,
let him be made an ouerture for th' warres:
no more i say, for that i haue not wash'd
my nose that bled, or foyl'd some debile wretch,
which without note, here's many else haue done,
you shoot me forth in acclamations hyperbolicall,
as if i lou'd my little should be dieted
in prayses, sawc'st with lyes

   com. too modest are you:
more cruell to your good report, then gratefull
to vs, that giue you truly: by your patience,
if 'gainst your selfe you be incens'd, wee'le put you
(like one that meanes his proper harme) in manacles,
then reason safely with you: therefore be it knowne,
as to vs, to all the world, that caius martius
weares this warres garland: in token of the which,
my noble steed, knowne to the campe, i giue him,
with all his trim belonging; and from this time,
for what he did before corioles, call him,
with all th' applause and clamor of the hoast,
marcus caius coriolanus. beare th' addition nobly euer?
flourish. trumpets sound, and drums.

  omnes. marcus caius coriolanus

   martius. i will goe wash:
and when my face is faire, you shall perceiue
whether i blush or no: howbeit, i thanke you,
i meane to stride your steed, and at all times
to vnder-crest your good addition,
to th' fairenesse of my power

   com. so, to our tent:
where ere we doe repose vs, we will write
to rome of our successe: you titus lartius
must to corioles backe, send vs to rome
the best, with whom we may articulate,
for their owne good, and ours

   lartius. i shall, my lord

   martius. the gods begin to mocke me:
i that now refus'd most princely gifts,
am bound to begge of my lord generall

   com. tak't, 'tis yours: what is't?
  martius. i sometime lay here in corioles,
at a poore mans house: he vs'd me kindly,
he cry'd to me: i saw him prisoner:
but then auffidius was within my view,
and wrath o're-whelm'd my pittie: i request you
to giue my poore host freedome

   com. oh well begg'd:
were he the butcher of my sonne, he should
be free, as is the winde: deliuer him, titus

   lartius. martius, his name

   martius. by iupiter forgot:
i am wearie, yea, my memorie is tyr'd:
haue we no wine here?
  com. goe we to our tent:
the bloud vpon your visage dryes, 'tis time
it should be lookt too: come.

exeunt.

being a volce, be that i am. condition?
what good condition can a treatie finde
i'th' part that is at mercy? fiue times, martius,
i haue fought with thee; so often hast thou beat me:
and would'st doe so, i thinke, should we encounter
as often as we eate. by th' elements,
if ere againe i meet him beard to beard,
he's mine, or i am his: mine emulation
hath not that honor in't it had: for where
i thought to crush him in an equall force,
true sword to sword: ile potche at him some way,
or wrath, or craft may get him

   sol. he's the diuell

   auf. bolder, though not so subtle: my valors poison'd,
with onely suff'ring staine by him: for him
shall flye out of it selfe, nor sleepe, nor sanctuary,
being naked, sicke; nor phane, nor capitoll,
the prayers of priests, nor times of sacrifice:
embarquements all of fury, shall lift vp
their rotten priuiledge, and custome 'gainst
my hate to martius. where i finde him, were it
at home, vpon my brothers guard, euen there
against the hospitable canon, would i
wash my fierce hand in's heart. go you to th' citie,
learne how 'tis held, and what they are that must
be hostages for rome

   soul. will not you go?
  auf. i am attended at the cyprus groue. i pray you
('tis south the city mils) bring me word thither
how the world goes: that to the pace of it
i may spurre on my iourney

   soul. i shall sir.

actus secundus.


enter menenius with the two tribunes of the people, sicinius &
brutus.

  men. the agurer tels me, wee shall haue newes to
night

   bru. good or bad?
  men. not according to the prayer of the people, for
they loue not martius

   sicin. nature teaches beasts to know their friends

   men. pray you, who does the wolfe loue?
  sicin. the lambe

   men. i, to deuour him, as the hungry plebeians would
the noble martius

   bru. he's a lambe indeed, that baes like a beare

   men. hee's a beare indeede, that liues like a lambe.
you two are old men, tell me one thing that i shall aske
you

   both. well sir

   men. in what enormity is martius poore in, that you
two haue not in abundance?
  bru. he's poore in no one fault, but stor'd withall

   sicin. especially in pride

   bru. and topping all others in boasting

   men. this is strange now: do you two know, how
you are censured heere in the city, i mean of vs a'th' right
hand file, do you?
  both. why? how are we censur'd?
  men. because you talke of pride now, will you not
be angry

   both. well, well sir, well

   men. why 'tis no great matter: for a very little theefe
of occasion, will rob you of a great deale of patience:
giue your dispositions the reines, and bee angry at your
pleasures (at the least) if you take it as a pleasure to you, in
being so: you blame martius for being proud

   brut. we do it not alone, sir

   men. i know you can doe very little alone, for your
helpes are many, or else your actions would growe wondrous
single: your abilities are to infant-like, for dooing
much alone. you talke of pride: oh, that you could turn
your eyes toward the napes of your neckes, and make
but an interiour suruey of your good selues. oh that you
could

   both. what then sir?
  men. why then you should discouer a brace of vnmeriting,
proud, violent, testie magistrates (alias fooles)
as any in rome

   sicin. menenius, you are knowne well enough too

   men. i am knowne to be a humorous patritian, and
one that loues a cup of hot wine, with not a drop of alaying
tiber in't: said, to be something imperfect in fauouring
the first complaint, hasty and tinder-like vppon, to
triuiall motion: one, that conuerses more with the buttocke
of the night, then with the forhead of the morning.
what i think, i vtter, and spend my malice in my breath.
meeting two such weales men as you are (i cannot call
you licurgusses,) if the drinke you giue me, touch my palat
aduersly, i make a crooked face at it, i can say, your
worshippes haue deliuer'd the matter well, when i finde
the asse in compound, with the maior part of your syllables.
and though i must be content to beare with those,
that say you are reuerend graue men, yet they lye deadly,
that tell you haue good faces, if you see this in the map
of my microcosme, followes it that i am knowne well enough
too? what harme can your beesome conspectuities
gleane out of this charracter, if i be knowne well enough
too

   bru. come sir come, we know you well enough

   menen. you know neither mee, your selues, nor any
thing: you are ambitious, for poore knaues cappes and
legges: you weare out a good wholesome forenoone, in
hearing a cause betweene an orendge wife, and a forfetseller,
and then reiourne the controuersie of three-pence
to a second day of audience. when you are hearing a
matter betweene party and party, if you chaunce to bee
pinch'd with the collike, you make faces like mummers,
set vp the bloodie flagge against all patience, and
in roaring for a chamber-pot, dismisse the controuersie
bleeding, the more intangled by your hearing: all the
peace you make in their cause, is calling both the parties
knaues. you are a payre of strange ones

   bru. come, come, you are well vnderstood to bee a
perfecter gyber for the table, then a necessary bencher in
the capitoll

   men. our very priests must become mockers, if they
shall encounter such ridiculous subiects as you are, when
you speake best vnto the purpose. it is not woorth the
wagging of your beards, and your beards deserue not so
honourable a graue, as to stuffe a botchers cushion, or to
be intomb'd in an asses packe-saddle; yet you must bee
saying, martius is proud: who in a cheape estimation, is
worth all your predecessors, since deucalion, though peraduenture
some of the best of 'em were hereditarie hangmen.
godden to your worships, more of your conuersation
would infect my braine, being the heardsmen of
the beastly plebeans. i will be bold to take my leaue of
you.

auffidius got off

that: and he had stay'd by him, i would not haue been so
fiddious'd, for all the chests in carioles, and the gold

  volum. good ladies let's goe. yes, yes, yes: the

from whom i haue receiu'd not onely greetings,
but with them, change of honors

   volum. i haue liued,
to see inherited my very wishes,
and the buildings of my fancie:
onely there's one thing wanting,
which (i doubt not) but our rome
will cast vpon thee

   cor. know, good mother,
i had rather be their seruant in my way,
then sway with them in theirs

   com. on, to the capitall.
flourish. cornets.

exeunt. in state, as before.

enter brutus and scicinius

  bru. all tongues speake of him, and the bleared sights
are spectacled to see him. your pratling nurse
into a rapture lets her baby crie,
while she chats him: the kitchin malkin pinnes
her richest lockram 'bout her reechie necke,
clambring the walls to eye him:
stalls, bulkes, windowes, are smother'd vp,
leades fill'd, and ridges hors'd
with variable complexions; all agreeing
in earnestnesse to see him: seld-showne flamins
doe presse among the popular throngs, and puffe
to winne a vulgar station: our veyl'd dames
commit the warre of white and damaske
in their nicely gawded cheekes, toth' wanton spoyle
of phoebus burning kisses: such a poother,
as if that whatsoeuer god, who leades him,
were slyly crept into his humane powers,
and gaue him gracefull posture

   scicin. on the suddaine, i warrant him consull

   brutus. then our office may, during his power, goe
sleepe

   scicin. he cannot temp'rately transport his honors,
from where he should begin, and end, but will
lose those he hath wonne

   brutus. in that there's comfort

   scici. doubt not,
the commoners, for whom we stand, but they
vpon their ancient mallice, will forget
with the least cause, these his new honors,
which that he will giue them, make i as little question,
as he is prowd to doo't

   brutus. i heard him sweare,
were he to stand for consull, neuer would he
appeare i'th' market place, nor on him put
the naples vesture of humilitie,
nor shewing (as the manner is) his wounds
toth' people, begge their stinking breaths

   scicin. 'tis right

   brutus. it was his word:
oh he would misse it, rather then carry it,
but by the suite of the gentry to him,
and the desire of the nobles

   scicin. i wish no better, then haue him hold that purpose,
and to put it in execution

   brutus. 'tis most like he will

   scicin. it shall be to him then, as our good wills; a
sure destruction

   brutus. so it must fall out
to him, or our authorities, for an end.
we must suggest the people, in what hatred
he still hath held them: that to's power he would
haue made them mules, silenc'd their pleaders,
and dispropertied their freedomes; holding them,
in humane action, and capacitie,
of no more soule, nor fitnesse for the world,
then cammels in their warre, who haue their prouand
onely for bearing burthens, and sore blowes
for sinking vnder them

   scicin. this (as you say) suggested,
at some time, when his soaring insolence
shall teach the people, which time shall not want,
if he be put vpon't, and that's as easie,
as to set dogges on sheepe, will be his fire
to kindle their dry stubble: and their blaze
shall darken him for euer.
enter a messenger.

  brutus. what's the matter?
  mess. you are sent for to the capitoll:
'tis thought, that martius shall be consull:
i haue seene the dumbe men throng to see him,
and the blind to heare him speak: matrons flong gloues,
ladies and maids their scarffes, and handkerchers,
vpon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended
as to ioues statue, and the commons made
a shower, and thunder, with their caps, and showts:
i neuer saw the like

   brutus. let's to the capitoll,
and carry with vs eares and eyes for th' time,
but hearts for the euent

   scicin. haue with you.

exeunt.

enter two officers, to lay cushions, as it were, in the capitoll.

  1.off. come, come, they are almost here: how many
stand for consulships?
  2.off. three, they say: but 'tis thought of euery one,
coriolanus will carry it

   1.off. that's a braue fellow: but hee's vengeance
prowd, and loues not the common people

   2.off. 'faith, there hath beene many great men that
haue flatter'd the people, who ne're loued them; and there
be many that they haue loued, they know not wherefore:
so that if they loue they know not why, they hate vpon
no better a ground. therefore, for coriolanus neyther to
care whether they loue, or hate him, manifests the true
knowledge he ha's in their disposition, and out of his noble
carelesnesse lets them plainely see't

   1.off. if he did not care whether he had their loue, or
no, hee waued indifferently, 'twixt doing them neyther
good, nor harme: but hee seekes their hate with greater
deuotion, then they can render it him; and leaues nothing
vndone, that may fully discouer him their opposite. now
to seeme to affect the mallice and displeasure of the people,
is as bad, as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for
their loue

   2.off. hee hath deserued worthily of his countrey,
and his assent is not by such easie degrees as those, who
hauing beene supple and courteous to the people, bonnetted,
without any further deed, to haue them at all into
their estimation, and report: but hee hath so planted his
honors in their eyes, and his actions in their hearts, that
for their tongues to be silent, and not confesse so much,
were a kinde of ingratefull iniurie: to report otherwise,
were a mallice, that giuing it selfe the lye, would plucke
reproofe and rebuke from euery eare that heard it

   1.off. no more of him, hee's a worthy man: make
way, they are comming.

a sennet. enter the patricians, and the tribunes of the people,
lictors
before them: coriolanus, menenius, cominius the consul:
scicinius and
brutus take their places by themselues: coriolanus stands.

  menen. hauing determin'd of the volces,
and to send for titus lartius: it remaines,
as the maine point of this our after-meeting,
to gratifie his noble seruice, that hath
thus stood for his countrey. therefore please you,
most reuerend and graue elders, to desire
the present consull, and last generall,
in our well-found successes, to report
a little of that worthy worke, perform'd
by martius caius coriolanus: whom
we met here, both to thanke, and to remember,
with honors like himselfe

   1.sen. speake, good cominius:
leaue nothing out for length, and make vs thinke
rather our states defectiue for requitall,
then we to stretch it out. masters a'th' people,
we doe request your kindest eares: and after
your louing motion toward the common body,
to yeeld what passes here

   scicin. we are conuented vpon a pleasing treatie, and
haue hearts inclinable to honor and aduance the theame
of our assembly

   brutus. which the rather wee shall be blest to doe, if
he remember a kinder value of the people, then he hath
hereto priz'd them at

   menen. that's off, that's off: i would you rather had
been silent: please you to heare cominius speake?
  brutus. most willingly: but yet my caution was
more pertinent then the rebuke you giue it

   menen. he loues your people, but tye him not to be
their bed-fellow: worthie cominius speake.

coriolanus rises, and offers to goe away.

nay, keepe your place

   senat. sit coriolanus: neuer shame to heare
what you haue nobly done

   coriol. your honors pardon:
i had rather haue my wounds to heale againe,
then heare say how i got them

   brutus. sir, i hope my words dis-bench'd you not?
  coriol. no sir: yet oft,
when blowes haue made me stay, i fled from words.
you sooth'd not, therefore hurt not: but your people,
i loue them as they weigh-
  menen. pray now sit downe

   corio. i had rather haue one scratch my head i'th' sun,
when the alarum were strucke, then idly sit
to heare my nothings monster'd.
exit coriolanus

  menen. masters of the people,
your multiplying spawne, how can he flatter?
that's thousand to one good one, when you now see
he had rather venture all his limbes for honor,
then on ones eares to heare it. proceed cominius

   com. i shall lacke voyce: the deeds of coriolanus
should not be vtter'd feebly: it is held,
that valour is the chiefest vertue,
and most dignifies the hauer: if it be,
the man i speake of, cannot in the world
be singly counter-poys'd. at sixteene yeeres,
when tarquin made a head for rome, he fought
beyond the marke of others: our then dictator,
whom with all prayse i point at, saw him fight,
when with his amazonian shinne he droue
the brizled lippes before him: he bestrid
an o're-prest roman, and i'th' consuls view
slew three opposers: tarquins selfe he met,
and strucke him on his knee: in that dayes feates,
when he might act the woman in the scene,
he prou'd best man i'th' field, and for his meed
was brow-bound with the oake. his pupill age
man-entred thus, he waxed like a sea,
and in the brunt of seuenteene battailes since,
he lurcht all swords of the garland: for this last,
before, and in corioles, let me say
i cannot speake him home: he stopt the flyers,
and by his rare example made the coward
turne terror into sport: as weeds before
a vessell vnder sayle, so men obey'd,
and fell below his stem: his sword, deaths stampe,
where it did marke, it tooke from face to foot:
he was a thing of blood, whose euery motion
was tim'd with dying cryes: alone he entred
the mortall gate of th' citie, which he painted
with shunlesse destinie: aydelesse came off,
and with a sudden re-inforcement strucke
carioles like a planet: now all's his,
when by and by the dinne of warre gan pierce
his readie sence: then straight his doubled spirit
requickned what in flesh was fatigate,
and to the battaile came he, where he did
runne reeking o're the liues of men, as if 'twere
a perpetuall spoyle: and till we call'd
both field and citie ours, he neuer stood
to ease his brest with panting

   menen. worthy man

   senat. he cannot but with measure fit the honors
which we deuise him

   com. our spoyles he kickt at,
and look'd vpon things precious, as they were
the common muck of the world: he couets lesse
then miserie it selfe would giue, rewards his deeds
with doing them, and is content
to spend the time, to end it

   menen. hee's right noble, let him be call'd for

   senat. call coriolanus

   off. he doth appeare.
enter coriolanus.

  menen. the senate, coriolanus, are well pleas'd to make
thee consull

   corio. i doe owe them still my life, and seruices

   menen. it then remaines, that you doe speake to the
people

   corio. i doe beseech you,
let me o're-leape that custome: for i cannot
put on the gowne, stand naked, and entreat them
for my wounds sake, to giue their sufferage:
please you that i may passe this doing

   scicin. sir, the people must haue their voyces,
neyther will they bate one iot of ceremonie

   menen. put them not too't:
pray you goe fit you to the custome,
and take to you, as your predecessors haue,
your honor with your forme

   corio. it is a part that i shall blush in acting,
and might well be taken from the people

   brutus. marke you that

   corio. to brag vnto them, thus i did, and thus
shew them th' vnaking skarres, which i should hide,
as if i had receiu'd them for the hyre
of their breath onely

   menen. doe not stand vpon't:
we recommend to you tribunes of the people
our purpose to them, and to our noble consull
wish we all ioy, and honor

   senat. to coriolanus come all ioy and honor.
flourish cornets. then exeunt. manet sicinius and brutus.

  bru. you see how he intends to vse the people

   scicin. may they perceiue's intent: he wil require them
as if he did contemne what he requested,
should be in them to giue

   bru. come, wee'l informe them
of our proceedings heere on th' market place,
i know they do attend vs.
enter seuen or eight citizens.

  1.cit. once if he do require our voyces, wee ought
not to deny him

   2.cit. we may sir if we will

   3.cit. we haue power in our selues to do it, but it is
a power that we haue no power to do: for, if hee shew vs
his wounds, and tell vs his deeds, we are to put our tongues
into those wounds, and speake for them: so if he tel
vs his noble deeds, we must also tell him our noble acceptance
of them. ingratitude is monstrous, and for the
multitude to be ingratefull, were to make a monster of
the multitude; of the which, we being members, should
bring our selues to be monstrous members

   1.cit. and to make vs no better thought of a little
helpe will serue: for once we stood vp about the corne,
he himselfe stucke not to call vs the many-headed multitude

   3.cit. we haue beene call'd so of many, not that our
heads are some browne, some blacke, some abram, some
bald; but that our wits are so diuersly coulord; and truely
i thinke, if all our wittes were to issue out of one scull,
they would flye east, west, north, south, and their consent
of one direct way, should be at once to all the points
a'th compasse

   2.cit. thinke you so? which way do you iudge my
wit would flye

   3.cit. nay your wit will not so soone out as another
mans will, 'tis strongly wadg'd vp in a blocke-head: but
if it were at liberty, 'twould sure southward

   2 cit. why that way?
  3 cit. to loose it selfe in a fogge, where being three
parts melted away with rotten dewes, the fourth would
returne for conscience sake, to helpe to get thee a wife

   2 cit. you are neuer without your trickes, you may,
you may

   3 cit. are you all resolu'd to giue your voyces? but
that's no matter, the greater part carries it, i say. if hee
would incline to the people, there was neuer a worthier
man.
enter coriolanus in a gowne of humility, with menenius.

heere he comes, and in the gowne of humility, marke
his behauiour: we are not to stay altogether, but to come
by him where he stands, by ones, by twoes, & by threes.
he's to make his requests by particulars, wherein euerie
one of vs ha's a single honor, in giuing him our own voices
with our owne tongues, therefore follow me, and ile
direct you how you shall go by him

   all. content, content

   men. oh sir, you are not right: haue you not knowne
the worthiest men haue done't?
  corio. what must i say, i pray sir?
plague vpon't, i cannot bring
my tongue to such a pace. looke sir, my wounds,
i got them in my countries seruice, when
some certaine of your brethren roar'd, and ranne
from th' noise of our owne drummes

   menen. oh me the gods, you must not speak of that,
you must desire them to thinke vpon you

   coriol. thinke vpon me? hang 'em,
i would they would forget me, like the vertues
which our diuines lose by em

   men. you'l marre all,
ile leaue you: pray you speake to em, i pray you
in wholsome manner.

exit

enter three of the citizens.

  corio. bid them wash their faces,
and keepe their teeth cleane: so, heere comes a brace,
you know the cause (sir) of my standing heere

   3 cit. we do sir, tell vs what hath brought you too't

   corio. mine owne desert

   2 cit. your owne desert

   corio. i, but mine owne desire

   3 cit. how not your owne desire?
  corio. no sir, 'twas neuer my desire yet to trouble the
poore with begging

   3 cit. you must thinke if we giue you any thing, we
hope to gaine by you

   corio. well then i pray, your price a'th' consulship

   1 cit. the price is, to aske it kindly

   corio. kindly sir, i pray let me ha't: i haue wounds to
shew you, which shall bee yours in priuate: your good
voice sir, what say you?
  2 cit. you shall ha't worthy sir

   corio. a match sir, there's in all two worthie voyces
begg'd: i haue your almes, adieu

   3 cit. but this is something odde

   2 cit. and 'twere to giue againe: but 'tis no matter.

exeunt. enter two other citizens.

  coriol. pray you now, if it may stand with the tune
of your voices, that i may bee consull, i haue heere the
customarie gowne

   1. you haue deserued nobly of your countrey, and
you haue not deserued nobly

   coriol. your aenigma

   1. you haue bin a scourge to her enemies, you haue
bin a rod to her friends, you haue not indeede loued the
common people

   coriol. you should account mee the more vertuous,
that i haue not bin common in my loue, i will sir flatter
my sworne brother the people to earne a deerer estimation
of them, 'tis a condition they account gentle: & since
the wisedome of their choice, is rather to haue my hat,
then my heart, i will practice the insinuating nod, and be
off to them most counterfetly, that is sir, i will counterfet
the bewitchment of some popular man, and giue it
bountifull to the desirers: therefore beseech you, i may
be consull

   2. wee hope to finde you our friend: and therefore
giue you our voices heartily

   1. you haue receyued many wounds for your countrey

   coriol. i wil not seale your knowledge with shewing
them. i will make much of your voyces, and so trouble
you no farther

   both. the gods giue you ioy sir heartily

   coriol. most sweet voyces:
better it is to dye, better to sterue,
then craue the higher, which first we do deserue.
why in this wooluish tongue should i stand heere,
to begge of hob and dicke, that does appeere
their needlesse vouches: custome calls me too't.
what custome wills in all things, should we doo't?
the dust on antique time would lye vnswept,
and mountainous error be too highly heapt,
for truth to o're-peere. rather then foole it so,
let the high office and the honor go
to one that would doe thus. i am halfe through,
the one part suffered, the other will i doe.
enter three citizens more.

here come moe voyces.
your voyces? for your voyces i haue sought,
watcht for your voyces: for your voyces, beare
of wounds, two dozen odde: battailes thrice six
i haue seene, and heard of: for your voyces,
haue done many things, some lesse, some more:
your voyces? indeed i would be consull

   1.cit. hee ha's done nobly, and cannot goe without
any honest mans voyce

   2.cit. therefore let him be consull: the gods giue him
ioy, and make him good friend to the people

   all. amen, amen. god saue thee, noble consull

   corio. worthy voyces.
enter menenius, with brutus and scicinius.

  mene. you haue stood your limitation:
and the tribunes endue you with the peoples voyce,
remaines, that in th' officiall markes inuested,
you anon doe meet the senate

   corio. is this done?
  scicin. the custome of request you haue discharg'd:
the people doe admit you, and are summon'd
to meet anon, vpon your approbation

   corio. where? at the senate-house?
  scicin. there, coriolanus

   corio. may i change these garments?
  scicin. you may, sir

   cori. that ile straight do: and knowing my selfe again,
repayre toth' senatehouse

   mene. ile keepe you company. will you along?
  brut. we stay here for the people

   scicin. fare you well.

exeunt. coriol. and mene.

he ha's it now: and by his lookes, me thinkes,
'tis warme at's heart

   brut. with a prowd heart he wore his humble weeds:
will you dismisse the people?
enter the plebeians.

  scici. how now, my masters, haue you chose this man?
  1.cit. he ha's our voyces, sir

   brut. we pray the gods, he may deserue your loues

   2.cit. amen, sir: to my poore vnworthy notice,
he mock'd vs, when he begg'd our voyces

   3.cit. certainely, he flowted vs downe-right

   1.cit. no, 'tis his kind of speech, he did not mock vs

   2.cit. not one amongst vs, saue your selfe, but sayes
he vs'd vs scornefully: he should haue shew'd vs
his marks of merit, wounds receiu'd for's countrey

   scicin. why so he did, i am sure

   all. no, no: no man saw 'em

   3.cit. hee said hee had wounds,
which he could shew in priuate:
and with his hat, thus wauing it in scorne,
i would be consull, sayes he: aged custome,
but by your voyces, will not so permit me.
your voyces therefore: when we graunted that,
here was, i thanke you for your voyces, thanke you
your most sweet voyces: now you haue left your voyces,
i haue no further with you. was not this mockerie?
  scicin. why eyther were you ignorant to see't?
or seeing it, of such childish friendlinesse,
to yeeld your voyces?
  brut. could you not haue told him,
as you were lesson'd: when he had no power,
but was a pettie seruant to the state,
he was your enemie, euer spake against
your liberties, and the charters that you beare
i'th' body of the weale: and now arriuing
a place of potencie, and sway o'th' state,
if he should still malignantly remaine
fast foe toth' plebeij, your voyces might
be curses to your selues. you should haue said,
that as his worthy deeds did clayme no lesse
then what he stood for: so his gracious nature
would thinke vpon you, for your voyces,
and translate his mallice towards you, into loue,
standing your friendly lord

   scicin. thus to haue said,
as you were fore-aduis'd, had toucht his spirit,
and try'd his inclination: from him pluckt
eyther his gracious promise, which you might
as cause had call'd you vp, haue held him to;
or else it would haue gall'd his surly nature,
which easily endures not article,
tying him to ought, so putting him to rage,
you should haue ta'ne th' aduantage of his choller,
and pass'd him vnelected

   brut. did you perceiue,
he did sollicite you in free contempt,
when he did need your loues: and doe you thinke,
that his contempt shall not be brusing to you,
when he hath power to crush? why, had your bodyes
no heart among you? or had you tongues, to cry
against the rectorship of iudgement?
  scicin. haue you, ere now, deny'd the asker:
and now againe, of him that did not aske, but mock,
bestow your su'd-for tongues?
  3.cit. hee's not confirm'd, we may deny him yet

   2.cit. and will deny him:
ile haue fiue hundred voyces of that sound

   1.cit. i twice fiue hundred, & their friends, to piece 'em

   brut. get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,
they haue chose a consull, that will from them take
their liberties, make them of no more voyce
then dogges, that are as often beat for barking,
as therefore kept to doe so

   scici. let them assemble: and on a safer iudgement,
all reuoke your ignorant election: enforce his pride,
and his old hate vnto you: besides, forget not
with what contempt he wore the humble weed,
how in his suit he scorn'd you: but your loues,
thinking vpon his seruices, tooke from you
th' apprehension of his present portance,
which most gibingly, vngrauely, he did fashion
after the inueterate hate he beares you

   brut. lay a fault on vs, your tribunes,
that we labour'd (no impediment betweene)
but that you must cast your election on him

   scici. say you chose him, more after our commandment,
then as guided by your owne true affections, and that
your minds pre-occupy'd with what you rather must do,
then what you should, made you against the graine
to voyce him consull. lay the fault on vs

   brut. i, spare vs not: say, we read lectures to you,
how youngly he began to serue his countrey,
how long continued, and what stock he springs of,
the noble house o'th'martians: from whence came
that ancus martius, numaes daughters sonne:
who after great hostilius here was king,
of the same house publius and quintus were,
that our best water, brought by conduits hither,
and nobly nam'd, so twice being censor,
was his great ancestor

   scicin. one thus descended,
that hath beside well in his person wrought,
to be set high in place, we did commend
to your remembrances: but you haue found,
skaling his present bearing with his past,
that hee's your fixed enemie; and reuoke
your suddaine approbation

   brut. say you ne're had don't,
(harpe on that still) but by our putting on:
and presently, when you haue drawne your number,
repaire toth' capitoll

   all. we will so: almost all repent in their election.

exeunt. plebeians.

  brut. let them goe on:
this mutinie were better put in hazard,
then stay past doubt, for greater:
if, as his nature is, he fall in rage
with their refusall, both obserue and answer
the vantage of his anger

   scicin. toth' capitoll, come:
we will be there before the streame o'th' people:
and this shall seeme, as partly 'tis, their owne,
which we haue goaded on-ward.

exeunt.


actus tertius.

cornets. enter coriolanus, menenius, all the gentry, cominius,
titus
latius, and other senators.

  corio. tullus auffidius then had made new head

   latius. he had, my lord, and that it was which caus'd
our swifter composition

   corio. so then the volces stand but as at first,
readie when time shall prompt them, to make roade
vpon's againe

   com. they are worne (lord consull) so,
that we shall hardly in our ages see
their banners waue againe

   corio. saw you auffidius?
  latius. on safegard he came to me, and did curse
against the volces, for they had so vildly
yeelded the towne: he is retyred to antium

   corio. spoke he of me?
  latius. he did, my lord

   corio. how? what?
  latius. how often he had met you sword to sword:
that of all things vpon the earth, he hated
your person most: that he would pawne his fortunes
to hopelesse restitution, so he might
be call'd your vanquisher

   corio. at antium liues he?
  latius. at antium

   corio. i wish i had a cause to seeke him there,
to oppose his hatred fully. welcome home.
enter scicinius and brutus.

behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
the tongues o'th' common mouth. i do despise them:
for they doe pranke them in authoritie,
against all noble sufferance

   scicin. passe no further

   cor. hah? what is that?
  brut. it will be dangerous to goe on- no further

   corio. what makes this change?
  menen. the matter?
  com. hath he not pass'd the noble, and the common?
  brut. cominius, no

   corio. haue i had childrens voyces?
  senat. tribunes giue way, he shall toth' market place

   brut. the people are incens'd against him

   scicin. stop, or all will fall in broyle

   corio. are these your heard?
must these haue voyces, that can yeeld them now,
and straight disclaim their toungs? what are your offices?
you being their mouthes, why rule you not their teeth?
haue you not set them on?
  mene. be calme, be calme

   corio. it is a purpos'd thing, and growes by plot,
to curbe the will of the nobilitie:
suffer't, and liue with such as cannot rule,
nor euer will be ruled

   brut. call't not a plot:
the people cry you mockt them: and of late,
when corne was giuen them gratis, you repin'd,
scandal'd the suppliants: for the people, call'd them
time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to noblenesse

   corio. why this was knowne before

   brut. not to them all

   corio. haue you inform'd them sithence?
  brut. how? i informe them?
  com. you are like to doe such businesse

   brut. not vnlike each way to better yours

   corio. why then should i be consull? by yond clouds
let me deserue so ill as you, and make me
your fellow tribune

   scicin. you shew too much of that,
for which the people stirre: if you will passe
to where you are bound, you must enquire your way,
which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
or neuer be so noble as a consull,
nor yoake with him for tribune

   mene. let's be calme

   com. the people are abus'd: set on, this paltring
becomes not rome: nor ha's coriolanus
deseru'd this so dishonor'd rub, layd falsely
i'th' plaine way of his merit

   corio. tell me of corne: this was my speech,
and i will speak't againe

   mene. not now, not now

   senat. not in this heat, sir, now

   corio. now as i liue, i will.
my nobler friends, i craue their pardons:
for the mutable ranke-sented meynie,
let them regard me, as i doe not flatter,
and therein behold themselues: i say againe,
in soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate
the cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
which we our selues haue plowed for, sow'd, & scatter'd,
by mingling them with vs, the honor'd number,
who lack not vertue, no, nor power, but that
which they haue giuen to beggers

   mene. well, no more

   senat. no more words, we beseech you

   corio. how? no more?
as for my country, i haue shed my blood,
not fearing outward force: so shall my lungs
coine words till their decay, against those meazels
which we disdaine should tetter vs, yet sought
the very way to catch them

   bru. you speake a'th' people, as if you were a god,
to punish; not a man, of their infirmity

   sicin. 'twere well we let the people know't

   mene. what, what? his choller?
  cor. choller? were i as patient as the midnight sleep,
by ioue, 'twould be my minde

   sicin. it is a minde that shall remain a poison
where it is: not poyson any further

   corio. shall remaine?
heare you this triton of the minnoues? marke you
his absolute shall?
  com. 'twas from the cannon

   cor. shall? o god! but most vnwise patricians: why
you graue, but wreaklesse senators, haue you thus
giuen hidra heere to choose an officer,
that with his peremptory shall, being but
the horne, and noise o'th' monsters, wants not spirit
to say, hee'l turne your current in a ditch,
and make your channell his? if he haue power,
then vale your ignorance: if none, awake
your dangerous lenity: if you are learn'd,
be not as common fooles; if you are not,
let them haue cushions by you. you are plebeians,
if they be senators: and they are no lesse,
when both your voices blended, the great'st taste
most pallates theirs. they choose their magistrate,
and such a one as he, who puts his shall,
his popular shall, against a grauer bench
then euer frown'd in greece. by ioue himselfe,
it makes the consuls base; and my soule akes
to know, when two authorities are vp,
neither supreame; how soone confusion
may enter 'twixt the gap of both, and take
the one by th' other

   com. well, on to'th' market place

   corio. who euer gaue that counsell, to giue forth
the corne a'th' store-house gratis, as 'twas vs'd
sometime in greece

   mene. well, well, no more of that

   cor. thogh there the people had more absolute powre
i say they norisht disobedience: fed, the ruin of the state

   bru. why shall the people giue
one that speakes thus, their voyce?
  corio. ile giue my reasons,
more worthier then their voyces. they know the corne
was not our recompence, resting well assur'd
they ne're did seruice for't; being prest to'th' warre,
euen when the nauell of the state was touch'd,
they would not thred the gates: this kinde of seruice
did not deserue corne gratis. being i'th' warre,
there mutinies and reuolts, wherein they shew'd
most valour spoke not for them. th' accusation
which they haue often made against the senate,
all cause vnborne, could neuer be the natiue
of our so franke donation. well, what then?
how shall this bosome-multiplied, digest
the senates courtesie? let deeds expresse
what's like to be their words, we did request it,
we are the greater pole, and in true feare
they gaue vs our demands. thus we debase
the nature of our seats, and make the rabble
call our cares, feares; which will in time
breake ope the lockes a'th' senate, and bring in
the crowes to pecke the eagles

   mene. come enough

   bru. enough, with ouer measure

   corio. no, take more.
what may be sworne by, both diuine and humane,
seale what i end withall. this double worship,
whereon part do's disdaine with cause, the other
insult without all reason: where gentry, title, wisedom
cannot conclude, but by the yea and no
of generall ignorance, it must omit
reall necessities, and giue way the while
to vnstable slightnesse. purpose so barr'd, it followes,
nothing is done to purpose. therefore beseech you,
you that will be lesse fearefull, then discreet,
that loue the fundamentall part of state
more then you doubt the change on't: that preferre
a noble life, before a long, and wish,
to iumpe a body with a dangerous physicke,
that's sure of death without it: at once plucke out
the multitudinous tongue, let them not licke
the sweet which is their poyson. your dishonor
mangles true iudgement, and bereaues the state
of that integrity which should becom't:
not hauing the power to do the good it would
for th' ill which doth controul't

   bru. has said enough

   sicin. ha's spoken like a traitor, and shall answer
as traitors do

   corio. thou wretch, despight ore-whelme thee:
what should the people do with these bald tribunes?
on whom depending, their obedience failes
to'th' greater bench, in a rebellion:
when what's not meet, but what must be, was law,
then were they chosen: in a better houre,
let what is meet, be saide it must be meet,
and throw their power i'th' dust

   bru. manifest treason

   sicin. this a consull? no.
enter an aedile.

  bru. the ediles hoe: let him be apprehended:
  sicin. go call the people, in whose name my selfe
attach thee as a traitorous innouator:
a foe to'th' publike weale. obey i charge thee,
and follow to thine answer

   corio. hence old goat

   all. wee'l surety him

   com. ag'd sir, hands off

   corio. hence rotten thing, or i shall shake thy bones
out of thy garments

   sicin. helpe ye citizens.
enter a rabble of plebeians with the aediles.

  mene. on both sides more respect

   sicin. heere's hee, that would take from you all your
power

   bru. seize him aediles

   2 sen. weapons, weapons, weapons:

they all bustle about coriolanus.

tribunes, patricians, citizens: what ho:
sicinius, brutus, coriolanus, citizens

   all. peace, peace, peace, stay, hold, peace

   mene. what is about to be? i am out of breath,
confusions neere, i cannot speake. you, tribunes
to'th' people: coriolanus, patience: speak good sicinius

   scici. heare me, people peace

   all. let's here our tribune: peace, speake, speake,
speake

   scici. you are at point to lose your liberties:
martius would haue all from you; martius,
whom late you haue nam'd for consull

   mene. fie, fie, fie, this is the way to kindle, not to
quench

   sena. to vnbuild the citie, and to lay all flat

   scici. what is the citie, but the people?
  all. true, the people are the citie

   brut. by the consent of all, we were establish'd the
peoples magistrates

   all. you so remaine

   mene. and so are like to doe

   com. that is the way to lay the citie flat,
to bring the roofe to the foundation,
and burie all, which yet distinctly raunges
in heapes, and piles of ruine

   scici. this deserues death

   brut. or let vs stand to our authoritie,
or let vs lose it: we doe here pronounce,
vpon the part o'th' people, in whose power
we were elected theirs, martius is worthy
of present death

   scici. therefore lay hold of him:
beare him toth' rock tarpeian, and from thence
into destruction cast him

   brut. aediles seize him

   all ple. yeeld martius, yeeld

   mene. heare me one word, 'beseech you tribunes,
heare me but a word

   aediles. peace, peace

   mene. be that you seeme, truly your countries friend,
and temp'rately proceed to what you would
thus violently redresse

   brut. sir, those cold wayes,
that seeme like prudent helpes, are very poysonous,
where the disease is violent. lay hands vpon him,
and beare him to the rock.

corio. drawes his sword.

  corio. no, ile die here:
there's some among you haue beheld me fighting,
come trie vpon your selues, what you haue seene me

   mene. downe with that sword, tribunes withdraw
a while

   brut. lay hands vpon him

   mene. helpe martius, helpe: you that be noble, helpe
him young and old

   all. downe with him, downe with him.

exeunt.

in this mutinie, the tribunes, the aediles, and the people are beat
in.

  mene. goe, get you to our house: be gone, away.
all will be naught else

   2.sena. get you gone

   com. stand fast, we haue as many friends as enemies

   mene. shall it be put to that?
  sena. the gods forbid:
i prythee noble friend, home to thy house,
leaue vs to cure this cause

   mene. for 'tis a sore vpon vs,
you cannot tent your selfe: be gone, 'beseech you

   corio. come sir, along with vs

   mene. i would they were barbarians, as they are,
though in rome litter'd: not romans, as they are not,
though calued i'th' porch o'th' capitoll:
be gone, put not your worthy rage into your tongue,
one time will owe another

   corio. on faire ground, i could beat fortie of them

   mene. i could my selfe take vp a brace o'th' best of
them, yea, the two tribunes

   com. but now 'tis oddes beyond arithmetick,
and manhood is call'd foolerie, when it stands
against a falling fabrick. will you hence,
before the tagge returne? whose rage doth rend
like interrupted waters, and o're-beare
what they are vs'd to beare

   mene. pray you be gone:
ile trie whether my old wit be in request
with those that haue but little: this must be patcht
with cloth of any colour

   com. nay, come away.

exeunt. coriolanus and cominius.

  patri. this man ha's marr'd his fortune

   mene. his nature is too noble for the world:
he would not flatter neptune for his trident,
or ioue, for's power to thunder: his heart's his mouth:
what his brest forges, that his tongue must vent,
and being angry, does forget that euer
he heard the name of death.

a noise within.

here's goodly worke

   patri. i would they were a bed

   mene. i would they were in tyber.
what the vengeance, could he not speake 'em faire?
enter brutus and sicinius with the rabble againe.

  sicin. where is this viper,
that would depopulate the city, & be euery man himself
  mene. you worthy tribunes

   sicin. he shall be throwne downe the tarpeian rock
with rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,
and therefore law shall scorne him further triall
then the seuerity of the publike power,
which he so sets at naught

   1 cit. he shall well know the noble tribunes are
the peoples mouths, and we their hands

   all. he shall sure ont

with modest warrant

   sicin. sir, how com'st that you haue holpe
to make this rescue?
  mene. heere me speake? as i do know
the consuls worthinesse, so can i name his faults

   sicin. consull? what consull?
  mene. the consull coriolanus

   bru. he consull

   all. no, no, no, no, no

   mene. if by the tribunes leaue,
and yours good people,
i may be heard, i would craue a word or two,
the which shall turne you to no further harme,
then so much losse of time

   sic. speake breefely then,
for we are peremptory to dispatch
this viporous traitor: to eiect him hence
were but one danger, and to keepe him heere
our certaine death: therefore it is decreed,
he dyes to night

   menen. now the good gods forbid,
that our renowned rome, whose gratitude
towards her deserued children, is enroll'd
in ioues owne booke, like an vnnaturall dam
should now eate vp her owne

   sicin. he's a disease that must be cut away

   mene. oh he's a limbe, that ha's but a disease
mortall, to cut it off: to cure it, easie.
what ha's he done to rome, that's worthy death?
killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost
(which i dare vouch, is more then that he hath
by many an ounce) he dropp'd it for his country:
and what is left, to loose it by his countrey,
were to vs all that doo't, and suffer it
a brand to th' end a'th world

   sicin. this is cleane kamme

   brut. meerely awry:
when he did loue his country, it honour'd him

   menen. the seruice of the foote
being once gangren'd, is not then respected
for what before it was

   bru. wee'l heare no more:
pursue him to his house, and plucke him thence,
least his infection being of catching nature,
spred further

   menen. one word more, one word:
this tiger-footed-rage, when it shall find
the harme of vnskan'd swiftnesse, will (too late)
tye leaden pounds too's heeles. proceed by processe,
least parties (as he is belou'd) breake out,
and sacke great rome with romanes

   brut. if it were so?
  sicin. what do ye talke?
haue we not had a taste of his obedience?
our ediles smot: our selues resisted: come

   mene. consider this: he ha's bin bred i'th' warres
since a could draw a sword, and is ill-school'd
in boulted language: meale and bran together
he throwes without distinction. giue me leaue,
ile go to him, and vndertake to bring him in peace,
where he shall answer by a lawfull forme
(in peace) to his vtmost perill

   1.sen. noble tribunes,

will proue to bloody: and the end of it,
vnknowne to the beginning

   sic. noble menenius, be you then as the peoples officer:
masters, lay downe your weapons

   bru. go not home

   sic. meet on the market place: wee'l attend you there:
where if you bring not martius, wee'l proceede
in our first way

   menen. ile bring him to you.
let me desire your company: he must come,
or what is worst will follow

   sena. pray you let's to him.

exeunt. omnes.

enter coriolanus with nobles.

  corio. let them pull all about mine eares, present me
death on the wheele, or at wilde horses heeles,

below the beame of sight; yet will i still
be thus to them.

do's not approue me further, who was wont
to call them wollen vassailes, things created
to buy and sell with groats, to shew bare heads
in congregations, to yawne, be still, and wonder,
when one but of my ordinance stood vp
to speake of peace, or warre. i talke of you,
why did you wish me milder? would you haue me
false to my nature? rather say, i play
the man i am

i would haue had you put your power well on
before you had worne it out

the violent fit a'th' time craues it as physicke
for the whole state; i would put mine armour on,
which i can scarsely beare

  mene. returne to th' tribunes

   corio. well, what then? what then?
  mene. repent, what you haue spoke

   corio. for them, i cannot do it to the gods,
must i then doo't to them?
  volum. you are too absolute,
though therein you can neuer be too noble,
but when extremities speake. i haue heard you say,
honor and policy, like vnseuer'd friends,
i'th' warre do grow together: grant that, and tell me
in peace, what each of them by th' other loose,
that they combine not there?
  corio. tush, tush

   mene. a good demand

   volum. if it be honor in your warres, to seeme
the same you are not, which for your best ends
you adopt your policy: how is it lesse or worse
that it shall hold companionship in peace
with honour, as in warre; since that to both
it stands in like request

   corio. why force you this?
  volum. because, that
now it lyes you on to speake to th' people:
not by your owne instruction, nor by'th' matter
which your heart prompts you, but with such words
that are but roated in your tongue;
though but bastards, and syllables
of no allowance, to your bosomes truth.
now, this no more dishonors you at all,
then to take in a towne with gentle words,
which else would put you to your fortune, and
the hazard of much blood.
i would dissemble with my nature, where
my fortunes and my friends at stake, requir'd
i should do so in honor. i am in this
your wife, your sonne: these senators, the nobles,
and you, will rather shew our generall lowts,
how you can frowne, then spend a fawne vpon 'em,
for the inheritance of their loues, and safegard
of what that want might ruine

   menen. noble lady,
come goe with vs, speake faire: you may salue so,
not what is dangerous present, but the losse
of what is past

   volum. i prythee now, my sonne,
goe to them, with this bonnet in thy hand,
and thus farre hauing stretcht it (here be with them)
thy knee bussing the stones: for in such businesse
action is eloquence, and the eyes of th' ignorant
more learned then the eares, wauing thy head,
which often thus correcting thy stout heart,
now humble as the ripest mulberry,
that will not hold the handling: or say to them,
thou art their souldier, and being bred in broyles,
hast not the soft way, which thou do'st confesse
were fit for thee to vse, as they to clayme,
in asking their good loues, but thou wilt frame
thy selfe (forsooth) hereafter theirs so farre,
as thou hast power and person

   menen. this but done,
euen as she speakes, why their hearts were yours:
for they haue pardons, being ask'd, as free,
as words to little purpose

follow thine enemie in a fierie gulfe,
then flatter him in a bower.

this mould of martius, they to dust should grinde it,
and throw't against the winde. toth' market place:

my praises made thee first a souldier; so
to haue my praise for this, performe a part
thou hast not done before

   corio. well, i must doo't:
away my disposition, and possesse me
some harlots spirit: my throat of warre be turn'd,
which quier'd with my drumme into a pipe,
small as an eunuch, or the virgin voyce
that babies lull a-sleepe: the smiles of knaues
tent in my cheekes, and schoole-boyes teares take vp
the glasses of my sight: a beggars tongue
make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees
who bow'd but in my stirrop, bend like his
that hath receiu'd an almes. i will not doo't,

why speak'st not? speake man: what's thy name?

and harsh in sound to thine

   auf. say, what's thy name?
thou hast a grim apparance, and thy face
beares a command in't: though thy tackles torne,
thou shew'st a noble vessell: what's thy name?
  corio. prepare thy brow to frowne: knowst y me yet?
  auf. i know thee not? thy name:
  corio. my name is caius martius, who hath done
to thee particularly, and to all the volces
great hurt and mischiefe: thereto witnesse may
my surname coriolanus. the painfull seruice,
the extreme dangers, and the droppes of blood
shed for my thanklesse country, are requitted:
but with that surname, a good memorie
and witnesse of the malice and displeasure
which thou should'st beare me, only that name remains.
the cruelty and enuy of the people,
permitted by our dastard nobles, who
haue all forsooke me, hath deuour'd the rest:
and suffer'd me by th' voyce of slaues to be
hoop'd out of rome. now this extremity,
hath brought me to thy harth, not out of hope
(mistake me not) to saue my life: for if
i had fear'd death, of all the men i'th' world
i would haue voided thee. but in meere spight
to be full quit of those my banishers,
stand i before thee heere: then if thou hast
a heart of wreake in thee, that wilt reuenge
thine owne particular wrongs, and stop those maimes
of shame seene through thy country, speed thee straight
and make my misery serue thy turne: so vse it,
that my reuengefull seruices may proue
as benefits to thee. for i will fight
against my cankred countrey, with the spleene
of all the vnder fiends. but if so be,
thou dar'st not this, and that to proue more fortunes
th'art tyr'd, then in a word, i also am
longer to liue most wearie: and present
my throat to thee, and to thy ancient malice:
which not to cut, would shew thee but a foole,
since i haue euer followed thee with hate,
drawne tunnes of blood out of thy countries brest,
and cannot liue but to thy shame, vnlesse
it be to do thee seruice

   auf. oh martius, martius;
each word thou hast spoke, hath weeded from my heart
a roote of ancient enuy. if iupiter
should from yond clowd speake diuine things,
and say 'tis true; i'de not beleeue them more
then thee all-noble martius. let me twine
mine armes about that body, where against
my grained ash an hundred times hath broke,
and scarr'd the moone with splinters: heere i cleep
the anuile of my sword, and do contest
as hotly, and as nobly with thy loue,
as euer in ambitious strength, i did
contend against thy valour. know thou first,
i lou'd the maid i married: neuer man
sigh'd truer breath. but that i see thee heere
thou noble thing, more dances my rapt heart,
then when i first my wedded mistris saw
bestride my threshold. why, thou mars i tell thee,
we haue a power on foote: and i had purpose
once more to hew thy target from thy brawne,
or loose mine arme for't: thou hast beate mee out
twelue seuerall times, and i haue nightly since
dreamt of encounters 'twixt thy selfe and me:
we haue beene downe together in my sleepe,
vnbuckling helmes, fisting each others throat,
and wak'd halfe dead with nothing. worthy martius,
had we no other quarrell else to rome, but that
thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
from twelue, to seuentie: and powring warre
into the bowels of vngratefull rome,
like a bold flood o're-beate. oh come, go in,
and take our friendly senators by'th' hands
who now are heere, taking their leaues of mee,
who am prepar'd against your territories,
though not for rome it selfe

   corio. you blesse me gods

   auf. therefore most absolute sir, if thou wilt haue
the leading of thine owne reuenges, take
th' one halfe of my commission, and set downe
as best thou art experienc'd, since thou know'st
thy countries strength and weaknesse, thine own waies
whether to knocke against the gates of rome,
or rudely visit them in parts remote,
to fright them, ere destroy. but come in,
let me commend thee first, to those that shall
say yea to thy desires. a thousand welcomes,
and more a friend, then ere an enemie,
yet martius that was much. your hand: most welcome.

exeunt.

enter two of the seruingmen.

  1 heere's a strange alteration?
  2 by my hand, i had thoght to haue stroken him with
a cudgell, and yet my minde gaue me, his cloathes made
a false report of him

   1 what an arme he has, he turn'd me about with his
finger and his thumbe, as one would set vp a top

   2 nay, i knew by his face that there was some-thing
in him. he had sir, a kinde of face me thought, i cannot
tell how to tearme it

   1 he had so, looking as it were, would i were hang'd
but i thought there was more in him, then i could think

   2 so did i, ile be sworne: he is simply the rarest man
i'th' world

   1 i thinke he is: but a greater soldier then he,
you wot one

   2 who my master?
  1 nay, it's no matter for that

   2 worth six on him

   1 nay not so neither: but i take him to be the greater
souldiour

   2 faith looke you, one cannot tell how to say that: for
the defence of a towne, our generall is excellent

   1 i, and for an assault too.
enter the third seruingman.

  3 oh slaues, i can tell you newes, news you rascals
  both. what, what, what? let's partake

   3 i would not be a roman of all nations; i had as
liue be a condemn'd man

   both. wherefore? wherefore?
  3 why here's he that was wont to thwacke our generall,
caius martius

   1 why do you say, thwacke our generall?
  3 i do not say thwacke our generall, but he was alwayes
good enough for him
  2 come we are fellowes and friends: he was euer too
hard for him, i haue heard him say so himselfe

   1 he was too hard for him directly, to say the troth
on't before corioles, he scotcht him, and notcht him like a
carbinado

   2 and hee had bin cannibally giuen, hee might haue
boyld and eaten him too

   1 but more of thy newes

   3 why he is so made on heere within, as if hee were
son and heire to mars, set at vpper end o'th' table: no
question askt him by any of the senators, but they stand
bald before him. our generall himselfe makes a mistris
of him, sanctifies himselfe with's hand, and turnes vp the
white o'th' eye to his discourse. but the bottome of the
newes is, our generall is cut i'th' middle, & but one halfe
of what he was yesterday. for the other ha's halfe, by
the intreaty and graunt of the whole table. hee'l go he
sayes, and sole the porter of rome gates by th' eares. he
will mowe all downe before him, and leaue his passage
poul'd

   2 and he's as like to do't, as any man i can imagine

   3 doo't? he will doo't: for look you sir, he has as many
friends as enemies: which friends sir as it were, durst
not (looke you sir) shew themselues (as we terme it) his
friends, whilest he's in directitude

   1 directitude? what's that?
  3 but when they shall see sir, his crest vp againe, and
the man in blood, they will out of their burroughes (like
conies after raine) and reuell all with him

   1 but when goes this forward:
  3 to morrow, to day, presently, you shall haue the
drum strooke vp this afternoone: 'tis as it were a parcel
of their feast, and to be executed ere they wipe their lips

   2 why then wee shall haue a stirring world againe:
this peace is nothing, but to rust iron, encrease taylors,
and breed ballad-makers

   1 let me haue warre say i, it exceeds peace as farre
as day do's night: it's sprightly walking, audible, and full
of vent. peace, is a very apoplexy, lethargie, mull'd,
deafe, sleepe, insensible, a getter of more bastard children,
then warres a destroyer of men

   2 'tis so, and as warres in some sort may be saide to
be a rauisher, so it cannot be denied, but peace is a great
maker of cuckolds

   1 i, and it makes men hate one another

   3 reason, because they then lesse neede one another:
the warres for my money. i hope to see romanes as
cheape as volcians. they are rising, they are rising

   both. in, in, in, in.

exeunt.

enter the two tribunes, sicinius, and brutus.

  sicin. we heare not of him, neither need we fear him,
his remedies are tame, the present peace,
and quietnesse of the people, which before
were in wilde hurry. heere do we make his friends
blush, that the world goes well: who rather had,
though they themselues did suffer by't, behold
dissentious numbers pestring streets, then see
our tradesmen singing in their shops, and going
about their functions friendly.
enter menenius.

  bru. we stood too't in good time. is this menenius?
  sicin. 'tis he, 'tis he: o he is grown most kind of late:
haile sir

   mene. haile to you both

   sicin. your coriolanus is not much mist, but with his
friends: the commonwealth doth stand, and so would
do, were he more angry at it

   mene. all's well, and might haue bene much better,
if he could haue temporiz'd

   sicin. where is he, heare you?
  mene. nay i heare nothing:
his mother and his wife, heare nothing from him.
enter three or foure citizens.

  all. the gods preserue you both

   sicin. gooden our neighbours

   bru. gooden to you all, gooden to you all

   1 our selues, our wiues, and children, on our knees,
are bound to pray for you both

   sicin. liue, and thriue

   bru. farewell kinde neighbours:
we wisht coriolanus had lou'd you as we did

   all. now the gods keepe you

   both tri. farewell, farewell.

exeunt. citizens

  sicin. this is a happier and more comely time,
then when these fellowes ran about the streets,
crying confusion

   bru. caius martius was
a worthy officer i'th' warre, but insolent,
o'recome with pride, ambitious, past all thinking
selfe-louing

   sicin. and affecting one sole throne, without assista[n]ce
  mene. i thinke not so

   sicin. we should by this, to all our lamention,
if he had gone forth consull, found it so

   bru. the gods haue well preuented it, and rome
sits safe and still, without him.
enter an aedile.

  aedile. worthy tribunes,
there is a slaue whom we haue put in prison,
reports the volces with two seuerall powers
are entred in the roman territories,
and with the deepest malice of the warre,
destroy, what lies before' em

   mene. 'tis auffidius,
who hearing of our martius banishment,
thrusts forth his hornes againe into the world
which were in-shell'd, when martius stood for rome,
and durst not once peepe out

   sicin. come, what talke you of martius

   bru. go see this rumorer whipt, it cannot be,
the volces dare breake with vs

   mene. cannot be?
we haue record, that very well it can,
and three examples of the like, hath beene
within my age. but reason with the fellow
before you punish him, where he heard this,
least you shall chance to whip your information,
and beate the messenger, who bids beware
of what is to be dreaded

   sicin. tell not me: i know this cannot be

   bru. not possible.
enter a messenger.

  mes. the nobles in great earnestnesse are going
all to the senate-house: some newes is comming
that turnes their countenances

   sicin. 'tis this slaue:
go whip him fore the peoples eyes: his raising,
nothing but his report

   mes. yes worthy sir,
the slaues report is seconded, and more
more fearfull is deliuer'd

   sicin. what more fearefull?
  mes. it is spoke freely out of many mouths,
how probable i do not know, that martius
ioyn'd with auffidius, leads a power 'gainst rome,
and vowes reuenge as spacious, as betweene
the yong'st and oldest thing

   sicin. this is most likely

   bru. rais'd onely, that the weaker sort may wish
good martius home againe

   sicin. the very tricke on't

   mene. this is vnlikely,
he, and auffidius can no more attone
then violent'st contrariety.
enter messenger.

  mes. you are sent for to the senate:
a fearefull army, led by caius martius,
associated with auffidius, rages
vpon our territories, and haue already
o're-borne their way, consum'd with fire, and tooke
what lay before them.
enter cominius.

  com. oh you haue made good worke

   mene. what newes? what newes?
  com. you haue holp to rauish your owne daughters, &
to melt the citty leades vpon your pates,
to see your wiues dishonour'd to your noses

   mene. what's the newes? what's the newes?
  com. your temples burned in their ciment, and
your franchises, whereon you stood, confin'd
into an augors boare

   mene. pray now, your newes:
you haue made faire worke i feare me: pray your newes,
if martius should be ioyn'd with volceans

   com. if? he is their god, he leads them like a thing
made by some other deity then nature,
that shapes man better: and they follow him
against vs brats, with no lesse confidence,
then boyes pursuing summer butter-flies,
or butchers killing flyes

   mene. you haue made good worke,
you and your apron men: you, that stood so much
vpon the voyce of occupation, and
the breath of garlicke-eaters

   com. hee'l shake your rome about your eares

   mene. as hercules did shake downe mellow fruite:
you haue made faire worke

   brut. but is this true sir?
  com. i, and you'l looke pale
before you finde it other. all the regions
do smilingly reuolt, and who resists
are mock'd for valiant ignorance,
and perish constant fooles: who is't can blame him?
your enemies and his, finde something in him

   mene. we are all vndone, vnlesse
the noble man haue mercy

   com. who shall aske it?
the tribunes cannot doo't for shame; the people
deserue such pitty of him, as the wolfe
doe's of the shepheards: for his best friends, if they
should say be good to rome, they charg'd him, euen
as those should do that had deseru'd his hate,
and therein shew'd like enemies

   me. 'tis true, if he were putting to my house, the brand
that should consume it, i haue not the face
to say, beseech you cease. you haue made faire hands,
you and your crafts, you haue crafted faire

   com. you haue brought
a trembling vpon rome, such as was neuer
s' incapeable of helpe

   tri. say not, we brought it

   mene. how? was't we? we lou'd him,
but like beasts, and cowardly nobles,
gaue way vnto your clusters, who did hoote
him out o'th' citty

   com. but i feare
they'l roare him in againe. tullus affidius,
the second name of men, obeyes his points
as if he were his officer: desperation,
is all the policy, strength, and defence
that rome can make against them.
enter a troope of citizens.

  mene. heere come the clusters.
and is auffidius with him? you are they
that made the ayre vnwholsome, when you cast
your stinking, greasie caps, in hooting
at coriolanus exile. now he's comming,
and not a haire vpon a souldiers head
which will not proue a whip: as many coxcombes
as you threw caps vp, will he tumble downe,
and pay you for your voyces. 'tis no matter,
if he could burne vs all into one coale,
we haue deseru'd it

   omnes. faith, we heare fearfull newes

   1 cit. for mine owne part,
when i said banish him, i said 'twas pitty

   2 and so did i

   3 and so did i: and to say the truth, so did very many
of vs, that we did we did for the best, and though wee
willingly consented to his banishment, yet it was against
our will

   com. y'are goodly things, you voyces

   mene. you haue made good worke
you and your cry. shal's to the capitoll?
  com. oh i, what else?

exeunt. both.

  sicin. go masters get you home, be not dismaid,
these are a side, that would be glad to haue
this true, which they so seeme to feare. go home,
and shew no signe of feare

   1 cit. the gods bee good to vs: come masters let's
home, i euer said we were i'th wrong, when we banish'd
him

   2 cit. so did we all. but come, let's home.

exit cit.

  bru. i do not like this newes

   sicin. nor i

   bru. let's to the capitoll: would halfe my wealth
would buy this for a lye

   sicin. pray let's go.

exeunt. tribunes.

enter auffidius with his lieutenant.

  auf. do they still flye to'th' roman?
  lieu. i do not know what witchcraft's in him: but
your soldiers vse him as the grace 'fore meate,
their talke at table, and their thankes at end,
and you are darkned in this action sir,
euen by your owne

   auf. i cannot helpe it now,
vnlesse by vsing meanes i lame the foote
of our designe. he beares himselfe more proudlier,
euen to my person, then i thought he would
when first i did embrace him. yet his nature
in that's no changeling, and i must excuse
what cannot be amended

   lieu. yet i wish sir,
(i meane for your particular) you had not
ioyn'd in commission with him: but either haue borne
the action of your selfe, or else to him, had left it soly

   auf. i vnderstand thee well, and be thou sure
when he shall come to his account, he knowes not
what i can vrge against him, although it seemes
and so he thinkes, and is no lesse apparant
to th' vulgar eye, that he beares all things fairely:
and shewes good husbandry for the volcian state,
fights dragon-like, and does atcheeue as soone
as draw his sword: yet he hath left vndone
that which shall breake his necke, or hazard mine,
when ere we come to our account

   lieu. sir, i beseech you, think you he'l carry rome?
  auf. all places yeelds to him ere he sits downe,
and the nobility of rome are his:
the senators and patricians loue him too:
the tribunes are no soldiers: and their people
will be as rash in the repeale, as hasty
to expell him thence. i thinke hee'l be to rome
as is the aspray to the fish, who takes it
by soueraignty of nature. first, he was
a noble seruant to them, but he could not
carry his honors eeuen: whether 'twas pride
which out of dayly fortune euer taints
the happy man; whether detect of iudgement,
to faile in the disposing of those chances
which he was lord of: or whether nature,
not to be other then one thing, not moouing
from th' caske to th' cushion: but commanding peace
euen with the same austerity and garbe,
as he controll'd the warre. but one of these
(as he hath spices of them all) not all,
for i dare so farre free him, made him fear'd,
so hated, and so banish'd: but he ha's a merit
to choake it in the vtt'rance: so our vertue,
lie in th' interpretation of the time,
and power vnto it selfe most commendable,
hath not a tombe so euident as a chaire
t' extoll what it hath done.
one fire driues out one fire; one naile, one naile;
rights by rights fouler, strengths by strengths do faile.
come let's away: when caius rome is thine,
thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.

exeunt.

actus quintus.

enter menenius, cominius, sicinius, brutus, the two tribunes,
with
others.

  menen. no, ile not go: you heare what he hath said
which was sometime his generall: who loued him
in a most deere particular. he call'd me father:
but what o'that? go you that banish'd him
a mile before his tent, fall downe, and knee
the way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd
to heare cominius speake, ile keepe at home

   com. he would not seeme to know me

   menen. do you heare?
  com. yet one time he did call me by my name:
i vrg'd our old acquaintance, and the drops
that we haue bled together. coriolanus
he would not answer too: forbad all names,
he was a kinde of nothing, titlelesse,
till he had forg'd himselfe a name a'th' fire
of burning rome

   menen. why so: you haue made good worke:
a paire of tribunes, that haue wrack'd for rome,
to make coales cheape: a noble memory

   com. i minded him, how royall 'twas to pardon
when it was lesse expected. he replyed
it was a bare petition of a state
to one whom they had punish'd

   menen. very well, could he say lesse

   com. i offered to awaken his regard
for's priuate friends. his answer to me was
he could not stay to picke them, in a pile
of noysome musty chaffe. he said, 'twas folly
for one poore graine or two, to leaue vnburnt
and still to nose th' offence

   menen. for one poore graine or two?
i am one of those: his mother, wife, his childe,
and this braue fellow too: we are the graines,
you are the musty chaffe, and you are smelt
aboue the moone. we must be burnt for you

   sicin. nay, pray be patient: if you refuse your ayde
in this so neuer-needed helpe, yet do not
vpbraid's with our distresse. but sure if you
would be your countries pleader, your good tongue
more then the instant armie we can make
might stop our countryman

   mene. no: ile not meddle

   sicin. pray you go to him

   mene. what should i do?
  bru. onely make triall what your loue can do,
for rome, towards martius

   mene. well, and say that martius returne mee,
as cominius is return'd, vnheard: what then?
but as a discontented friend, greefe-shot
with his vnkindnesse. say't be so?
  sicin. yet your good will
must haue that thankes from rome, after the measure
as you intended well

   mene. ile vndertak't:
i thinke hee'l heare me. yet to bite his lip,
and humme at good cominius, much vnhearts mee.
he was not taken well, he had not din'd,
the veines vnfill'd, our blood is cold, and then
we powt vpon the morning, are vnapt
to giue or to forgiue; but when we haue stufft
these pipes, and these conueyances of our blood
with wine and feeding, we haue suppler soules
then in our priest-like fasts: therefore ile watch him
till he be dieted to my request,
and then ile set vpon him

   bru. you know the very rode into his kindnesse,
and cannot lose your way

   mene. good faith ile proue him,
speed how it will. i shall ere long, haue knowledge
of my successe.
enter.

  com. hee'l neuer heare him

   sicin. not

   com. i tell you, he doe's sit in gold, his eye
red as 'twould burne rome: and his iniury
the gaoler to his pitty. i kneel'd before him,
'twas very faintly he said rise: dismist me
thus with his speechlesse hand. what he would do
he sent in writing after me: what he would not,
bound with an oath to yeeld to his conditions:
so that all hope is vaine, vnlesse his noble mother,
and his wife, who (as i heare) meane to solicite him
for mercy to his countrey: therefore let's hence,
and with our faire intreaties hast them on.

exeunt.

enter menenius to the watch or guard.

  1.wat. stay: whence are you

   2.wat. stand, and go backe

   me. you guard like men, 'tis well. but by your leaue,
i am an officer of state, & come to speak with coriolanus
  1 from whence?
  mene. from rome

   i you may not passe, you must returne: our generall
will no more heare from thence

   2 you'l see your rome embrac'd with fire, before
you'l speake with coriolanus

   mene. good my friends,
if you haue heard your generall talke of rome,
and of his friends there, it is lots to blankes,
my name hath touch't your eares: it is menenius

   1 be it so, go back: the vertue of your name,
is not heere passable

   mene. i tell thee fellow,
thy generall is my louer: i haue beene
the booke of his good acts, whence men haue read
his fame vnparalell'd, happely amplified:
for i haue euer verified my friends,
(of whom hee's cheefe) with all the size that verity
would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,
like to a bowle vpon a subtle ground
i haue tumbled past the throw: and in his praise
haue (almost) stampt the leasing. therefore fellow,
i must haue leaue to passe

   1 faith sir, if you had told as many lies in his behalfe,
as you haue vttered words in your owne, you should not
passe heere: no, though it were as vertuous to lye, as to
liue chastly. therefore go backe

   men. prythee fellow, remember my name is menenius,
alwayes factionary on the party of your generall

   2 howsoeuer you haue bin his lier, as you say you
haue, i am one that telling true vnder him, must say you
cannot passe. therefore go backe

   mene. ha's he din'd can'st thou tell? for i would not
speake with him, till after dinner

   1 you are a roman, are you?
  mene. i am as thy generall is

   1 then you should hate rome, as he do's. can you,
when you haue pusht out your gates, the very defender
of them, and in a violent popular ignorance, giuen your
enemy your shield, thinke to front his reuenges with the
easie groanes of old women, the virginall palms of your
daughters, or with the palsied intercession of such a decay'd
dotant as you seeme to be? can you think to blow
out the intended fire, your city is ready to flame in, with
such weake breath as this? no, you are deceiu'd, therfore
backe to rome, and prepare for your execution: you are
condemn'd, our generall has sworne you out of repreeue
and pardon

   mene. sirra, if thy captaine knew i were heere,
he would vse me with estimation

   1 come, my captaine knowes you not

   mene. i meane thy generall

   1 my generall cares not for you. back i say, go: least
i let forth your halfe pinte of blood. backe, that's the vtmost
of your hauing, backe

   mene. nay but fellow, fellow.
enter coriolanus with auffidius.

  corio. what's the matter?
  mene. now you companion: ile say an arrant for you:
you shall know now that i am in estimation: you shall
perceiue, that a iacke gardant cannot office me from my
son coriolanus, guesse but my entertainment with him: if
thou stand'st not i'th state of hanging, or of some death
more long in spectatorship, and crueller in suffering, behold
now presently, and swoond for what's to come vpon
thee. the glorious gods sit in hourely synod about thy
particular prosperity, and loue thee no worse then thy old
father menenius do's. o my son, my son! thou art preparing
fire for vs: looke thee, heere's water to quench it.
i was hardly moued to come to thee: but beeing assured
none but my selfe could moue thee, i haue bene blowne
out of your gates with sighes: and coniure thee to pardon
rome, and thy petitionary countrimen. the good
gods asswage thy wrath, and turne the dregs of it, vpon
this varlet heere: this, who like a blocke hath denyed
my accesse to thee

   corio. away

   mene. how? away?
  corio. wife, mother, child, i know not. my affaires
are seruanted to others: though i owe
my reuenge properly, my remission lies
in volcean brests. that we haue beene familiar,
ingrate forgetfulnesse shall poison rather
then pitty: note how much, therefore be gone.
mine eares against your suites, are stronger then
your gates against my force. yet for i loued thee,
take this along, i writ it for thy sake,
and would haue sent it. another word menenius,
i will not heare thee speake. this man auffidius
was my belou'd in rome: yet thou behold'st

   auffid. you keepe a constant temper.

exeunt.

manet the guard and menenius.

  1 now sir, is your name menenius?
  2 'tis a spell you see of much power:
you know the way home againe

   1 do you heare how wee are shent for keeping your
greatnesse backe?
  2 what cause do you thinke i haue to swoond?
  menen. i neither care for th' world, nor your general:
for such things as you. i can scarse thinke ther's any, y'are
so slight. he that hath a will to die by himselfe, feares it
not from another: let your generall do his worst. for
you, bee that you are, long; and your misery encrease
with your age. i say to you, as i was said to, away.

  corio. we will before the walls of rome to morrow
set downe our hoast. my partner in this action,
you must report to th' volcian lords, how plainly
i haue borne this businesse

   auf. onely their ends you haue respected,
stopt your eares against the generall suite of rome:
neuer admitted a priuat whisper, no not with such frends
that thought them sure of you

   corio. this last old man,
whom with a crack'd heart i haue sent to rome,
lou'd me, aboue the measure of a father,
nay godded me indeed. their latest refuge
was to send him: for whose old loue i haue
(though i shew'd sowrely to him) once more offer'd
the first conditions which they did refuse,
and cannot now accept, to grace him onely,
that thought he could do more: a very little
i haue yeelded too. fresh embasses, and suites,
nor from the state, nor priuate friends heereafter
will i lend eare to. ha? what shout is this?

shout within

shall i be tempted to infringe my vow
in the same time 'tis made? i will not.
enter virgilia, volumnia, valeria, yong martius, with attendants.

my wife comes formost, then the honour'd mould
wherein this trunke was fram'd, and in her hand
the grandchilde to her blood. but out affection,
all bond and priuiledge of nature breake;
let it be vertuous to be obstinate.
what is that curt'sie worth? or those doues eyes,
which can make gods forsworne? i melt, and am not
of stronger earth then others: my mother bowes,
as if olympus to a mole-hill should
in supplication nod: and my yong boy
hath an aspect of intercession, which
great nature cries, deny not. let the volces
plough rome, and harrow italy, ile neuer
be such a gosling to obey instinct; but stand
as if a man were author of himself, & knew no other kin
  virgil. my lord and husband

   corio. these eyes are not the same i wore in rome

   virg. the sorrow that deliuers vs thus chang'd,
makes you thinke so

   corio. like a dull actor now, i haue forgot my part,
and i am out, euen to a full disgrace. best of my flesh,
forgiue my tyranny: but do not say,
for that forgiue our romanes. o a kisse
long as my exile, sweet as my reuenge!
now by the iealous queene of heauen, that kisse
i carried from thee deare; and my true lippe
hath virgin'd it ere since. you gods, i pray,

leaue vnsaluted: sinke my knee i'th' earth,

whil'st with no softer cushion then the flint
i kneele before thee, and vnproperly
shew duty as mistaken, all this while,

to your corrected sonne?
then let the pibbles on the hungry beach
fillop the starres: then, let the mutinous windes

or if you'ld aske, remember this before;
the thing i haue forsworne to graunt, may neuer
be held by you denials. do not bid me
dismisse my soldiers, or capitulate
againe, with romes mechanickes. tell me not
wherein i seeme vnnaturall: desire not t' allay
my rages and reuenges, with your colder reasons

   volum. oh no more, no more:
you haue said you will not grant vs any thing:
for we haue nothing else to aske, but that
which you deny already: yet we will aske,
that if you faile in our request, the blame
may hang vpon your hardnesse, therefore heare vs

   corio. auffidius, and you volces marke, for wee'l
heare nought from rome in priuate. your request?
  volum. should we be silent & not speak, our raiment
and state of bodies would bewray what life
we haue led since thy exile. thinke with thy selfe,
how more vnfortunate then all liuing women
are we come hither; since that thy sight, which should
make our eies flow with ioy, harts dance with comforts,
constraines them weepe, and shake with feare & sorow,
making the mother, wife, and childe to see,
the sonne, the husband, and the father tearing
his countries bowels out; and to poore we
thine enmities most capitall: thou barr'st vs
our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort
that all but we enioy. for how can we?
alas! how can we, for our country pray?
whereto we are bound, together with thy victory:
whereto we are bound: alacke, or we must loose
the countrie our deere nurse, or else thy person
our comfort in the country. we must finde
an euident calamity, though we had
our wish, which side should win. for either thou
must as a forraine recreant be led
with manacles through our streets, or else
triumphantly treade on thy countries ruine,
and beare the palme, for hauing brauely shed
thy wife and childrens blood: for my selfe, sonne,
i purpose not to waite on fortune, till
these warres determine: if i cannot perswade thee,
rather to shew a noble grace to both parts,
then seeke the end of one; thou shalt no sooner
march to assault thy country, then to treade
(trust too't, thou shalt not) on thy mothers wombe
that brought thee to this world

   virg. i, and mine, that brought you forth this boy,
to keepe your name liuing to time

   boy. a shall not tread on me: ile run away
till i am bigger, but then ile fight

   corio. not of a womans tendernesse to be,
requires nor childe, nor womans face to see:
i haue sate too long

   volum. nay, go not from vs thus:
if it were so, that our request did tend
to saue the romanes, thereby to destroy
the volces whom you serue, you might condemne vs
as poysonous of your honour. no, our suite
is that you reconcile them: while the volces
may say, this mercy we haue shew'd: the romanes,
this we receiu'd, and each in either side
giue the all-haile to thee, and cry be blest
for making vp this peace. thou know'st (great sonne)
the end of warres vncertaine: but this certaine,
that if thou conquer rome, the benefit
which thou shalt thereby reape, is such a name
whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses:
whose chronicle thus writ, the man was noble,
but with his last attempt, he wip'd it out:
destroy'd his country, and his name remaines
to th' insuing age, abhorr'd. speake to me son:
thou hast affected the fiue straines of honor,
to imitate the graces of the gods.
to teare with thunder the wide cheekes a'th' ayre,
and yet to change thy sulphure with a boult
that should but riue an oake. why do'st not speake?
think'st thou it honourable for a nobleman
still to remember wrongs? daughter, speake you:
he cares not for your weeping. speake thou boy,
perhaps thy childishnesse will moue him more
then can our reasons. there's no man in the world
more bound to's mother, yet heere he let's me prate
like one i'th' stockes. thou hast neuer in thy life,
shew'd thy deere mother any curtesie,
when she (poor hen) fond of no second brood,
ha's clock'd thee to the warres: and safelie home
loden with honor. say my request's vniust,
and spurne me backe: but, if it be not so
thou art not honest, and the gods will plague thee
that thou restrain'st from me the duty, which
to a mothers part belongs. he turnes away:
down ladies: let vs shame him with him with our knees
to his sur-name coriolanus longs more pride
then pitty to our prayers. downe: an end,
this is the last. so, we will home to rome,
and dye among our neighbours: nay, behold's,
this boy that cannot tell what he would haue,
but kneeles, and holds vp hands for fellowship,
doe's reason our petition with more strength
then thou hast to deny't. come, let vs go:
this fellow had a volcean to his mother:
his wife is in corioles, and his childe
like him by chance: yet giue vs our dispatch:
i am husht vntill our city be afire, & then ile speak a litle

holds her by the hand silent.

  corio. o mother, mother!
what haue you done? behold, the heauens do ope,
the gods looke downe, and this vnnaturall scene
they laugh at. oh my mother, mother: oh!
you haue wonne a happy victory to rome.
but for your sonne, beleeue it: oh beleeue it,
most dangerously you haue with him preuail'd,
if not most mortall to him. but let it come:
auffidius, though i cannot make true warres,
ile frame conuenient peace. now good auffidius,
were you in my steed, would you haue heard
a mother lesse? or granted lesse auffidius?
  auf. i was mou'd withall

   corio. i dare be sworne you were:
and sir, it is no little thing to make
mine eyes to sweat compassion. but (good sir)
what peace you'l make, aduise me: for my part,
ile not to rome, ile backe with you, and pray you
stand to me in this cause. oh mother! wife!
  auf. i am glad thou hast set thy mercy, & thy honor
at difference in thee: out of that ile worke
my selfe a former fortune

   corio. i by and by; but we will drinke together:
and you shall beare
a better witnesse backe then words, which we
on like conditions, will haue counter-seal'd.
come enter with vs: ladies you deserue
to haue a temple built you: all the swords
in italy, and her confederate armes
could not haue made this peace.

  sicin. why what of that?
  mene. if it be possible for you to displace it with your
little finger, there is some hope the ladies of rome, especially
his mother, may preuaile with him. but i say, there
is no hope in't, our throats are sentenc'd, and stay vppon
execution

   sicin. is't possible, that so short a time can alter the
condition of a man

then a creeping thing

   mene. so did he mee: and he no more remembers his
mother now, then an eight yeare old horse. the tartnesse
of his face, sowres ripe grapes. when he walks, he moues
like an engine, and the ground shrinkes before his treading.
he is able to pierce a corslet with his eye: talkes
like a knell, and his hum is a battery. he sits in his state,
as a thing made for alexander. what he bids bee done, is
finisht with his bidding. he wants nothing of a god but
eternity, and a heauen to throne in

   sicin. yes, mercy, if you report him truly

   mene. i paint him in the character. mark what mercy
his mother shall bring from him: there is no more
mercy in him, then there is milke in a male-tyger, that
shall our poore city finde: and all this is long of you

   sicin. the gods be good vnto vs

vnto vs. when we banish'd him, we respected not them:
