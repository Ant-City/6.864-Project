Aegisthus - 
      Aegisthus is the paramour of Clytemnestra and responsible for the murder of Agamemnon. Like Clytemnestra, he is aware of the uneasy foundations upon which his position rests. His great desire is to eliminate threats to his way of life; always cruel to Electra, he wants to lock her away along with her perpetual grieving, and he celebrates Orestes' supposed death.
