i am bound to speake,
my mistris heere lyes murthered in her bed

   all. oh heauens, forefend

   emil. and your reports haue set the murder on

   othello. nay stare not masters,
it is true indeede

   gra. 'tis a strange truth

   mont. o monstrous acte

   emil. villany, villany, villany:
i thinke vpon't, i thinke: i smel't: o villany:
i thought so then: ile kill my selfe for greefe.
o villany! villany!
  iago. what, are you mad?
i charge you get you home

   emil. good gentlemen, let me haue leaue to speake:
'tis proper i obey him; but not now:
perchance iago, i will ne're go home

   oth. oh, oh, oh

   emil. nay, lay thee

hold, i haue a weapon:
a better neuer did it selfe sustaine
vpon a soldiers thigh. i haue seene the day,
that with this little arme, and this good sword,
i haue made my way through more impediments
then twenty times your stop. but (oh vaine boast)
who can controll his fate? 'tis not so now.
be not affraid, though you do see me weapon'd:
heere is my iournies end, heere is my butt
and verie sea-marke of my vtmost saile.
do you go backe dismaid? 'tis a lost feare:
man but a rush against othello's brest,
and he retires. where should othello go?
now: how dost thou looke now? oh ill-starr'd wench,
pale as thy smocke: when we shall meete at compt,
this looke of thine will hurle my soule from heauen,
and fiends will snatch at it. cold, cold, my girle?
euen like thy chastity. o cursed, cursed slaue!
whip me ye diuels,
from the possession of this heauenly sight:
blow me about in windes, roast me in sulphure,
wash me in steepe-downe gulfes of liquid fire.
oh desdemon! dead desdemon
