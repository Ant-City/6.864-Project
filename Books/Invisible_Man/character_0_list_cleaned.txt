the [CHARACTER] - 
                the
nameless protagonist of the novel. the [CHARACTER] is the "invisible
man" of the title. a black man in 1930s america,
the [CHARACTER] considers himself invisible because people never see
his true self beneath the roles that stereotype and racial prejudice
compel him to play. though the [CHARACTER] is intelligent, deeply introspective, and
highly gifted with language, the experiences that he relates demonstrate
that he was naive in his youth. as the novel progresses, the [CHARACTER]'s
illusions are gradually destroyed through his experiences as a student
at college, as a worker at the liberty paints plant, and as a member
of a political organization known as the brotherhood. shedding his
blindness, he struggles to arrive at a conception of his identity
that honors his complexity as an individual without sacrificing
social responsibility.
