 she asked at the
threshold.

“come whenever you feel like it. be careful; the stairs and landings are
dark; don’t stumble.”

mademoiselle reentered and lit a candle. robert’s letter was on the
floor. she stooped and picked it up. it was crumpled and damp with
tears. mademoiselle smoothed the letter out, restored it to the
envelope, and replaced it in the table drawer.

one morning on his way into town mr. pontellier stopped at the house of
his old friend and family physician, doctor mandelet. the doctor was a
semi-retired physician, resting, as the saying is, upon his laurels.
he bore a reputation for wisdom rather than skill--leaving the active
practice of medicine to his assistants and younger contemporaries--and
was much sought for in matters of consultation. a few families, united
to him by bonds of friendship, he still attended when they required the
services of a physician. the pontelliers were among these.

mr. pontellier found the doctor reading at the open window of his st

anything for him which she might do herself. her husband noticed, and
thought it was the expression of a deep filial attachment which he had
never suspected.

the colonel drank numerous “toddies” during the course of the day, which
left him, however, imperturbed. he was an expert at concocting strong
drinks. he had even invented some, to which he had given fantastic
names, and for whose manufacture he required diverse ingredients that it
devolved upon edna to procure for him.

when doctor mandelet dined with the pontelliers on thursday he could
discern in mrs. pontellier no trace of that morbid condition which her
husband had reported to him. she was excited and in a manner radiant.
she and her father had been to the race course, and their thoughts when
they seated themselves at table were still occupied with the events of
the afternoon, and their talk was still of the track. the doctor had not
kept pace with turf affairs. he had certain recollections of racing
in what he called “the g

ion. he was growing old, and beginning to need rest
and an imperturbed spirit. he did not want the secrets of other lives
thrust upon him.

“i hope it isn’t arobin,” he muttered to himself as he walked. “i hope
to heaven it isn’t alcee arobin.”

edna and her father had a warm, and almost violent dispute upon the
subject of her refusal to attend her sister’s wedding. mr. pontellier
declined to interfere, to interpose either his influence or his
authority. he was following doctor mandelet’s advice, and letting her do
as she liked. the colonel reproached his daughter for her lack of
filial kindness and respect, her want of sisterly affection and womanly
consideration. his arguments were labored and unconvincing. he doubted
if janet would accept any excuse--forgetting that edna had offered
none. he doubted if janet would ever speak to her again, and he was sure
margaret would not.

edna was glad to be rid of her father when he finally took himself
off with his wedding garments a

sprinkled with cologne water.

“this is too much!” she cried. “mandelet ought to be killed! where is
alphonse? is it possible i am to be abandoned like this--neglected by
every one?”

“neglected, indeed!” exclaimed the nurse. wasn’t she there? and here was
mrs. pontellier leaving, no doubt, a pleasant evening at home to devote
to her? and wasn’t monsieur ratignolle coming that very instant through
the hall? and josephine was quite sure she had heard doctor mandelet’s
coupe. yes, there it was, down at the door.

adele consented to go back to her room. she sat on the edge of a little
low couch next to her bed.

doctor mandelet paid no attention to madame ratignolle’s upbraidings. he
was accustomed to them at such times, and was too well convinced of her
loyalty to doubt it.

he was glad to see edna, and wanted her to go with him into the salon
and entertain him. but madame ratignolle would not consent that edna
should leave her for an instant. between a

she was still stunned and speechless with emotion when later she leaned
over her friend to kiss her and softly say good-by. adele, pressing her
cheek, whispered in an exhausted voice: “think of the children, edna. oh
think of the children! remember them!”

edna still felt dazed when she got outside in the open air. the doctor’s
coupe had returned for him and stood before the porte cochere. she did
not wish to enter the coupe, and told doctor mandelet she would walk;
she was not afraid, and would go alone. he directed his carriage to meet
him at mrs. pontellier’s, and he started to walk home with her.

up--away up, over the narrow street between the tall houses, the stars
were blazing. the air was mild and caressing, but cool with the breath
of spring and the night. they walked slowly, the doctor with a heavy,
measured tread and his hands behind him; edna, in an absent-minded way,
as she had walked one night at grand isle, as if her though

but they need not have thought that they could possess her, body and
soul. how mademoiselle reisz would have laughed, perhaps sneered, if she
knew! “and you call yourself an artist! what pretensions, madame! the
artist must possess the courageous soul that dares and defies.”

exhaustion was pressing upon and overpowering her.

“good-by--because i love you.” he did not know; he did not understand.
he would never understand. perhaps doctor mandelet would have understood
if she had seen him--but it was too late; the shore was far behind her,
and her strength was gone.

she looked into the distance, and the old terror flamed up for an
instant, then sank again. edna heard her father’s voice and her sister
margaret’s. she heard the barking of an old dog that was chained to the
sycamore tree. the spurs of the cavalry officer clanged as he walked
across the porch. there was the hum of bees, and the musky odor of pinks
filled the air.
