    in troy, there lies the scene. from isles of greece
    the princes orgillous, their high blood chaf'd,
    have to the port of athens sent their ships
    fraught with the ministers and instruments
    of cruel war. sixty a

nd nine that wore
    their crownets regal from th' athenian bay
    put forth toward phrygia; and their vow is made
    to ransack troy, within whose strong immures
    the ravish'd helen, menelaus' queen,
    with wanton paris sleeps-and that's the quarrel.
    to tenedos they come,
    and the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge
    their war-like fraughtage. now on dardan plains
    the fresh and yet unbruised greeks do pitch
    their brave pavilions: priam's six-gated city,
    dardan, and tymbria, helias, chetas, troien,
    and antenorides, with massy staples
    and corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,
    sperr up the sons of troy.
    now expectation, tickling skittish spirits
    on one and other side, troyan and greek,
    sets all on hazard-and hither am i come
    a prologue arm'd, but not in confidence
    of author's pen or actor's voice, but suited
    in like conditions as our argument,
    to tell you, fair beholders, that

    why should i war without the walls of troy

  pandarus. ay, the bolting; but you must tarry the leavening.
  troilus. still have i tarried.
  pandarus. ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word
    'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the heating
    of the oven, and the baking; nay, you must stay the cooling too,
    or you may chance to burn your lips.
  troilus. patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,
    doth lesser blench at suff'rance than i do.
    at priam's royal table do i sit;
    and when fair cressid comes into my thoughts-
    so, traitor, then she comes when she is thence.
  pandarus. well, she look'd yesternight fairer than ever i saw her
    look, or any woman else.
  troilus. i was about to tell thee: when my heart,
    as wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,
    lest hector or my father should perceive me,
    i have, as when the sun doth light a storm,
    buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile.

    we have, great agamemnon, here in troy
    a prince called hector-priam is his father-
    who in this dull and long-continued truce
    is resty grown; he bade me take a trumpet
    and to this purpose speak: kings, princes, lords!

    you have the honey still, but these the gall;
    so to be valiant is no praise at all.

    and fame in time to come canonize us;
    for i presume brave hector would not lose
    so rich advantage of a promis'd glory
    as smiles upon the forehead of this action
    for the wide world's revenue.
  hector. i am yours,
    you valiant offspring of great priamus.
    i have a roisting challenge sent amongst
    the dull and factious nobles of the greeks

  margarelon. a bastard son of priam's.
