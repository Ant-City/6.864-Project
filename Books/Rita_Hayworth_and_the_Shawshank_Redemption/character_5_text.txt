 parts of it from maybe half a dozen different
sources. i've said once that prisoners are nothing but slaves, but they have
that slave habit of looking dumb and keeping their ears open. i got it backwards
and forwards and in the middle, but i'll give it to you from point a to point z.
and maybe you'll understand why the man spent about ten months in a bleak,
depressed daze. see, i don't think he knew the truth until 1963, fifteen years
after he came into this sweet little hellhole. until he met tommy williams, i
don't think he knew how bad it could get.
tommy williams joined our happy little shawshank family in november of 1962.
tommy thought of himself as a native of massachusetts, but he wasn't proud; in
his twenty-seven years he'd done time all over new england. he was a
professional thief, and as you may have guessed, my own feeling was that he
should have picked another profession.
he was a married man, and his wife came to visit each and every week. she had an
idea that things might go better

with tommy- and consequently better with their

three-year-old son and herself- if he got his high school degree. she talked him
into it, and so tommy williams started visiting the library on a regular basis.
for andy, this was an old routine by then. he saw that tommy got a series of
high school equivalency tests. tommy would brush up on the subjects he had
passed in high school-there weren't many-and then take the test. andy also saw
that he was enrolled in a number of correspondence courses covering the subjects
he had failed in school or just missed by dropping out.
he probably wasn't the best student andy ever took over the jumps, and i don't

to the basket. he was just getting to the jury
waiting until after lunch to bring in their guilty verdict when the trouble
whistle went off and the mangle grated to a stop. they had been feeding in
freshly washed sheets from the eliot nursing home at the far end; these were
spat out dry and neatly pressed at tommy's and charlie's end at the rate of one
every five seconds. their job was to grab them, fold them, and slap them into
the cart, which had already been lined with clean brown paper.
but tommy williams was just standing there, staring at charlie lathrop, his
mouth unhinged all the way to his chest. he was standing in a drift of sheets
that had come through clean and which were now sopping up all the wet muck on
the floor-and in a laundry wetwash, there's plenty of muck.
so the head bull that day, homer jessup, comes rushing over, bellowing his head
off and on the prod for trouble. tommy took no notice of him. he spoke to
charlie as if old homer, who had busted more heads than he could probabl

"what did you say that golf pro's name was?"
"quentin," charlie answered back, all confused and upset by now. he later said
that the kid was as white as a truce flag. "glenn quentin, i think. something
like that, anyway-"
"here now, here now," homer jessup roared, his neck as red as a roosters comb.
"get them sheets in cold water! get quick! get quick, by jesus, you-"
"glenn quentin, oh my god," tommy williams said, and that was all he got to say
because homer jessup, that least peaceable of men, brought his billy down behind
his ear. tommy hit the floor so hard he broke off three of his front teeth. when
he woke up he was in solitary, and confined to same for a week, riding a boxcar
on sam norton's famous grain and drain train. plus a black mark on his report
card.
that was in early february of 1963, and tommy williams went around to six or
seven other long-timers after he got out of solitary and go

putting long, moving shadows on the cement walls of the cage he had called home
since harry truman was president, and tried to think it all out. he said it was
as if tommy had produced a key which fit a cage in the back of his mind, a cage
like his own cell. only instead of holding a man, that cage held a tiger, and
that tiger's name was hope. williams had produced the key that unlocked the cage
and the tiger was out, willy-nilly, to roam his brain.
four years before, tommy williams had been arrested in rhode island, driving a
stolen car that was full of stolen merchandise. tommy turned in his accomplice,
the da played ball, and he got a lighter sentence . . . two to four, with time
served. eleven months after beginning his term, his old cellmate got a ticket
out and tommy got a new one, a man named elwood blatch. blatch had been busted 
44
for burglary with a weapon and was serving six to twelve.
"i never seen such a high-strung guy," tommy told me. "a man like that shoul

one hand, and the very real possibility that he
might be gone like the wind on the other.
there were inconsistencies in tommy's story, but aren't there always in real
life? blatch told tommy the man who got sent up was a hotshot lawyer, and andy
was a banker, but those are two professions that people who aren't very educated
could easily get mixed up. and don't forget that twelve years had gone by
between the time blatch was reading the clippings about the trial and the time
he told the tale to tommy williams. he also told tommy he got better than a
thousand dollars from a footlocker quentin had in his closet, but the police
said at andy's trial that there had been no sign of burglary. i have a few ideas
about that. first, if you take the cash and the man it belonged to is dead, how
are you going to know anything was stolen, unless someone else can tell you it
was there to start with? second, who's to say blatch wasn't lying about that
part of it? maybe he didn't want to admit killing two people for

andy's voice it was so changed. "warden. . . there's something . . . something's
happened to me that's . . . that's so . . . so . . . i hardly know where to
begin."
"well, why don't you just begin at the beginning?" the warden said, probably in
his sweetest let's-all-turn-to- the-twenty-third- psalm-and-read-in-unison
voice. "that usually works the best."
and so andy did. he began by refreshing norton on the details of the crime he
had been imprisoned for. then he told the warden exactly what tommy williams had
told him. he also gave out tommy's name, which you may think wasn't so wise in
light of later developments, but i'd just ask you what else he could have done,
if his story was to have any credibility at all.
when he had finished, norton was completely silent for some time. i can just see
him, probably tipped back in his office chair under the picture of governor reed
hanging on the wall, his fingers steepled, his liver lips pursed, his brow
wrinkled into ladder rungs halfway to the crown of

mine. i could hear crazy stories like yours twice a week if i wanted to lay myself open to
them. every sinner in this place would be using me for a crying towel. i had more respect
for you. but this is the end. the end. have we got an understanding?"
"yes," andy said. "but i'll be hiring a lawyer, you know."
"what in god's name for?"
"i think we can put it together," andy said. "with tommy williams and with my
testimony and corroborative testimony from records and employees at the country club, i
think we can put it together. "
"tommy williams is no longer an inmate of this facility."
"what?"

"he's been transferred."
"transferred where?"
"cashman. "
at that, andy fell silent. he was an intelligent man, but it would have taken an
extraordinarily stupid man not to smell deal all over that. cashman was a minimumsecurity
prison far up north in aroostook county. the inmates pick a lot of p

, not as long as
warden norton was evaluating the nominations. and andy was not the kind of man
to try a casual sid nedeau type of escape.
if i had been him, the thought of that key would have tormented me endlessly. i
would have been lucky to get two hours' worth of honest shut-eye a night. buxton
was less than thirty miles from shawshank. so near and yet so far.
i still thought his best chance was to engage a lawyer and try for the retrial.
anything to get out from under norton's thumb. maybe tommy williams could be
shut up by nothing more than a cushy furlough program, but i wasn't entirely
sure. maybe a good old mississippi hard-ass lawyer could crack him . . . and
maybe that lawyer wouldn't even have to work that hard. williams had honestly
liked andy. every now and then i'd bring these points up to andy, who would only
smile, his eyes far away, and say he was thinking about it.
apparently he'd been thinking about a lot of other things, as well.
in 1975, andy dufresne escaped from shawshank. he
