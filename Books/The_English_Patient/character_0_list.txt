Almasy  - 
      The protagonist of the novel and the English patient of the title. Almasy is knowledgeable and reflective, the "blank screen" upon which the other characters reflect their thoughts and wishes. Though he is badly burned in a plane crash, he retains all his mental faculties and is able to tell Hana, Kip, and Caravaggio the pieces of his past and the story of how he fell in love with Katharine. Almasy strongly believes that nations are dangerous inventions, and that love can transcend both time and geography.
