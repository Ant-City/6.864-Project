ied. it was miss taylor’s loss which first brought grief. it was on the wedding-day of this beloved friend that emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance. the wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening. her father composed himself to sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost.
the event had every promise of happiness for her friend. mr. weston was a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match; but it was a black morning’s work for her. the want of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day. she recalled her past kindness—the kindness, the affection of sixteen years—how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old—how she had

how was she to bear the change?—it was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them; but emma was aware that great must be the difference between a mrs. weston, only half a mile from them, and a miss taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude. she dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her. he could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.
the evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and mr. woodhouse had not married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits; for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without a

 that other people could feel differently from himself, he was very much disposed to think miss taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield. emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner,
“poor miss taylor!—i wish she were here again. what a pity it is that mr. weston ever thought of her!”
“i cannot agree with you, papa; you know i cannot. mr. weston is such a good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves a good wife;—and you would not have had miss taylor live with us for ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her own?”
“a house of her own!—but where is the advantage of a house of her own? this is three times as large.—and you have never any odd humours, my dear.”

“the carriage! but james will not like to put the horses to for such a little way;—and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit?”
“they are to be put into mr. weston’s stable, papa. you know we have settled all that already. we talked it all over with mr. weston last night. and as for james, you may be very sure he will always like going to randalls, because of his daughter’s being housemaid there. i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else. that was your doing, papa. you got hannah that good place. nobody thought of hannah till you mentioned her—james is so obliged to you!”

“and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,” said emma, “and a very considerable one—that i made the match myself. i made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the right, when so many people said mr. weston would never marry again, may comfort me for any thing.”
mr. knightley shook his head at her. her father fondly replied, “ah! my dear, i wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for whatever you say always comes to pass. pray do not make any more matches.”
“i promise you to make none for myself, papa; but i must, indeed, for other people. it is the greatest amusement in the world! and after such success, you know!—every body said that mr. weston would never marry again. oh

“i do not understand what you mean by ‘success,’” said mr. knightley. “success supposes endeavour. your time has been properly and delicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage. a worthy employment for a young lady’s mind! but if, which i rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it, means only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, ‘i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor if mr. weston were to marry her,’ and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards, why do you talk of success? where is your merit? what are you proud of? you made a lucky guess; and that is all that can be said.”
“and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?—i pity you.—i thought you cleverer—for, depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck. there is always some talent in it. and as to my poor word ‘success,’ which you quarrel with, i do not know th

“a straightforward, open-hearted man like weston, and a rational, unaffected woman like miss taylor, may be safely left to manage their own concerns. you are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than good to them, by interference.”
“emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,” rejoined mr. woodhouse, understanding but in part. “but, my dear, pray do not make any more matches; they are silly things, and break up one’s family circle grievously.”

chapter ii

mr. weston was a native of highbury, and born of a respectable family, which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property. he had received a good education, but, on succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged, and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county, then embodied.
captain weston was a general favourite; and

miss churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her fortune—though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate—was not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the infinite mortification of mr. and mrs. churchill, who threw her off with due decorum. it was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce much happiness. mrs. weston ought to have found more in it, for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him; but though she had one sort of spirit, she had not the best. she had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother, but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother’s unreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her former home. they lived beyond their income, but

still it was nothing in comparison of enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at once to be the wife of captain weston, and miss churchill of enscombe.
captain weston, who had been considered, especially by the churchills, as making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years’ marriage, he was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain. from the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved. the boy had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother’s, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and mr. and mrs. churchill, having

he had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his own; for as to frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle’s heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of churchill on coming of age. it was most unlikely, therefore, that he should ever want his father’s assistance. his father had no apprehension of it. the aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her husband entirely; but it was not in mr. weston’s nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he believed, so deservedly dear. he saw his son every year in london, and was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made highbury feel a sort of pride in him too. he was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern.

enerally proposed, as a most proper attention, that the visit should take place. there was not a dissentient voice on the subject, either when mrs. perry drank tea with mrs. and miss bates, or when mrs. and miss bates returned the visit. now was the time for mr. frank churchill to come among them; and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion. for a few days, every morning visit in highbury included some mention of the handsome letter mrs. weston had received. “i suppose you have heard of the handsome letter mr. frank churchill has written to mrs. weston? i understand it was a very handsome letter, indeed. mr. woodhouse told me of it. mr. woodhouse saw the letter, and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life.”
it was, indeed, a highly prized letter. mrs. weston had, of course, formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a most wel

her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to mrs. weston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction—her more than satisfaction—her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent, that emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ‘poor miss taylor,’ when they

there was a strange rumour in highbury of all the little perrys being seen with a slice of mrs. weston’s wedding-cake in their hands: but mr. woodhouse would never believe it.




chapter iii

mr. woodhouse was fond of society in his own way. he liked very much to have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes, from his long residence at hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune, his house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of his own little circle, in a great measure, as he liked. he had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle; his horro

ly for him, highbury, including randalls in the same parish, and donwell abbey in the parish adjoining, the seat of mr. knightley, comprehended many such. not unfrequently, through emma’s persuasion, he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him: but evening parties were what he preferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company, there was scarcely an evening in the week in which emma could not make up a card-table for him.
real, long-standing regard brought the westons and mr. knightley; and by mr. elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of mr. woodhouse’s drawing-room, and the smiles of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.
after these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were mrs. and miss bates, and mrs. goddard, three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from hartfield, and who were f

 herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to mr. woodhouse’s kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside.
these were the ladies whom emma found herself very frequently able to collect; and happy was she, for her father’s sake, in the power; though, as far as she was herself concerned, it was no remedy for the absence of mrs. weston. she was delighted to see her father look comfortable, and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated.
as she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day, a note was brought from mrs. goddard, requesting, in most respectful terms, to be allowed to bring miss smith with her; a most welcome request

chapter iv

harriet smith’s intimacy at hartfield was soon a settled thing. quick and decided in her ways, emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging, and telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased, so did their satisfaction in each other. as a walking companion, emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her. in that respect mrs. weston’s loss had been important. her father never went beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk, or his short, as the year varied; and since mrs. weston’s marriage her exercise had been too much confined. she had ventured once alone to randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a harriet smith, therefore, one whom she could summon at any time to a walk, would be a valuable addition to her privileges. but in every respect, as she saw more of her, she appro

“mr. knightley’s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare mr. martin with him. you might not see one in a hundred with gentleman so plainly written as in mr. knightley. but he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to. what say you to mr. weston and mr. elton? compare mr. martin with either of them. compare their manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being silent. you must see the difference.”
“oh yes!—there is a great difference. but mr. weston is almost an old man. mr. weston must be between forty and fifty.”

“there is no saying, indeed,” replied harriet rather solemnly.
“but there may be pretty good guessing. he will be a completely gross, vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking of nothing but profit and loss.”
“will he, indeed? that will be very bad.”

“i wonder he did not remember the book”—was all harriet’s answer, and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which emma thought might be safely left to itself. she, therefore, said no more for some time. her next beginning was,
“in one respect, perhaps, mr. elton’s manners are superior to mr. knightley’s or mr. weston’s. they have more gentleness. they might be more safely held up as a pattern. there is an openness, a quickness, almost a bluntness in mr. weston, which every body likes in him, because there is so much good-humour with it—but that would not do to be copied. neither would mr. knightley’s downright, decided, commanding sort of manner, though it suits him very well; his figure, and look, and situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to set about copying him, he would not

chapter v

“i do not know what your opinion may be, mrs. weston,” said mr. knightley, “of this great intimacy between emma and harriet smith, but i think it a bad thing.”
“a bad thing! do you really think it a bad thing?—why so?”
“i think they will neither of them do the other any good.”
“you surprize me! emma must do harriet good: and by supplying her with a new object of interest, harriet may be said to do emma good. i have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. how very differently we feel!—not think they will do each

“perhaps you think i am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowing weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.”
“mr. weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here, for he thinks exactly as i do on the subject. we were speaking of it only yesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for emma, that there should be such a girl in highbury for her to associate with. mr. knightley, i shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case. you are so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value of a companion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her

“i dare say,” replied mrs. weston, smiling, “that i thought so then;—but since we have parted, i can never remember emma’s omitting to do any thing i wished.”
“there is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as that,”—said mr. knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done. “but i,” he soon added, “who have had no such charm thrown over my senses, must still see, hear, and remember. emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family. at ten years old, she had the misfortune of being able t

“yes,” said he, smiling. “you are better placed here; very fit for a wife, but not at all for a governess. but you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at hartfield. you might not give emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise; but you were receiving a very good education from her, on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and doing as you were bid; and if weston had asked me to recommend him a wife, i should certainly have named miss taylor.”
“thank you. there will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as mr. weston.”
“why, to own the truth, i am afraid you are rather thrown away, and that with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne. we will not despair, however. weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort, or his son may plague him.”
“i hope not that.—it is not likely. no, mr. knightley,

“and i, mr. knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm. with all dear emma’s little faults, she is an excellent creature. where shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder sister, or a truer friend? no, no; she has qualities which may be trusted; she will never lead any one really wrong; she will make no lasting blunder; where emma errs once, she is in the

“so do i,” said mrs. weston gently, “very much.”
“she always declares she will never marry, which, of course, means just nothing at all. but i have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for. it would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object. i should like to see emma in love, and in some doubt of a return; it would do her good. but there is nobody hereabouts to attach her; and she goes so seldom from home.”
“there does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break her

part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and mr. weston’s on the subject, as much as possible. there were wishes at randalls respecting emma’s destiny, but it was not desirable to have them suspected; and the quiet transition which mr. knightley soon afterwards made to “what does weston think of the weather; shall we have rain?” convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about hartfield.

yes, good man!—thought emma—but what has all that to do with taking likenesses? you know nothing of drawing. don’t pretend to be in raptures about mine. keep your raptures for harriet’s face. “well, if you give me such kind encouragement, mr. elton, i believe i shall try what i can do. harriet’s features are very delicate, which makes a likeness difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and th

the same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction, took place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress of the picture, which was rapid and happy. every body who saw it was pleased, but mr. elton was in continual raptures, and defended it through every criticism.
“miss woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted,”—observed mrs. weston to him—not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover.—“the expression of the eye is most correct, but miss smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes. it is the fault of her face that she has them not.”
“do you think so?” replied he. “i cannot agree with you. it appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature. i never saw such a likeness in my life. we must allow for the effect of shade, you know.”

ow you must miss her! and dear emma, too!—what a dreadful loss to you both!—i have been so grieved for you.—i could not imagine how you could possibly do without her.—it is a sad change indeed.—but i hope she is pretty well, sir.”
“pretty well, my dear—i hope—pretty well.—i do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably.”
mr. john knightley here asked emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of randalls.
“oh! no—none in the least. i never saw mrs. weston better in my life—never looking so well. papa is only speaking his own regret.”
“very much to the honour of both,” was the handsome reply.
“and do you see her, sir, tolerably often?” asked isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father.
mr. woodhouse hesitated.—“not near so often, my dear, as i could wish.”
“oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married. either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting one, have we seen eithe

“just as it should be,” said mr. john knightley, “and just as i hoped it was from your letters. her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy. i have been always telling you, my love, that i had no idea of the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended; and now you have emma’s account

, i hope you will be satisfied.”
“why, to be sure,” said mr. woodhouse—“yes, certainly—i cannot deny that mrs. weston, poor mrs. weston, does come and see us pretty often—but then—she is always obliged to go away again.”
“it would be very hard upon mr. weston if she did not, papa.—you quite forget poor mr. weston.”
“i think, indeed,” said john knightley pleasantly, “that mr. weston has some little claim. you and i, emma, will venture to take the part of the poor husband. i, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force. as for isabella, she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the mr. westons aside as much as she can.”

“where is the young man?” said john knightley. “has he been here on this occasion—or has he not?”
“he has not been here yet,” replied emma. “there was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in nothing; and i have not heard him mentioned lately.”
“but you should tell them of the letter, my dear,” said her father. “he wrote a letter to poor mrs. weston, to congratulate her, and a very proper, handsome letter it was. she shewed it to me. i thought it very well done of him indeed. whether it was his own idea you know, one cannot tell. he is but young, and his uncle, perhaps—”
“my dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. you forget how time passes.”

r, it was an exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave mr. and mrs. weston a great deal of pleasure. i remember it was written from weymouth, and dated sept. 28th—and began, ‘my dear madam,’ but i forget how it went on; and it was signed ‘f. c. weston churchill.’—i remember that perfectly.”
“how very pleasing and proper of him!” cried the good-hearted mrs. john knightley. “i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man. but how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father! there is something so shocking in a child’s being taken away from his parents and natural home! i never could comprehend how mr. weston could part with him. to give up one’s child! i really never could think well of any body who proposed

 such a thing to any body else.”
“nobody ever did think well of the churchills, i fancy,” observed mr. john knightley coolly. “but you need not imagine mr. weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up henry or john. mr. weston is rather an easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings; he takes things as he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other, depending, i suspect, much more upon what is called society for his comforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week, than upon family affection, or any thing that home affords.”
emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on mr. weston, and had half a mind to take it up;

sit to hartfield, going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister. she had nothing to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass so swiftly. it was a delightful visit;—perfect, in being much too short.
in general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out of the house too, there was no avoiding, though at christmas. mr. weston would take no denial; they must all dine at randalls one day;—even mr. woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party.
how they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty if he could, but as his son and daughter’s carriage and horses were actually at hartfield, he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupy emma long to convince him that they might in one of the c

“it is so cold, so very cold—and looks and feels so very much like snow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, i should really try not to go out to-day—and dissuade my father from venturing; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem to feel the cold himself, i do not like to interfere, as i know it would be so great a disappointment to mr. and mrs. weston. but, upon my word, mr. elton, in your case, i should certainly excuse myself. you appear to me a little hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to-morrow will bring, i think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night.”
mr. elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make; which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist

on to give up the visit;—but emma, too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially, or see him with clear vision, was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being “very cold, certainly very cold,” and walked on, rejoicing in having extricated him from randalls, and secured him the power of sending to inquire after harriet every hour of the evening.
“you do quite right,” said she;—“we will make your apologies to mr. and mrs. weston.”
but hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were mr. elton’s only objection, and mr. elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction. it was a done thing; mr. elton was to go, and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment; never had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her.
“well,” said she to herself, “this is most

 that very day se’nnight.”
mr. john knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, but said only, coolly,
“i cannot wish to be snowed up a week at randalls.”
at another time emma might have been amused, but she was too much astonished now at mr. elton’s spirits for other feelings. harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.
“we are sure of excellent fires,” continued he, “and every thing in the greatest comfort. charming people, mr. and mrs. weston;—mrs. weston indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what one values, so hospitable, and so fond of society;—it will be a small party, but where small parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of any. mr. weston’s dining-room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably; and for my part, i would rather, under such circumstances, fall short by two than exceed by two. i think you will agree with me, (turning with a soft air to emma,) i think i shall certainly have yo

“indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) i had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery. well, sir, the time must come when you will be paid for all this, when you will have little labour and great enjoyment.”
“my first enjoyment,” replied john knightley, as they passed through the sweep-gate, “will be to find myself safe at hartfield again.”




chapter xiv

some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into mrs. weston’s drawing-room;—mr. elton must compose his joyous looks, and mr. john knightley disperse his ill-humour. mr. elton must smile less, and mr. john knightley more, to fit them for the place.—emma only might be as nature prompted, and shew herself just as happy as she was. to her it was real enjoyment to be with the westons. mr. weston was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve, as to his wife; not any one, to whom she related with s

uch conviction of being listened to and understood, of being always interesting and always intelligible, the little affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father and herself. she could tell nothing of hartfield, in which mrs. weston had not a lively concern; and half an hour’s uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.
this was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day’s visit might not afford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but the very sight of mrs. weston, her smile, her touch, her voice was grateful to emma, and she determined to think as little as possible of mr. elton’s oddities

, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost.
the misfortune of harriet’s cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival. mr. woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it, besides all the history of his own and isabella’s coming, and of emma’s being to follow, and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that james should come and see his daughter, when the others appeared, and mrs. weston, who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him, was able to turn away and welcome her dear emma.
emma’s project of forgetting mr. elton for a while made her rather sorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was close to her. the difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice, and solicitously addressing her upon ever

y occasion. instead of forgetting him, his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of “can it really be as my brother imagined? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from harriet to me?—absurd and insufferable!”—yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her father, and so delighted with mrs. weston; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners. for her own sake she could not be rude; and for harriet’s, in the hope that all would yet turn out right, she was even positively civil; but it was an effort; especially as something was going on amongst the others, in the most overpowering period of mr. elton’s nonsense, which she particularly wishe

d to listen to. she heard enough to know that mr. weston was giving some information about his son; she heard the words “my son,” and “frank,” and “my son,” repeated several times over; and, from a few other half-syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son; but before she could quiet mr. elton, the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward.
now, it so happened that in spite of emma’s resolution of never marrying, there was something in the name, in the
 
 ___________________________
 
 idea of mr. frank churchill, which always interested her. she had frequently thought—especially since his father’s marriage with miss taylor—that if she were to marry, he was the very person to suit her in age, character and condition. he seemed by this connexion between the families, quite to belong to her. she could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of. that mr. and mrs. weston did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded; and though not meaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for, she had a great curiosity to see him, a decided intention of finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to a certain degree, and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends’ imaginations.
with such sensations, mr. elton’s civilities were dreadfully ill

-timed; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very cross—and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again, or the substance of it, from the open-hearted mr. weston.—so it proved;—for when happily released from mr. elton, and seated by mr. weston, at dinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton, to say to her,
“we want only two more to be just the right number. i should like to see two more here,—your pretty little friend, miss smith, and my son—and then i should say we were quite complete. i believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing-room that we are expecting frank. i had a letter from him this morning, and he will be with us withi

n a fortnight.”
emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented to his proposition of mr. frank churchill and miss smith making their party quite complete.
“he has been wanting to come to us,” continued mr. weston, “ever since september: every letter has been full of it; but he cannot command his own time. he has those to please who must be pleased, and who (between ourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices. but now i have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in january.”
“what a very great pleasure it will be to you! and mrs. weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost as happy as yourself.”
“yes, she would be, but that she t
 
 ___________________________
 
ot the smallest doubt of the issue. i am as confident of seeing frank here before the middle of january, as i am of being here myself: but your good friend there (nodding towards the upper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself, and has been so little used to them at hartfield, that she cannot calculate on their effects, as i have been long in the practice of doing.”
“i am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,” replied emma; “but am disposed to side with you, mr. weston. if you think he will come, i shall think so too; for you know enscombe.”
“yes—i have some right to that knowledge; though i have never been at the place in my life.—she is an odd woman!—but i never allow myself to speak ill of her, on frank’s account; for i do believe her to be very fond of him. i used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body, except herself: but she has always been kind to him (in her way—allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting every 
 
 ___________________________
 
thing to be as she likes). and it is no small credit, in my opinion, to him, that he should excite such an affection; for, though i would not say it to any body else, she has no more heart than a stone to people in general; and the devil of a temper.”
emma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to mrs. weston, very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy—yet observing, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.— mrs. weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of: “for i cannot depend upon his coming. i cannot be so sanguine as mr. weston. i am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing. mr. weston, i dare say, has been telling you exactly how the matter stands?”
“yes—it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of mrs. churchill, which i imagine to be the most certain thing in the world.”
“my emma

“oh, mrs. churchill; every body knows mrs. churchill,” replied isabella: “and i am sure i never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion. to be constantly living with an ill-tempered person, must be dreadful. it is what we happily have never known any thing of; but it must be a life of misery. what a blessing, that she never had any children! poor little creatures, how unhappy she would have made them!”
emma wished she had been alone with mrs. weston. she should then have heard more: mrs. weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with isabella; and, she really believed, would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the churchills from her, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge. but at present there was nothing more to be said. mr. woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing-room. to be sitting long after dinner

ner it could be over, the better.”
“yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays. even if this family, the braithwaites, are put off, i am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us. i cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side; but i am sure there is a great wish on the churchills’ to keep him to themselves. there is jealousy. they are jealous even of his regard for his father. in short, i can feel no dependence on his coming, and i wish mr. weston were less sanguine.”
“he ought to come,” said emma. “if he could stay only a couple of days, he ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man’s not having it in his power to do as much as that. a young woman, if she fall into bad hands, may be teased, and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young man’s being under such restraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his father, if he likes it.”
“one ought to be at enscombe,

and know the ways of the family, before one decides upon what he can do,” replied mrs. weston. “one ought to use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family; but enscombe, i believe, certainly must not be judged by general rules: she is so very unreasonable; and every thing gives way to her.”
“but she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great a favourite. now, according to my idea of mrs. churchill, it would be most natural, that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to whom she owes every thing, while she

he nephew, to whom she owes nothing at all.”
“my dearest emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, to understand a bad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let it go its own way. i have no doubt of his having, at times, considerable influence; but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand when it will be.”
emma listened, and then coolly said, “i shall not be satisfied, unless he comes.”
“he may have a great deal of influence on some points,” continued mrs. weston, “and on others, very little: and among those, on which she is beyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us.”




chapter xv

mr. woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his three companions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour, before the other gentlemen appeared. mr. weston was chatty and convivial, and no friend t

o early separations of any sort; but at last the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation. mr. elton, in very good spirits, was one of the first to walk in. mrs. weston and emma were sitting together on a sofa. he joined them immediately, and, with scarcely an invitation, seated himself between them.
emma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of mr. frank churchill, was willing to forget his late improprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before, and on his making harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen with most friendly smiles.
he professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend—her fair

im not to venture into such hazard till he had seen mr. perry and learnt his opinion; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course, there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her. she was vexed. it did appear—there was no concealing it—exactly like the pretence of being in love with her, instead of harriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable! and she had difficulty in behaving with temper. he turned to mrs. weston to implore her assistance, “would not she give him her support?—would not she add her persuasions to his, to induce miss woodhouse not to go to mrs. goddard’s till it were certain that miss smith’s disorder had no infection? he could not be satisfied without a promise—would not she give him her influence in procuring it?”
“so scrupulous for others,” he continued, “and yet so careless for herself! she wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, and yet will not promis

emma saw mrs. weston’s surprize, and felt that it must be great, at an address which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her; and as for herself, she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose. she could only give him a look; but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses, and then left the sofa, removing to a seat by her sister, and giving her all her attention.

being covered with snow, and of its still snowing fast, with a strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to mr. woodhouse:
“this will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements, sir. something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow.”
poor mr. woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else had something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized, and had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer. mrs. weston and emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly.
“i admired your resolution very much, sir,” said he, “in venturing out in such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow very soon. every body must have seen the snow coming on. i admired your spirit; and i dare say we shall get home very well. another hour or two’s snow can hardly make the road impassable; and we are two carriages; if one is blown

mr. weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest it should make mr. woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for his hurrying away. as to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; he was afraid they would find no difficulty. he wished the road might be impassable, that he might be able to keep them all at randalls; and with the utmost good-will was sure tha

ng very bad, i can get out and walk. i am not at all afraid. i should not mind walking half the way. i could change my shoes, you know, the moment i got home; and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold.”
“indeed!” replied he. “then, my dear isabella, it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing does give you cold. walk home!—you are prettily shod for walking home, i dare say. it will be bad enough for the horses.”
isabella turned to mrs. weston for her approbation of the plan. mrs. weston could only approve. isabella then went to emma; but emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away; and they were still discussing the point, when mr. knightley, who had left the room immediately after his brother’s first report of the snow, came back again, and told them that he had been out of doors to examine, and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home, whenever they liked

why do not you go?”
“i am ready, if the others are.”
“shall i ring the bell?”
“yes, do.”
and the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for. a few minutes more, and emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house, to get sober and cool, and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over.
the carriage came: and mr. woodhouse, always the first object on such occasions, was carefully attended to his own by mr. knightley and mr. weston; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen, and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for. “he was afraid they should have a very bad drive. he was afraid poor isabella would not like it. and there would be poor emma in the carriage behind. he did not know what they had best do. they must keep as much together as they could;” and james was talked to, and given a charge to go very slow and

to restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had they passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she found her subject cut up—her hand seized—her attention demanded, and mr. elton actually making violent love to her: availing himself of the precious oppo

 at mrs. goddard’s; mr. elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school; and it must be at hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth. where the wound had been given, there must the cure be found if anywhere; and emma felt that, till she saw her in the way of cure, there could be no true peace for herself.




chapter xviii

mr. frank churchill did not come. when the time proposed drew near, mrs. weston’s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse. for the present, he could not be spared, to his “very great mortification and regret; but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to randalls at no distant period.”
mrs. weston was exceedingly disappointed—much more disappointed, in fact, than her husband, though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober: but a sanguine temper, though for ever expecting more good than occurs, does not always pa

y for its hopes by any proportionate depression. it soon flies over the present failure, and begins to hope again. for half an hour mr. weston was surprized and sorry; but then he began to perceive that frank’s coming two or three months later would be a much better plan; better time of year; better weather; and that he would be able, without any doubt, to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner.
these feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while mrs. weston, of a more apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer, suffered a great deal more herself.
emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about mr. frank churchill’s not coming, except as a disappointment at randalls. the acquaintance at present had no charm for her. she wanted, rather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it was desirable that she should appear, in

 general, like her usual self, she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance, and enter as warmly into mr. and mrs. weston’s disappointment, as might naturally belong to their friendship.
she was the first to announce it to mr. knightley; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps rather more,) at the conduct of the churchills, in keeping him away. she then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in surry; the pleasure of looking at somebody new; the gala-day to highbury entire, which the sight of him woul

“the churchills are very likely in fault,” said mr. knightley, coolly; “but i dare say he might come if he would.”
“i do not know why you should say so. he wishes exceedingly to come; but his uncle and aunt will not spare him.”
“i cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made a point of it. it is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof.”
“how odd you are! what has mr. frank churchill done, to make you suppose him such an

“we shall never agree about him,” cried emma; “but that is nothing extraordinary. i have not the least idea of his being a weak young man: i feel sure that he is not. mr. weston would not be blind to folly, though in his own son; but he is very likely to have a more yielding, complying, mild disposition than would suit your notions of man’s perfection. i dare say he has; and though it may cut him off from some advantages, it will secure him many others.”

“your feelings are singular. they seem to satisfy every body else.”
“i suspect they do not satisfy mrs. weston. they hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings: standing in a mother’s place, but without a mother’s affection to blind her. it is on her account that attention to randalls is doubly due, and she must doubly feel the omission. had she been a person of consequence herself, he would have come i dare say; and it would not have signified whether he did or no. can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations? do you suppose she does not often say all th

“i will say no more about him,” cried emma, “you turn every thing to evil. we are both prejudiced; you against, i for him; and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here.”
“prejudiced! i am not prejudiced.”
“but i am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it. my love for mr. and mrs. weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour.”
“he is a person i never think of from one month’s end to another,” said mr. knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made emma immediately talk of something else, though she could not comprehend why he should be angry.
to take a dislike to a young man, only because he appeared to be of a different disposition from himself, was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him; for with all the high opinio

as at home;” they had both been out some time; the man believed they were gone to hartfield.
“this is too bad,” cried emma, as they turned away. “and now we shall just miss them; too provoking!—i do not know when i have been so disappointed.” and she leaned back in the corner, to indulge her murmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both—such being the commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind. presently the carriage stopt; she looked up; it was stopt by mr. and mrs. weston, who were standing to speak to her. there was instant pleasure in the sight of them, and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound—for mr. weston immediately accosted her with,
“how d’ye do?—how d’ye do?—we have been sitting with your father—glad to see him so well. frank comes to-morrow—i had a letter this morning—we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty—he is at oxford to-day, and he comes for a whole fortnight; i knew it would be so. if he had come at christm

as he could not have staid three days; i was always glad he did not come at christmas; now we are going to have just the right weather for him, fine, dry, settled weather. we shall enjoy him completely; every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish.”
there was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as mr. weston’s, confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter, but not less to the purpose. to know that she thought his coming certain was enough to make emma consider it so, and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy. it was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits. the worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming; and in the rapidity of half a moment’s thought, she hoped mr. elton would now be talked of no more.
mr. weston gave her the

 history of the engagements at enscombe, which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command, as well as the route and the method of his journey; and she listened, and smiled, and congratulated.
“i shall soon bring him over to hartfield,” said he, at the conclusion.
emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech, from his wife.
“we had better move on, mr. weston,” said she, “we are detaining the girls.”
“well, well, i am ready;”—and turning again to emma, “but you must not be expecting such a very fine young man; you have only had my account you know; i dare say he is really nothing extraordinary:”—though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction.
emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing.
“think of me to-morrow, my dear emma, about four

o’clock,” was mrs. weston’s parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety, and meant only for her.
“four o’clock!—depend upon it he will be here by three,” was mr. weston’s quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting. emma’s spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore a different air; james and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as before. when she looked at the hedges, she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out; and when she turned round to harriet, she saw something like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.
“will mr. frank churchill pass through bath as well as oxford?”—was a question, however, w

but neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once, and emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time.
the morning of the interesting day arrived, and mrs. weston’s faithful pupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve o’clock, that she was to think of her at four.
“my dear, dear anxious friend,”—said she, in mental soliloquy, while walking downstairs from her own room, “always overcareful for every body’s comfort but your own; i see you now in all your little fidgets, going again and again into his room, to be sure that all is right.” the clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall. “‘tis twelve; i shall not forget

 to think of you four hours hence; and by this time to-morrow, perhaps, or a little later, i may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here. i am sure they will bring him soon.”
she opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with her father—mr. weston and his son. they had been arrived only a few minutes, and mr. weston had scarcely finished his explanation of frank’s being a day before his time, and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations, when she appeared, to have her share of surprize, introduction, and pleasure.
the frank churchill so long talked of, so high in interest, was actually before her—he was presented to her, and she did not think too much had been said in his praise; he was a very good looking young man; height, air, address, all were unexceptionable, a

is father’s; he looked quick and sensible. she felt immediately that she should like him; and there was a well-bred ease of manner, and a readiness to talk, which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her, and that acquainted they soon must be.
he had reached randalls the evening before. she was pleased with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan, and travel earlier, later, and quicker, that he might gain half a day.
“i told you yesterday,” cried mr. weston with exultation, “i told you all that he would be here before the time named. i remembered what i used to do myself. one cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming in upon one’s friends before the look-out begins, is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs.”
“it is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it,” said the young man, “though there are not many houses that i should presume on so far;

nd an opportunity, while their two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing his mother-in-law, and speaking of her with so much handsome praise, so much warm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his father, and her very kind reception of himself, as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please—and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her. he did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by mrs. weston; but, undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter. he understood what would be welcome; he could be sure of little else. “his father’s marriage,” he said, “had been the wisest measure, every friend must rejoice in it; and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him.”
he got as near as he could to thanking her for miss taylor’s merits, without seeming quite to forget that in the common course o

ed miss woodhouse’s character, than miss woodhouse miss taylor’s. and at last, as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object, he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person.
“elegant, agreeable manners, i was prepared for,” said he; “but i confess that, considering every thing, i had not expected more than a very tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age; i did not know that i was to find a pretty young woman in mrs. weston.”
“you cannot see too much perfection in mrs. weston for my feelings,” said emma; “were you to guess her to be eighteen, i should listen with pleasure; but she would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words. don’t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman.”
“i hope i should know better,” he replied; “no, depend upon it, (with a gallant bow,) that in addressing mrs. weston i should understand whom i might praise without any danger of being tho

ught extravagant in my terms.”
emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other, which had taken strong possession of her mind, had ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance. she must see more of him to understand his ways; at present she only felt they were agreeable.
she had no doubt of what mr. weston was often thinking about. his quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression; and even, when he might have determined not to look, she was confident that he was often listening.
her own father’s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind, the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion, was a most comfortable circumstance. happily he was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it.—though always objecting t

a reasonable visit paid, mr. weston began to move.—“he must be going. he had business at the crown about his hay, and a great many errands for mrs. weston at ford’s, but he need not hurry any body else.” his son, too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also, saying,
“as you are going farther on business, sir, i will take the opportunity of paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other, and therefore may as well be paid now. i have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours, (turning to emma

they were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one, and a graceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave. emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance, and could now engage to think of them all at randalls any hour of the day, with full confidence in their comfort.




chapter vi

the next morning brought mr. frank churchill again. he came with mrs. weston, to whom and to highbury he seemed to take very cordially. he had been sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home, till her usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse their walk, immediately fixed on highbury.—“he did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him, he should always chuse the same. highbury, that airy, cheerful, happy-looking highbury, would be his constant attraction.”—highbury, with mrs. weston, stood for hart

field; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with him. they walked thither directly.
emma had hardly expected them: for mr. weston, who had called in for half a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome, knew nothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize to her, therefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together, arm in arm. she was wanting to see him again, and especially to see him in company with mrs. weston, upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend. if he were deficient there, nothing should make amends for it. but on seeing them together, she became perfectly satisfied. it was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her—nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection. and there was time enough for emma to form a reasonable

suaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw around him, could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when particulars were given and families described, he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing, or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body’s returning into their proper place the next morning. he argued like a young man very much bent on dancing; and emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the churchills. he seemed to have all the life and spirit, cheerful feelings, and social inclinations of his father, and nothing of the pride or reserve of enscombe. of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his indifference to a confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of mind. he could be no judge, however, of the evil he was holding cheap. it was but an effusion of lively spirits.

uld certainly be at home before him—but there was no getting away, no pause; and, to my utter astonishment, i found, when he (finding me nowhere else) joined me there at last, that i had been actually sitting with them very nearly three-quarters of an hour. the good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before.”
“and how did you think miss fairfax looking?”
“ill, very ill—that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill. but the expression is hardly admissible, mrs. weston, is it? ladies can never look ill. and, seriously, miss fairfax is naturally so pale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.—a most deplorable want of complexion.”
emma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of miss fairfax’s complexion. “it was certainly never brilliant, but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face.” he listened with al

me. he comes to highbury himself, he says, six days out of the seven, and has always business at ford’s. if it be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that i may prove myself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of highbury. i must buy something at ford’s. it will be taking out my freedom.—i dare say they sell gloves.”
“oh! yes, gloves and every thing. i do admire your patriotism. you will be adored in highbury. you were very popular before you came, because you were mr. weston’s son—but lay out half a guinea at ford’s, and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues.”
they went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of “men’s beavers” and “york tan” were bringing down and displaying on the counter, he said—“but i beg your pardon, miss woodhouse, you were speaking to me, you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my amor patriae. do not let me lose it. i assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me am

?—then i will speak the truth, and nothing suits me so well. i met her frequently at weymouth. i had known the campbells a little in town; and at weymouth we were very much in the same set. colonel campbell is a very agreeable man, and mrs. campbell a friendly, warm-hearted woman. i like them all.”
“you know miss fairfax’s situation in life, i conclude; what she is destined to be?”
“yes—(rather hesitatingly)—i believe i do.”
“you get upon delicate subjects, emma,” said mrs. weston smiling; “remember that i am here.—mr. frank churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of miss fairfax’s situation in life. i will move a little farther off.”
“i certainly do forget to think of her,” said emma, “as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend.”
he looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment.
when the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop again, “did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?

r. she was particularly struck by his manner of considering mr. elton’s house, which, as well as the church, he would go and look at, and would not join them in finding much fault with. no, he could not believe it a bad house; not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having. if it were to be shared with the woman he loved, he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house. there must be ample room in it for every real comfort. the man must be a blockhead who wanted more.
mrs. weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was talking about. used only to a large house himself, and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size, he could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one. but emma, in her own mind, determined that he did know what he was talking about, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life, and to marry, from worthy motives. he might not be aware of the inroads on domest

e was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve. it did not accord with the rationality of plan, the moderation in expense, or even the unselfish warmth of heart, which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday. vanity, extravagance, love of change, restlessness of temper, which must be doing something, good or bad; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and mrs. weston, indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general; he became liable to all these charges. his father only called him a coxcomb, and thought it a very good story; but that mrs. weston did not like it, was clear enough, by her passing it over as quickly as possible, and making no other comment than that “all young people would have their little whims.”
with the exception of this little blot, emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him. mrs. weston w

always to speak of her with respect. this was all very promising; and, but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut, there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him; the honour, if not of being really in love with her, of being at least very near it, and saved only by her own indifference—(for still her resolution held of never marrying)—the honour, in short, of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance.
mr. weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which must have some weight. he gave her to understand that frank admired her extremely—thought her very beautiful and very charming; and with so much to be said for him altogether, she found she must not judge him harshly. as mrs. weston observed, “all young people would have their little whims.”
there was one person among his new acquaintance in surry, not so leniently disposed. in general he was judged, throughout the parishes of donwell and

. the circumstance was told him at hartfield; for the moment, he was silent; but emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself, over a newspaper he held in his hand, “hum! just the trifling, silly fellow i took him for.” she had half a mind to resent; but an instant’s observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore she let it pass.
although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, mr. and mrs. weston’s visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune. something occurred while they were at hartfield, to make emma want their advice; and, which was still more lucky, she wanted exactly the advice they gave.
this was the occurrence:—the coles had been settled some years in highbury, and were very good sort of people—friendly, liberal, and unpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin, in trade, and only moderately genteel. on their first coming into the coun

te—neither donwell, nor hartfield, nor randalls. nothing should tempt her to go, if they did; and she regretted that her father’s known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish. the coles were very respectable in their way, but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them. this lesson, she very much feared, they would receive only from herself; she had little hope of mr. knightley, none of mr. weston.
but she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it appeared, that when the insult came at last, it found her very differently affected. donwell and randalls had received their invitation, and none had come for her father and herself; and mrs. weston’s accounting for it with “i suppose they will not take the liberty with you; they know you do not dine out,” was not quite sufficient. she felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal; and afterwar

 was to be there in the evening, and the bateses. they had been speaking of it as they walked about highbury the day before, and frank churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence. might not the evening end in a dance? had been a question of his. the bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits; and her being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the omission to be intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.
it was the arrival of this very invitation while the westons were at hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her first remark, on reading it, was that “of course it must be declined,” she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do, that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful.
she owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely without inclination for the party. the coles expressed themselves so properly—there was so much real attention in the manner of it—so much considera

“well, sir,” cried mr. weston, “as i took miss taylor away, it is incumbent on me to supply her place, if i can; and i will step to mrs. goddard in a moment, if you wish it.”
but the idea of any thing to be done in a moment, was increasing, not lessening, mr. woodhouse’s agitation. the ladies knew better how to allay it. mr. weston must be quiet, and every thing delib

“oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired. there will be a great many people talking at once. you will not like the noise.”
“but, my dear sir,” cried mr. weston, “if emma comes away early, it will be breaking up the party.”
“and no great harm if it does,” said mr. woodhouse. “the sooner every party breaks up, the better.”
“but you do not consider how it may appear to the coles. emma’s going away directly after tea might be giving offence. they are good-natured people, and think little of their own claims; but still they must feel that any body’s hurrying away is no great compliment; and miss woodhouse’s doing it would be more though

“oh yes, papa. i have no fears at all for myself; and i should have no scruples of staying as late as mrs. weston, but on your account. i am only afraid of your sitting up for me. i am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with mrs. goddard. she loves piquet, you know; but when she is gone home, i am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself, instead of going to bed at your usual time—and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort. you must promise me not to sit up.”
he did, on the condition of some promises on her side: such as that, if she came home cold, she would be sure to w

chapter viii

frank churchill came back again; and if he kept his father’s dinner waiting, it was not known at hartfield; for mrs. weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with mr. woodhouse, to betray any imperfection which could be concealed.
he came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with a very good grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had done. he had no reason to wish his hair longer, to conceal any confusion of face; no reason to wish the money unspent, to improve his spirits. he was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever; and, after seeing him, emma thus moralised to hersel

cumstances. now you have nothing to try for. you are not afraid of being supposed ashamed. you are not striving to look taller than any body else. now i shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you.”
“nonsensical girl!” was his reply, but not at all in anger.
emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with mr. knightley. she was received with a cordial respect which could not but please, and given all the consequence she could wish for. when the westons arrived, the kindest looks of love, the strongest of admiration were for her, from both husband and wife; the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object, and at dinner she found him seated by her—and, as she firmly believed, not without some dexterity on his side.
the party was rather large, as it included one other family, a proper unobjectionable country family, whom the coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance, and the male part 
 
 ___________________________
 
n so large a party it was not necessary that emma should approach her. she did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much in the secret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair, and therefore purposely kept at a distance; but by the others, the subject was almost immediately introduced, and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received, the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of “my excellent friend colonel campbell.”
mrs. weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested by the circumstance, and emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask and to say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible, which she plainly read in the fair heroine’s countenance.
they were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first of the early was frank churchill. in he walked, the first and the ha

the unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father.
“i have made a most wretched discovery,” said he, after a short pause.— “i have been here a week to-morrow—half my time. i never knew days fly so fast. a week to-morrow!—and i have hardly begun to enjoy myself. but just got acquainted with mrs. weston, and others!—i hate the recollection.”
“perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day, out of so few, in having your hair cut.”
“no,” said he, smiling, “that is no subject of regret at all. i have no pleasure in seeing my friends, unless i can believe myself fit to be seen.”
the rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes, and listen to mr. cole. when mr. cole had moved away, and her attention coul

he was gone immediately; and emma soon saw him standing before miss fairfax, and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young lady, as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly in front of miss fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing.
before he could return to his chair, it was taken by mrs. weston.
“this is the luxury of a large party,” said she:—“one can get near every body, and say every thing. my dear emma, i am longing to talk to you. i have been making discoveries and forming plans, just like yourself, and i must tell them while the idea is fresh. do you know how miss bates and her niece came here?”
“how?—they were invited, were not they?”
“oh! yes—but how they were conveyed hither?—the manner of their coming?”
“they walked, i conclude. how else could they

“very true.—well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have jane fairfax walking home again, late at night, and cold as the nights are now. and as i looked at her, though i never saw her appear to more advantage, it struck me that she was heated, and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold. poor girl! i could not bear the idea of it; so, as soon as mr. weston came into the room, and i could get at him, i spoke to him about the carriage. you may guess how readily he came into my wishes; and having his approbation, i made my way directly to miss bates, to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home; for i thought it would be making her comfortable at once. good soul! she was as grateful as possible, you may be sure. ‘nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!’—but with many, many thanks—‘there was no occasion to

 the sort of thing—to do any thing really good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent. he is not a gallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this, considering jane fairfax’s ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him;—and for an act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom i would fix on more than on mr. knightley. i know he had horses to-day—for we arrived together; and i laughed at him about it, but he said not a word that could betray.”
“well,” said mrs. weston, smiling, “you give him credit for more simple, disinterested benevolence in this instance than i do; for while miss bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, and i have never been able to get it out again. the more i think of it, the more probable it appears. in short, i have made a match between mr. knightley and jane fairfax. see the consequence of keeping you company!—what do you say to it?”
“mr. knightley and jane fairfax!” exclaimed emma. “dear mrs. weston, how coul

“but the imprudence of such a match!”
“i am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability.”
“i see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation than what you mention. his good-nature, his humanity, as i tell you, would be quite enough to account for the horses. he has a great regard for the bateses, you know, independent of jane fairfax—and is always glad to shew them attention. my dear mrs. weston, do not take to match-making. you do it very ill. jane fairfax mistress of the abbey!—oh! no, no;—every feeling revolts. for his own sake, i would not have him do so mad a thing.”
“imprudent, if you please—but not mad. excepting inequality of fortune, and perhaps a little disparity of age, i can see nothing unsuitable.”
“but mr. knightley does not want to marry. i am sure he has not the least idea of it. do not put it into his head. why should he marry?—he is as happy as possibl

“my dear emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really loves jane fairfax—”
“nonsense! he does not care about jane fairfax. in the way of love, i am sure he does not. he would do any good to her, or her family; but—”
“well,” said mrs. weston, laughing, “perhaps the greatest good he could do them, would be to give jane such a respectable home.”
“if it would be good to her, i am sure it would be evil to himself; a very shameful and degrading connexion. how would he bear to have miss bates belonging to him?—to have her haunting the abbey, and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying jane?—‘so very kind and obliging!—but he always had been such a very kind neighbour!’ and then fly off, through half a

“i have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly; oftener than i should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common course of things, occur to him.”
“very well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would have told her so.”
“there might be scruples of delicacy, my dear emma. i have a very strong notion that it comes from him. i am sure he was particularly silent when mrs. cole told us of it at dinner.”
“you take up an idea, mrs. weston, and run away with it; as you have many a time reproached me with doing. i see no sign of attachment—i believe nothing of the pianoforte—and proof only shall convince me that mr. knightley has any thought of marrying jane fairfax.”
they combated the point some time longer in the same way; emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend; for mrs. weston was the most used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over, and the instrument in prepar

with mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument, to listen. frank churchill sang again. they had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at weymouth. but the sight of mr. knightley among the most attentive, soon drew away half emma’s mind; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of mrs. weston’s suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions. her objections to mr. knightley’s marrying did not in the least subside. she could see nothing but evil in it. it would be a great disappointment to mr. john knightley; consequently to isabella. a real injury to the children—a most mortifying change, and material loss to them all;—a very great deduction from her father’s daily comfort—and, as to herself, she could not at all endure the id

presently mr. knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her. they talked at first only of the performance. his admiration was certainly very warm; yet she thought, but for mrs. weston, it would not have struck her. as a sort of touchstone, however, she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short, she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own.

miss bates, in her real anxiety for jane, could hardly stay even to be grateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing. here ceased the concert part of the evening, for miss woodhouse and miss fairfax were the only young lady performers; but soon (within five minutes) the proposal of dancing—originating nobody exactly knew where—was so effectually promoted by mr. and mrs. cole, that every thing was rapidly clearing away, to give proper space. mrs. weston, capital in her country-dances, was seated, and beginning an irresistible waltz; and frank churchill, coming up with most becoming gallantry to emma, had secured her hand, and led her up to the top.
while waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off, emma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of mr. knightley. this would be a trial. he was no dancer in general. if he were to be very alert in enga

d she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment. not more than five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful, and she found herself well matched in a partner. they were a couple worth looking at.
two dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed. it was growing late, and miss bates became anxious to get home, on her mother’s account. after some attempts, therefore, to be permitted to begin again, they were obliged to thank mrs. weston, look sorrowful, and have done.
“perhaps it is as well,” said frank churchill, as he attended emma to her carriage. “i must have asked miss fairfax, and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me, after yours.”

h his tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket, two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone, and a string of dawdling children round the baker’s little bow-window eyeing the gingerbread, she knew she had no reason to complain, and was amused enough; quite enough still to stand at the door. a mind lively and at ease, can do with seeing nothing, and can see nothing that does not answer.
she looked down the randalls road. the scene enlarged; two persons appeared; mrs. weston and her son-in-law; they were walking into highbury;—to hartfield of course. they were stopping, however, in the first place at mrs. bates’s; whose house was a little nearer randalls than ford’s; and had all but knocked, when emma caught their eye.—immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her; and the agreeableness of yesterday’s engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting. mrs. weston informed her that she was going to call on the bateses, in order to

 hear the new instrument.
“for my companion tells me,” said she, “that i absolutely promised miss bates last night, that i would come this morning. i was not aware of it myself. i did not know that i had fixed a day, but as he says i did, i am going now.”
“and while mrs. weston pays her visit, i may be allowed, i hope,” said frank churchill, “to join your party and wait for her at hartfield—if you are going home.”
mrs. weston was disappointed.
“i thought you meant to go with me. they would be very much pleased.”
“me! i should be quite in the way. but, perhaps—i may be equally in the way here. miss woodhouse looks as if she did not want me. my aunt always sends me off when she is shopping. she says i fidget her to death; and miss woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same. what am i to do?”
“i am here on no business of my own,” said emma; “i am only waiting for my friend. she will probably ha

“well—if you advise it.—but (with a smile) if colonel campbell should have employed a careless friend, and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone—what shall i say? i shall be no support to mrs. weston. she might do very well by herself. a disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips, but i am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood.”
“i do not believe any such thing,” replied emma.—“i am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary; but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent. quite otherwise indeed, if i understood miss fairfax’s opinion last night.”
“do come with me,” said mrs. weston, “if

it be not very disagreeable to you. it need not detain us long. we will go to hartfield afterwards. we will follow them to hartfield. i really wish you to call with me. it will be felt so great an attention! and i always thought you meant it.”
he could say no more; and with the hope of hartfield to reward him, returned with mrs. weston to mrs. bates’s door. emma watched them in, and then joined harriet at the interesting counter,—trying, with all the force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon, be it ever so beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern. at last it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.
“should i send it to mrs. goddard’s, ma’am?” asked mrs. ford.—“yes—no—yes, to mrs. goddard’s

 you shall send it all to mrs. goddard’s—i do not know—no, i think, miss woodhouse, i may just as well have it sent to hartfield, and take it home with me at night. what do you advise?”
“that you do not give another half-second to the subject. to hartfield, if you please, mrs. ford.”
“aye, that will be much best,” said harriet, quite satisfied, “i should not at all like to have it sent to mrs. goddard’s.”
voices approached the shop—or rather one voice and two ladies: mrs. weston and miss bates met them at the door.
“my dear miss woodhouse,” said the latter, “i am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while, and give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and miss smith. how do you do, miss smith?—very well i thank you.—and i begged mrs. weston to come with me, that i might be sure of succeeding.”

emma would be “very happy to wait on mrs. bates, &c.,” and they did at last move out of the shop, with no farther delay from miss bates than,
“how do you do, mrs. ford? i beg your pardon. i did not see you before. i hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town. jane came back delighted yesterday. thank ye, the gloves do very well—only a little too large about the wrist; but jane is taking them in.”

emma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.
“i declare i cannot recollect what i was talking of.—oh! my mother’s spectacles. so very obliging of mr. frank churchill! ‘oh!’ said he, ‘i do think i can fasten the rivet; i like a job of this kind excessively.’—which you know shewed him to be so very.... indeed i must say that, much as i had heard of him before and much as i had expected, he very far exceeds any thing.... i do congratulate you, mrs. weston, most warmly. he seems every thing the fondest parent could.... ‘oh!’ said he, ‘i can fasten the rivet. i like a job of that sort excessively.’ i never shall forget his manner. and when i brought out the baked apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some, ‘oh!’ said he directly, ‘there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good, and these are the finest-looking home-baked apples i ever saw in my life.’ that, you know, was so very.... a

miss bates had just done as patty opened the door; and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to, pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will.
“pray take care, mrs. weston, there is a step at the turning. pray take care, miss woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase—rather darker and narrower than one could wish. miss smith, pray take care. miss woodhouse, i am quite concerned, i am sure you hit your foot. miss smith, the step at the turning.”

the appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered, was tranquillity itself; mrs. bates, deprived of her usual employment, slumbering on one side of the fire, frank churchill, at a table near her

, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and jane fairfax, standing with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte.
busy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing emma again.
“this is a pleasure,” said he, in rather a low voice, “coming at least ten minutes earlier than i had calculated. you find me trying to be useful; tell me if you think i shall succeed.”
“what!” said mrs. weston, “have not you finished it yet? you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate.”
“i have not been working uninterruptedly,” he replied, “i have been assisting miss fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily, it was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, i believe. you see we have been wedging one leg with paper. this was very kind of you to be persuaded to come. i was almost afraid you would be hurrying home.”
he contrived that she

hat she was not immediately ready, emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves; she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion; she must reason herself into the power of performance; and emma could not but pity such feelings, whatever their origin, and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again.
at last jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given, the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to. mrs. weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again; emma joined her in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every proper discrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise.
“whoever colonel campbell might employ,” said frank churchill, with a smile at emma, “the person has not chosen ill. i heard a good deal of colonel campbell’s taste at weymouth; and the softness of the upper notes i am sure is exactly what he and all that party would particularly prize. i dare

jane did not look round. she was not obliged to hear. mrs. weston had been speaking to her at the same moment.
“it is not fair,” said emma, in a whisper; “mine was a random guess. do not distress her.”
he shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy. soon afterwards he began again,
“how much your friends in ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion, miss fairfax. i dare say they often think of you, and wonder which will be the day, the precise day of the instrument’s coming to hand. do

so began miss bates; and mr. knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,
“how is your niece, miss bates?—i want to inquire after you all, but particularly your niece. how is miss fairfax?—i hope she caught no cold last night. how is she to-day? tell me how miss fairfax is.”
and miss bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear her in any thing else. the listeners were amused; and mrs. weston gave emma a look of particular meaning. but emma still shook her head in steady scepticism.
“so obliged to you!—so very much obliged to you for the carriage,” resumed miss bates.
he cut her short with,
“i am going to kingston. can i do any thing for you?”
“oh! dear, kingston—are you?—mrs. cole was saying the other day she wanted something from kingston.”
“mrs. cole has servants to send. can i do any thing for you?”
“no, i thank you. but do come in. who do you think is he

“well,” said he, in a deliberating manner, “for five minutes, perhaps.”
“and here is mrs. weston and mr. frank churchill too!—quite delightful; so many friends!”
“no, not now, i thank you. i could not stay two minutes. i must get on to kingston as fast as i can.”
“oh! do come in. they will be so very happy to see you.”
“no, no; your room is full enough. i will call another day, and hear the pianoforte.”

“oh! very delightful indeed; i can say nothing less, for i suppose miss woodhouse and mr. frank churchill are hearing every thing that passes. and (raising his voice still more) i do not see why miss fairfax should not be mentioned too. i think miss fairfax dances very well; and mrs. weston is the very best country-dance player, without exception, in england. now, if your friends have any gratitude, they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return; but i cannot stay to hear it.”
“oh! mr. knightley, one moment more; something of consequence—so shocked!—jane and i are both so shocked about the apples!”
“what is the matter now?”
“to think of your sending us all your store apples. you said you had a great many, and now you have not one left. we really are

emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already lasted long; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was perceived to be gone, that mrs. weston and her companion taking leave also, could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to hartfield gates, before they set off for randalls.

it may be possible to do without dancing entirely. instances have been known of young people passing many, many months successively, without being at any ball of any description, and no material injury accrue either to body or mind;—but when a beginning is made—when the felicities of rapid motion have once been, though sligh

earance. but still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully mr. frank churchill and miss woodhouse danced—for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with jane fairfax—and even for simple dancing itself, without any of the wicked aids of vanity—to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold—and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour, in the hope of discovering, in spite of all that mr. weston could say of their exactly equal size, that it was a little the largest.
his first proposition and request, that the dance begun at mr. cole’s should be finished there—that the same party should be collected, and the same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence. mr. weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment, and mrs. weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance; and the interesting employment had followed, of reckoning up exactly who th

somebody said that miss gilbert was expected at her brother’s, and must be invited with the rest. somebody else believed mrs. gilbert would have danced the other evening, if she had been asked. a word was put in for a second young cox; and at last, mr. weston naming one family of cousins who must be included, and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out, it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten, and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of.
the doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other. “might not they use both rooms, and dance across the passage?” it seemed the best scheme; and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a better. emma said it w

“oh! no,” said he; “it would be the extreme of imprudence. i could not bear it for emma!—emma is not strong. she would catch a dreadful cold. so would poor little harriet. so you would all. mrs. weston, you would be quite laid up; do not let them talk of such a wild thing. pray do not let them talk of it. that young man (speaking lower) is very thoughtless. do not tell his father, but that young man is not quite the thing. he has been opening the doors very often this evening, and keeping them open very inconsiderately. he does not think of the draught. i do not mean to set you against him, but indeed he is not quite the thing!”

“ah! sir—but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected. i have often known it done myself.”
“have you indeed, sir?—bless me! i never could have supposed it. but i live out of the world, and am often astonished at what i hear. however, this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come to talk it over—but these sort of things require a good deal of consi

“there, papa!—now you must be satisfied—our own dear mrs. weston, who is carefulness itself. do not you remember what mr. perry said, so many years ago, when i had the measles? ‘if miss taylor undertakes to wrap miss emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.’ how often have i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!”
“aye, very true. mr. perry did say so. i shall never forget it. poor little emma! you were very bad with the measles; that is, you would have been very bad, but for perry’s great attention. he came four times a day for a wee

“emma,” said she, “this paper is worse than i expected. look! in places you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing i could have imagined.”

being built, suppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining, was the only addition. what was to be done? this card-room would be wanted as a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves, still was it not too small for any comfortable supper? another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose; but it was at the other end of the house, and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it. this made a difficulty. mrs. weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage; and neither emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper.
mrs. weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches, &c., set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a wretched suggestion. a private dance, without sitting down to supper, was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women; and mrs. weston must not speak of it again. she then took another line of e

xpediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,
“i do not think it is so very small. we shall not be many, you know.”
and mr. weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps through the passage, was calling out,
“you talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear. it is a mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the stairs.”
“i wish,” said mrs. weston, “one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best. to do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object—if one could but tell what that would be.”
“yes, very true,” cried frank, “very true. you want your neighbours’ opinions. i do not wonder at you. if one could ascertain what the chief of them—the coles, for instance. they are not far off. shall i call upon them? or miss bates? she is still nearer.—and i do not know whether miss bates is not a

“well—if you please,” said mrs. weston rather hesitating, “if you think she will be of any use.”
“you will get nothing to the purpose from miss bates,” said emma. “she will be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you nothing. she will not even listen to your questions. i see no advantage in consulting miss bates.”
“but she is so amusing, so extremely amusing! i am very fond of hearing miss bates talk. and i need not bring the whole family, you know.”

“both sir! can the old lady?”...
“the old lady! no, the young lady, to be sure. i shall think you a great blockhead, frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece.”
“oh! i beg your pardon, sir. i did not immediately recollect. undoubtedly if you wish it, i will endeavour to persuade them both.” and away he ran.
long before he reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-moving aunt, and her elegant niece,—mrs. weston, like a sweet-tempered woman and a good wife, had examined the passage again, and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before—indeed very trifling; and here ended the difficulties of decision. all the rest, in speculation at least, was perfectly smooth. all the minor arrangements of table and chair, lights and music, tea and supper, made themselves; or were left as mere trifles to be settled at any time between mrs. weston and mrs. stokes.—every body invited, was certainly

sellor she was not wanted; but as an approver, (a much safer character,) she was truly welcome. her approbation, at once general and minute, warm and incessant, could not but please; and for another half-hour they were all walking to and fro, between the different rooms, some suggesting, some attending, and all in happy enjoyment of the future. the party did not break up without emma’s being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening, nor without her overhearing mr. weston whisper to his wife, “he has asked her, my dear. that’s right. i knew he would!”




chapter xii

one thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to emma—its being fixed for a day within the granted term of frank churchill’s stay in surry; for, in spite of mr. weston’s confidence, she could not think it so very impossible that the churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight. but this was not judged feasible. the pr

ly makes way for another, emma, being now certain of her ball, began to adopt as the next vexation mr. knightley’s provoking indifference about it. either because he did not dance himself, or because the plan had been formed without his being consulted, he seemed resolved that it should not interest him, determined against its exciting any present curiosity, or affording him any future amusement. to her voluntary communications emma could get no more approving reply, than,
“very well. if the westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, i have nothing to say against it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.—oh! yes, i must be there; i could not refuse; and i will keep as much awake as i can; but i would rather be at home, looking over william larkins’s week’s account; much rather, i confess.—pleasure in seeing dancing!—not i, indeed—i never look at it—i do not know who does.—fine dancing, i believe, like virtue, mu

 was not guided by her feelings in reprobating the ball, for she enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree. it made her animated—open hearted—she voluntarily said;—
“oh! miss woodhouse, i hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball. what a disappointment it would be! i do look forward to it, i own, with very great pleasure.”
it was not to oblige jane fairfax therefore that he would have preferred the society of william larkins. no!—she was more and more convinced that mrs. weston was quite mistaken in that surmise. there was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side—but no love.
alas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with mr. knightley. two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over-throw of every thing. a letter arrived from mr. churchill to urge his nephew’s instant return. mrs. churchill was unwell—far too unwell to do without him; she had been in a very suffering state (so said her husband) when writing to

 her nephew two days before, though from her usual unwillingness to give pain, and constant habit of never thinking of herself, she had not mentioned it; but now she was too ill to trifle, and must entreat him to set off for enscombe without delay.
the substance of this letter was forwarded to emma, in a note from mrs. weston, instantly. as to his going, it was inevitable. he must be gone within a few hours, though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt, to lessen his repugnance. he knew her illnesses; they never occurred but for her own convenience.
mrs. weston added, “that he could only allow himself time to hurry to highbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him; and that he might be expected at hartfield very soon.”

he stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.—he was more in love with her than emma had supposed; and who can say how it might have ended, if his father had not made his appearance? mr. woodhouse soon followed; and the necessity of exertion made him composed.
a very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial. mr. weston, always alert when business was to be done, and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable, as of foreseeing any that was doubtful, said, “it was time to go;” and the young man, though he might and did sigh, could not but agree, to take leave.
“i shall hear about you all,” said he; “that is my chief consolation. i shall hear of every thing that is going on among you. i have engaged mrs. weston to correspond with me. she has been so kind as to promise it. oh! the bles

chapter xiii

emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love. her ideas only varied as to the how much. at first, she thought it was a good deal; and afterwards, but little. she had great pleasure in hearing frank churchill talked of; and, for his sake, greater pleasure than ever in seeing mr. and mrs. weston; she was very often thinking of him, and quite impatient for a letter, that she might know how he was, how were his spirits, how was his aunt, and what was the chance of his coming to randalls again this spring. but, on the other hand, she could not admit herself to be unhappy, nor, after the first morning, to be less disposed for employment than usual; she was still busy and cheerful; and, pleasing as he was, she could yet imagine him to have faults; and farther, though thinking of him so much

when his letter to mrs. weston arrived, emma had the perusal of it; and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she had undervalued their strength. it was a long, well-written letter, giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings, expressing all the affection, gratitude, and respect which was natural and honourable, and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive, with spirit and precision. no su

spicious flourishes now of apology or concern; it was the language of real feeling towards mrs. weston; and the transition from highbury to enscombe, the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety.—the charm of her own name was not wanting. miss woodhouse appeared more than once, and never without a something of pleasing connexion, either a compliment to her taste, or a remembrance of what she had said; and in the very last time of

es and adieus to her.” this, emma could not doubt, was all for herself. harriet was remembered only from being her friend. his information and prospects as to enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated; mrs. churchill was recovering, and he dared not yet, even in his own imagination, fix a time for coming to randalls again.
gratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the material part, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up and returned to mrs. weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth, that she could still do without the writer, and that he must learn to do without her. her intentions were unchanged. her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness. his recollection of harriet, and the words which clothed it, the “beautiful little friend,” suggested to her the idea of harriet’s succeeding her in his affections. was it impossible?—no.—harriet undoub

 elton’s concerns were assuming the most irresistible form.—his wedding-day was named. he would soon be among them again; mr. elton and his bride. there was hardly time to talk over the first letter from enscombe before “mr. elton and his bride” was in every body’s mouth, and frank churchill was forgotten. emma grew sick at the sound. she had had three weeks of happy exemption from mr. elton; and harriet’s mind, she had been willing to hope, had been lately gaining strength. with mr. weston’s ball in view at least, there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things; but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual approach—new carriage, bell-ringing, and all.
poor harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that emma could give. emma felt that she could not do too much for her, that harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her p

“but every thing of that kind,” said emma, “will soon be in so regular a train—”
“well,” said mrs. elton, laughing, “we shall see.”
emma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music, had nothing more to say; and, after a moment’s pause, mrs. elton chose another subject.
“we have been calling at randalls,” said she, “and found them both at home; and very pleasant people they seem to be. i like them extremely. mr. weston seems an excellent creature—quite a first-rate favourite with me already, i assure you. and she appears so truly good—there is something so motherly and kind-hearted about her, that it wins upon one directly. she was your governess, i think?”
emma was almost too much astonished to answer; but mrs. elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on.
“having understood as much, i was rather astonished to find her so very lady-like! but she is really quite the gentlewoman.”
“mr

s. weston’s manners,” said emma, “were always particularly good. their propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest model for any young woman.”
“and who do you think came in while we were there?”
emma was quite at a loss. the tone implied some old acquaintance—and how could she possibly guess?
“knightley!” continued mrs. elton; “knightley himself!—was not it lucky?—for, not being within when he called the other day, i had never seen him before; and of course, as

life before, and call him knightley!—and discover that he is a gentleman! a little upstart, vulgar being, with her mr. e., and her caro sposo, and her resources, and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery. actually to discover that mr. knightley is a gentleman! i doubt whether he will return the compliment, and discover her to be a lady. i could not have believed it! and to propose that she and i should unite to form a musical club! one would fancy we were bosom friends! and mrs. weston!—astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman! worse and worse. i never met with her equal. much beyond my hopes. harriet is disgraced by any comparison. oh! what would frank churchill say to her, if he were here? how angry and how diverted he would be! ah! there i am—thinking of him directly. always the first person to be thought of! how i catch myself out! frank churchill comes as regularly into my mind!”—
all this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that b

than appears, for refusing this invitation,” was emma’s conclusion. “she must be under some sort of penance, inflicted either by the campbells or herself. there is great fear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.—she is not to be with the dixons. the decree is issued by somebody. but why must she consent to be with the eltons?—here is quite a separate puzzle.”
upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject, before the few who knew her opinion of mrs. elton, mrs. weston ventured this apology for jane.
“we cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the vicarage, my dear emma—but it is better than being always at home. her aunt is a good creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome. we must consider what miss fairfax quits, before we condemn her taste for what she goes to.”
“you are right, mrs. weston,” said mr. knightley warmly, “miss fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of mrs. elton. could she have

chosen with whom to associate, she would not have chosen her. but (with a reproachful smile at emma) she receives attentions from mrs. elton, which nobody else pays her.”
emma felt that mrs. weston was giving her a momentary glance; and she was herself struck by his warmth. with a faint blush, she presently replied,
“such attentions as mrs. elton’s, i should have imagined, would rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax. mrs. elton’s invitations i should have imagined any thing but inviting.”
“i should not wonder,” said mrs. weston, “if miss fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt’s eagerness in accepting mrs. elton’s civilities for her.

et, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is. the extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other.”
mr. knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick leather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together, or some other cause, brought the colour into his face, as he answered,
“oh! are you there?—but you are miserably behindhand. mr. cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago.”
he stopped.—emma felt her foot pressed by mrs. weston, and did not herself know what to think. in a moment he went on—
“that will never be, however, i can assure you. miss fairfax, i dare say, would not have me if i were to ask her—and i am very sure i shall never ask her.”
emma returned her friend’s pressure with interest; and was pleased enough to exclaim,
“you are not vain, mr. knightley. i will say that for you.”
he seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful—and in a manner which shewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said,

“in that respect how unlike dear mrs. elton, who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world! i wonder how she speaks of the coles—what she calls them! how can she find any appellation for them, deep enough in familiar vulgarity? she calls you, knightley—what can she do for mr. cole? and so i am not to be surprized that jane fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her. mrs. weston, your argument weighs most with me. i can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from miss bates, than i can believe in the triumph of miss fairfax’s mind over mrs. elton. i have no faith in mrs. elton’s acknowledging herself the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding. i cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that

“well, mrs. weston,” said emma triumphantly when he left them, “what do you say now to mr. knightley’s marrying jane fairfax?”
“why, really, dear emma, i say that he is so very much occupied by the idea of not being in love with her, that i should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last. do not beat me.”

the persons to be invited, required little thought. besides the eltons, it must be the westons and mr. knightley; so far it was all of course—and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little harriet must be asked to make the eighth:—but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction, and on many accounts emma was particularly pleased by harriet’s begging to be allowed to decline it. “she would rather not be in his company more than she could help. she was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together, without feeling uncomfortable. if miss woodhouse

 would not be displeased, she would rather stay at home.” it was precisely what emma would have wished, had she deemed it possible enough for wishing. she was delighted with the fortitude of her little friend—for fortitude she knew it was in her to give up being in company and stay at home; and she could now invite the very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth, jane fairfax.— since her last conversation with mrs. weston and mr. knightley, she was more conscience-stricken about jane fairfax than she had often been.—mr. knightley’s words dwelt with her. he had said that jane fairfax received attentions from mrs. elton which nobody else paid her.
“this is very true,” said she, “at least as far as relates to me, which was all that was meant—and it is very shameful.—of the same age—and always knowing her—i ought to have been more her friend.—she will never like me now. i have neglected her too l

she comforted her father better than she could comfort herself, by representing that though he certainly would make them nine, yet he always said so little, that the increase of noise would be very immaterial. she thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself, to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother.
the event was more favourable to mr. woodhouse than to emma. john knightley came; but mr. weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day. he might be able to join them in the evening, but certainly not to dinner. mr. woodhouse was quite at ease; and the seeing him so, with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate, removed the chief of even emma’s vexation.
the day came, the party were punctually assembled, and mr. john knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable. instead of

“my dear jane, what is this i hear?—going to the post-office in the rain!—this must not be, i assure you.—you sad girl, how could you do such a thing?—it is a sign i was not there to take care of you.”
jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold.
“oh! do not tell me. you really are a very sad girl, and do not know how to take care of yourself.—to the post-office indeed! mrs. weston, did you ever hear the like? you and i must positively exert our authority.”
“my advice,” said mrs. weston kindly and persuasively, “i certainly do feel tempted to give. miss fairfax, you must not run such risks.—liable as you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought to be particularly careful, especially at this time of year. the spring i always think requires more than common care. better wait an hour or two, or even half a day for your letters, than run the risk of bringing on y

“you are extremely kind,” said jane; “but i cannot give up my early walk. i am advised to be out of doors as much as i can, i must walk somewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon my word, i have scarcely ever had a bad morning before.”
“my dear jane, say no more about it. the thing is determined, that is (laughing affectedly) as far as i can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master. you know, mrs. weston, you and i must be cautious how we express ourselves. but i do flatter myself, my dear jane, that my influence is not entirely worn out. if i meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore, consider that point as settled.”
“excuse me,” said jane earnestly, “i cannot by any means consent to such an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant. if the errand were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it always is when i am not here, by my grandmama’s.”
“oh! my dear;

“yes,” said his brother hesitatingly, “there is a likeness. i know what you mean—but emma’s hand is the strongest.”
“isabella and emma both write beautifully,” said mr. woodhouse; “and always did. and so does poor mrs. weston”—with half a sigh and half a smile at her.
“i never saw any gentleman’s handwriting”—emma began, looking also at mrs. weston; but stopped, on perceiving that mrs. weston was attending to some one else—and the pause gave her time to reflect, “now, how am i going to introduce him?—am i unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people? is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase?—your yorkshire friend—your correspondent in yorkshire;—that would be the wa

mrs. weston was disengaged and emma began again—“mr. frank churchill writes one of the best gentleman’s hands i ever saw.”
“i do not admire it,” said mr. knightley. “it is too small—wants strength. it is like a woman’s writing.”
this was not submitted to by either lady. they vindicated him against the base aspersion. “no, it by no means wanted strength—it was not a large hand, but very clear and certainly strong. had not mrs. weston any letter about her to produce?” no, she had he

“he chose to say he was employed”—
“well, well, i have that note; and can shew it after dinner to convince mr. knightley.”

when the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, emma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;—with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did mrs. elton engross jane fairfax and slight herself. she and mrs. weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together. mrs. elton left them no choice. if jane repressed her for a little time, she soon began again; and though much that passed between them was in a half-whisper, especially on mrs. elton’s side, there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects: the post-office—catching cold—fetching letters—and friendship, were long under discussion; and to them succeeded one, which must be at least equally unpleasant

ow, because it is expected of me. a bride, you know, must appear like a bride, but my natural taste is all for simplicity; a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery. but i am quite in the minority, i believe; few people seem to value simplicity of dress,—show and finery are every thing. i have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin. do you think it will look well?”
the whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room when mr. weston made his appearance among them. he had returned to a late dinner, and walked to hartfield as soon as it was over. he had been too much expected by the best judges, for surprize—but there was great joy. mr. woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now, as he would have been sorry to see him before. john knightley only was in mute astonishment.—that a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in london, should set off again, and walk half a mile to another ma

mr. weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all the right of being principal talker, which a day spent anywhere from home confers, was making himself agreeable among the rest; and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner, convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten, and spread abroad what public news he had heard, was proceeding to a family communication, which, thoug

h principally addressed to mrs. weston, he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room. he gave her a letter, it was from frank, and to herself; he had met with it in his way, and had taken the liberty of opening it.
“read it, read it,” said he, “it will give you pleasure; only a few lines—will not take you long; read it to emma.”
the two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued, but very audible to every body.

mrs. weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion. her looks and words had nothing to restrain them. she was happy, she knew she was happy, and knew she ought to be happy. her congratulations were warm and open; but emma could not speak so fluently. she was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings, and trying to understand the degree of her agitation, which she rather thought was considerable.
mr. weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative to want others to talk, was ve

it was well that he took every body’s joy for granted, or he might not have thought either mr. woodhouse or mr. knightley particularly delighted. they were the first entitled, after mrs. weston and emma, to be made happy;—from them he would have proceeded to miss fairfax, but she was so deep in conversation with john knightley, that it would have been too positive an interruption; and finding himself close to mrs. elton, and her attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the subject with her.

“and so you absolutely opened what was directed to her! oh! mr. weston—(laughing affectedly) i must protest against that.—a most dangerous precedent indeed!—i beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example.—upon my word, if this is what i am to expect, we married women must begin to exert ourselves!—oh! mr. weston, i could not have believed it of you!”
“aye, we men are sad fellows. you mu

 that they are all coming up to town directly, on mrs. churchill’s account—she has not been well the whole winter, and thinks enscombe too cold for her—so they are all to move southward without loss of time.”
“indeed!—from yorkshire, i think. enscombe is in yorkshire?”
“yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from london, a considerable journey.”
“yes, upon my word, very considerable. sixty-five miles farther than from maple grove to london. but what is distance, mr. weston, to people of large fortune?—you would be amazed to hear how my brother, mr. suckling, sometimes flies about. you will hardly believe me—but twice in one week he and mr. bragge went to london and back again with four horses.”
“the evil of the distance from enscombe,” said mr. weston, “is, that mrs. churchill, as we understand, has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together. in frank’s last letter she complained, he said, of being too weak to get into her conservatory with

to sleeping at an inn, you would not wonder at mrs. churchill’s making incredible exertions to avoid it. selina says it is quite horror to her—and i believe i have caught a little of her nicety. she always travels with her own sheets; an excellent precaution. does mrs. churchill do the same?”
“depend upon it, mrs. churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did. mrs. churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for”—
mrs. elton eagerly interposed with,
“oh! mr. weston, do not mistake me. selina is no fine lady, i assure you. do not run away with such an idea.”
“is not she? then she is no rule for mrs. churchill, who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld.”
mrs. elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly. it was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was not a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it;—and she was considering in what way she had best retract, when mr. weston

 went on.
“mrs. churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect—but this is quite between ourselves. she is very fond of frank, and therefore i would not speak ill of her. besides, she is out of health now; but that indeed, by her own account, she has always been. i would not say so to every body, mrs. elton, but i have not much faith in mrs. churchill’s illness.”
“if she is really ill, why not go to bath, mr. weston?—to bath, or to clifton?” “she has taken it into her head that enscombe is too cold for her. the fact is, i suppose, that she is tired of enscombe. she has now been a longer time stationary there, than she ever was before, and she begins to want change. it is a retired place. a fine place, but very retired.”
“aye—like maple grove, i dare say. nothing can stand more retired from the road than maple grove. such an immense plantation all round it! you seem shut out from every thing—i

s say a woman cannot have too many resources—and i feel very thankful that i have so many myself as to be quite independent of society.”
“frank was here in february for a fortnight.”
“so i remember to have heard. he will find an addition to the society of highbury when he comes again; that is, if i may presume to call myself an addition. but perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world.”
this was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by, and mr. weston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,
“my dear madam! nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible. not heard of you!—i believe mrs. weston’s letters lately have been full of very little else than mrs. elton.”
he had done his duty and could return to his son.
“when frank left us,” continued he, “it was quite uncertain when we might see him again, which makes this day’s news doubly welcome. it has been completely unexpected. that is, i always had a strong per

suasion he would be here again soon, i was sure something favourable would turn up—but nobody believed me. he and mrs. weston were both dreadfully desponding. ‘how could he contrive to come? and how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again?’ and so forth—i always felt that something would happen in our favour; and so it has, you see. i have observed, mrs. elton, in the course of my life, that if things are going untowardly one month, they are sure to mend the next.”
“very true, mr. weston, perfectly true. it is just what i used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of

 things did not go quite right, did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings, he was apt to be in despair, and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be may before hymen’s saffron robe would be put on for us. oh! the pains i have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views! the carriage—we had disappointments about the carriage;—one morning, i remember, he came to me quite in despair.”
she was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and mr. weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on.
“you were mentioning may. may is the very month which mrs. churchill is ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place than enscombe—in short, to spend in london; so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from frank the whole spring—precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it: days almost at the longest; weather genial and pleasant, always inviting one out, and never too hot for exercise

 enjoyment; and i do not know, mrs. elton, whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to-day or to-morrow, and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house. i think it is so. i think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight. i hope you will be pleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy. he is generally thought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy. mrs. weston’s partiality for him is very great, and, as you may suppose, most gratifying to me. she thinks nobody equal to him.”
“and i assure you, mr. weston, i have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour. i have heard so much in praise of mr. frank churchill.—at the same time it is fair to observe, that i am one of those who always judge for themselves, and are by no means implicitly guided by others. i give you notice that as i find your son, so i shall judge of him.

i am no flatterer.”
mr. weston was musing.
“i hope,” said he presently, “i have not been severe upon poor mrs. churchill. if she is ill i should be sorry to do her injustice; but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to speak of her with the forbearance i could wish. you cannot be ignorant, mrs. elton, of my connexion with the family, nor of the treatment i have met with; and, between ourselves, the whole blame of it is to be laid to her. she was the instigator. frank’s mother would ne

 the airs they give themselves! your description of mrs. churchill made me think of them directly. people of the name of tupman, very lately settled there, and encumbered with many low connexions, but giving themselves immense airs, and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families. a year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at west hall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows. they came from birmingham, which is not a place to promise much, you know, mr. weston. one has not great hopes from birmingham. i always say there is something direful in the sound: but nothing more is positively known of the tupmans, though a good many things i assure you are suspected; and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother, mr. suckling, who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours. it is infinitely too bad. mr. suckling, who has been eleven years a resident at maple grove, and whose father had it before him—i believe, at leas

they were interrupted. tea was carrying round, and mr. weston, having said all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of walking away.
after tea, mr. and mrs. weston, and mr. elton sat down with mr. woodhouse to cards. the remaining five were left to their own powers, and emma doubted their getting on very well; for mr. knightley seemed little disposed for conversation; mrs. elton was wanting notice, which nobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent.
mr. john knightley proved more talkative than his brother. he was to leave them early the next day; and he soon began with—

she wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration. that would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance! and yet, she could not help rather anticipating something decisive. she felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis, an event, a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state.
it was not very long, though rather longer than mr. weston had foreseen, before she had the power of forming some opinion of frank churchill’s feelings. the enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined, but he was at highbury very soon afterwards. he rode down for a couple of hours; he could not yet do more; but as he came from randalls immediately to hartfield, she could then exercise all her quick observation, and speedily determine how he was influenced, and how she must act. they met with the utmost friendliness. there coul

or the place. a ready-furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged, and much benefit expected from the change.
emma heard that frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement, and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends—for the house was taken for may and june. she was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them, almost as often as he could even wish.
emma saw how mr. weston understood these joyous prospects. he was considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered. she hoped it was not so. two months must bring it to the proof.
mr. weston’s own happiness was indisputable. he was quite delighted. it was the very circumstance he could have wished for. now, it would be really having frank in their neighbourhood. what were nine miles to a young man?—an hour’s ride. he would be always coming over. the difference in that respect of richmond and londo

y this removal,—the ball at the crown. it had not been forgotten before, but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day. now, however, it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, and very soon after the churchills had removed to richmond, a few lines from frank, to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change, and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty-four hours at any given time, induced them to name as early a day as possible.
mr. weston’s ball was to be a real thing. a very few to-morrows stood between the young people of highbury and happiness.
mr. woodhouse was resigned. the time of year lightened the evil to him. may was better for every thing than february. mrs. bates was engaged to spend the evening at hartfield, james had due notice, and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little henry nor dear little john would have any thing the matter with them, while dear emma were gone.

ain to prevent the ball. the day approached, the day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching, frank churchill, in all the certainty of his own self, reached randalls before dinner, and every thing was safe.
no second meeting had there yet been between him and emma. the room at the crown was to witness it;—but it would be better than a common meeting in a crowd. mr. weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves, for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came, that she could not refuse him, and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man’s company. she was to convey harriet, and they drove to the crown in good time, the randalls party just sufficiently before them.
frank churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and th

ough he did not say much, his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening. they all walked about together, to see that every thing was as it should be; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage, which emma could not hear the sound of at first, without great surprize. “so unreasonably early!” she was going to exclaim; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends, who were coming, like herself, by particular desire, to help mr. weston’s judgment; and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins, who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness, on the same errand, that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection.
emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which mr. weston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very f

, but a little less of open-heartedness would have made him a higher character.—general benevolence, but not general friendship, made a man what he ought to be.—she could fancy such a man. the whole party walked about, and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing else to do, formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe in their various modes, till other subjects were started, that, though may, a fire in the evening was still very pleasant.
emma found that it was not mr. weston’s fault that the number of privy councillors was not yet larger. they had stopped at mrs. bates’s door to offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the eltons.
frank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness, which shewed a mind not at ease. he was looking about, he was going to the door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,—impatient to begin, or afraid of being always near her.
mrs. elton was spoken of. “i think sh

 must be here soon,” said he. “i have a great curiosity to see mrs. elton, i have heard so much of her. it cannot be long, i think, before she comes.”
a carriage was heard. he was on the move immediately; but coming back, said,
“i am forgetting that i am not acquainted with her. i have never seen either mr. or mrs. elton. i have no business to put myself forward.”
mr. and mrs. elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed.
“but miss bates and miss fairfax!” said mr. weston, looking about. “we thought you were to bring them.”
the mistake had been slight. the carriage was sent for them now. emma longed to know what frank’s first opinion of mrs. elton might be; how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress, and her smiles of graciousness. he was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion, by giving her very proper attention, after the introduction had passed.
in a few minutes the carriage returned.—somebody talked of rain.—“i will see t

hat there are umbrellas, sir,” said frank to his father: “miss bates must not be forgotten:” and away he went. mr. weston was following; but mrs. elton detained him, to gratify him by her opinion of his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young man himself, though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing.
“a very fine young man indeed, mr. weston. you know i candidly told you i should form my own opinion; and i am happy to say that i am extremely pleased with him.—you may believe me. i never compliment. i think him a very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely what i like and approve—so truly the gentleman, without the least conceit or puppyism. you must know i have a vast dislike to puppies—quite a horror of them. they were never tolerated at maple grove. neither mr. suckling nor me had ever any patience with them; and

 we used sometimes to say very cutting things! selina, who is mild almost to a fault, bore with them much better.”
while she talked of his son, mr. weston’s attention was chained; but when she got to maple grove, he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.
mrs. elton turned to mrs. weston. “i have no doubt of its being our carriage with miss bates and jane. our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious!—i believe we drive faster than any body.—what a pleasure it is to send one’s carriage for a friend!—i understand you were so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quite unnecessary. you may be very sure i shall always take care of them.”
miss bates and miss fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walked into the room; and mrs. elton seemed to think it a

s much her duty as mrs. weston’s to receive them. her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like emma; but her words, every body’s words, were soon lost under the incessant flow of miss bates, who came in talking, and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire. as the door opened she was heard,
“so very obliging of you!—no rain at all. nothing to signify. i do not care for myself. quite thick shoes. and jane declares—well!—(as

jane on her dress and look, compliments very quietly and properly taken, mrs. elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself—and it was, “how do you like my gown?—how do you like my trimming?—how has wright done my hair?”—with many other relative questions, all answered with patient politeness. mrs. elton then said, “nobody can think less of dress in general than i do—but upon such an occasion as this, when every body’s eyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to the westons—who i have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour—i would not wish to be inferior to others. and i see very few pearls in the room except mine.—so frank churchill is a capital dancer, i understand.—we shall see if our styles suit.—a fine young man certainly is frank churchill. i like him very well.”
at this moment frank began talking so vigorously, that emma could not but imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want to hear more;—and the voices of the

“how do you like mrs. elton?” said emma in a whisper.
“not at all.”
“you are ungrateful.”
“ungrateful!—what do you mean?” then changing from a frown to a smile—“no, do not tell me—i do not want to know what you mean.—where is my father?—when are we to begin dancing?”
emma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour. he walked off to find his father, but was quickly back again with both mr. and mrs. weston. he had met with them in a little perplexity, which must be laid before emma. it had just occurred to mrs. weston that mrs. elton must be asked to begin the ball; that she would expect it; which interfered with all their wishes of giving emma that distinction.—emma heard the sad truth with fortitude.
“and what are we to do for a proper partner for her?” said mr. weston. “she will think frank ought to ask her.”
frank turned instantly to emma, to claim her former promise; and boasted hi

mself an engaged man, which his father looked his most perfect approbation of—and it then appeared that mrs. weston was wanting him to dance with mrs. elton himself, and that their business was to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.—mr. weston and mrs. elton led the way, mr. frank churchill and miss woodhouse followed. emma must submit to stand second to mrs. elton, though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her. it was almost enough to make her think of marrying. mrs. elton had undoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified; for though she had intended to begin with frank churchill, she could not lose by the change. mr. weston might be his son’s superior.—in spite of this little rub, how

 a ballroom better, and could like frank churchill better.—he seemed often observing her. she must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour, she did not feel afraid. there was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner. they seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers. that frank churchill thought less of her than he had done, was indubitable.
the ball proceeded pleasantly. the anxious cares, the incessant attentions of mrs. weston, were not thrown away. every body seemed happy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this. of very important, very recordable events, it was not more productive than such meetings usually are. there was one, however, which emma thought something of.—the two last dances before supper were begun, and harriet had no partner;—the only young lady sitting down;—and s

times directly before miss smith, or speaking to those who were close to her.—emma saw it. she was not yet dancing; she was working her way up from the bottom, and had therefore leisure to look around, and by only turning her head a little she saw it all. when she was half-way up the set, the whole group were exactly behind her, and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch; but mr. elton was so near, that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and mrs. weston; and she perceived that his wife, who was standing immediately above her, was not only listening also, but even encouraging him by significant glances.—the kind-hearted, gentle mrs. weston had left her seat to join him and say, “do not you dance, mr. elton?” to which his prompt reply was, “most readily, mrs. weston, if you will dance with me.”
“me!—oh! no—i would get you a better partner than myself. i am no dancer.”
“if mrs. gilbert wishes to dance,” said he, “i shall h

“mrs. gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady disengaged whom i should be very glad to see dancing—miss smith.” “miss smith!—oh!—i had not observed.—you are extremely obliging—and if i were not an old married man.—but my dancing days are over, mrs. weston. you will excuse me. any thing else i should be most happy to do, at your command—but my dancing days are over.”
mrs. weston said no more; and emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat. this was mr. elton! the amiable, obliging, gentle mr. elton.—she looked round for a moment; he had joined mr. knightley at a little distance, and was arranging himself for settled conversation, while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife.

supper was announced. the move began; and miss bates might be heard from that moment, without interruption, till her being seated at table and taking up her spoon.
“jane, jane, my dear jane, where are you?—here is your tippet. mrs. weston begs you to put on your tippet. she says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage, though every thing has been done—one door nailed up—quantities of matting—my dear jane, indeed you must. mr. churchill, oh! you are too obliging! how well you put it on!—so gratified! excellent dancing indeed!—yes, my dear, i ran home, as i said i should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and nobody missed me.—i set off without saying a word, just as i told you. grandmama was qu

nd, in return for your acknowledging so much, i will do you the justice to say, that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself.—harriet smith has some first-rate qualities, which mrs. elton is totally without. an unpretending, single-minded, artless girl—infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as mrs. elton. i found harriet more conversable than i expected.”
emma was extremely gratified.—they were interrupted by the bustle of mr. weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.
“come miss woodhouse, miss otway, miss fairfax, what are you all doing?—come emma, set your companions the example. every body is lazy! every body is asleep!”
“i am ready,” said emma, “whenever i am wanted.”
“whom are you going to dance with?” asked mr. knightley.
she hesitated a moment, and then replied, “with you, if you will ask me.”
“will you?” said he, offering his hand.
“indeed i will. you have shewn that you can da

brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking, of private understanding even, between frank churchill and jane.
he had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did, to spend his evening at hartfield. emma and harriet were going to walk; he joined them; and, on returning, they fell in with a larger party, who, like themselves, judged it wisest to take their exercise early, as the weather threatened rain; mr. and mrs. weston and their son, miss bates and her niece, who had accidentally met. they all united; and, on reaching hartfield gates, emma, who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father, pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him. the randalls party agreed to it immediately; and after a pretty long speech from miss bates, which few persons listened to, she also found it possible to accept dear miss woodhouse’s most obliging invitation.

ounds, mr. perry passed by on horseback. the gentlemen spoke of his horse.
“by the bye,” said frank churchill to mrs. weston presently, “what became of mr. perry’s plan of setting up his carriage?”
mrs. weston looked surprized, and said, “i did not know that he ever had any such plan.”
“nay, i had it from you. you wrote me word of it three months ago.”
“me! impossible!”
“indeed you did. i remember it perfectly. you mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon. mrs. perry had told somebody, and was extremely happy about it. it was owing to her persuasion, as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm. you must remember it now?”
“upon my word i never h

“never! really, never!—bless me! how could it be?—then i must have dreamt it—but i was completely persuaded—miss smith, you walk as if you were tired. you will not be sorry to find yourself at home.”
“what is this?—what is this?” cried mr. weston, “about perry and a carriage? is perry going to set up his carriage, frank? i am glad he can afford it. you had it from himself, had you?”
“no, sir,” replied his son, laughing, “i seem to have had it from nobody.—very odd!—i really was persuaded of mrs. weston’s having mentioned it in one of her letters to enscombe, many weeks ago, with all these particulars—but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before, of course it must have been a dream. i am a great dreamer.

t, out of care for his health—just what will happen, i have no doubt, some time or other; only a little premature. what an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream! and at others, what a heap of absurdities it is! well, frank, your dream certainly shews that highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent. emma, you are a great dreamer, i think?”
emma was out of hearing. she had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach of mr. weston’s hint.
“why, to own the truth,” cried miss bates, who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes, “if i must speak on this subject, there is no denying that mr. frank churchill might have—i do not mean to say that he did not dream it—i am sure i have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world—but if i am questioned about it, i must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring; for mrs. perry herself mentioned it to my mother, and the coles knew of it as well as

they were entering the hall. mr. knightley’s eyes had preceded miss bates’s in a glance at jane. from frank churchill’s face, where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he had involuntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind, and too busy with her shawl. mr. weston had walked in. the two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass. mr. knightley suspected in frank churchill the determination of catching her eye—he seemed watching her intently—in vain, however, if it were so—jane passed between them into the hall, and looked at neither.
there was no time for farther remark or explanation. the dream must be borne with, and mr. knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which emma had introduced at hartfield

emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves. they were rapidly forming words for each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled. the quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for mr. woodhouse, who had often been distressed by the more animated sort, which mr. weston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure of the “poor little boys,” or in fondly pointing out, as he took up any stray letter near him, how beautifully emma had written it.
frank churchill placed a word before miss fairfax. she gave a slight glance round the table, and applied herself to it. frank was next to emma, jane opposite to them—and mr. knightley so placed as to see them all; and it was his object to see

 mrs. suckling, the highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn. no such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at present. in the daily interchange of news, they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the sucklings’ coming had been united, such as the last accounts of mrs. churchill, whose health seemed every day to supply a different report, and the situation of mrs. weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child, as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it.
mrs. elton was very much disappointed. it was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and parade. her introductions and recommendations must all wait, and every projected party be still only talked of. so she thought at first;—but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off. why should not they explore to box

hill though the sucklings did not come? they could go there again with them in the autumn. it was settled that they should go to box hill. that there was to be such a party had been long generally known: it had even given the idea of another. emma had never been to box hill; she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing, and she and mr. weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither. two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to be done in a quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation, the regular eating and drinking, and picnic parade of the eltons and the sucklings.
this was so very well understood between them, that emma could not but feel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing from mr. weston that he had been proposing to m

rs. elton, as her brother and sister had failed her, that the two parties should unite, and go together; and that as mrs. elton had very readily acceded to it, so it was to be, if she had no objection. now, as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of mrs. elton, of which mr. weston must already be perfectly aware, it was not worth bringing forward again:—it could not be done without a reproof to him, which would be giving pain to his wife; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid; an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of mrs. elton’s party! every feeling was offended; and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of s

ecret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of mr. weston’s temper.
“i am glad you approve of what i have done,” said he very comfortably. “but i thought you would. such schemes as these are nothing without numbers. one cannot have too large a party. a large party secures its own amusement. and she is a good-natured woman after all. one could not leave her out.”
emma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.

le with mr. weston as to pigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty. it might be weeks, it might be only a few days, before the horse were useable; but no preparations could be ventured on, and it was all melancholy stagnation. mrs. elton’s resources were inadequate to such an attack.
“is not this most vexatious, knightley?” she cried.—“and such weather for exploring!—these delays and disappointments are quite odious. what are we to do?—the year will

“you had better explore to donwell,” replied mr. knightley. “that may be done without horses. come, and eat my strawberries. they are ripening fast.”
if mr. knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so, for his proposal was caught at with delight; and the “oh! i should like it of all things,” was not plainer in words than manner. donwell was famous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for the invitation: but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would ha

“oh! now you are looking very sly. but consider—you need not be afraid of delegating power to me. i am no young lady on her preferment. married women, you know, may be safely authorised. it is my party. leave it all to me. i will invite your guests.”
“no,”—he calmly replied,—“there is but one married woman in the world whom i can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to donwell, and that one is—”
“—mrs. weston, i suppose,” interrupted mrs. elton, rather mortified.
“no—mrs. knightley;—and till she is in being, i will manage such matters myself.”
“ah! you are an odd creature!” she cried, satisfied to have no one preferred to herself.—“you are a humourist, and may say what you like. quite a humourist. well, i shall bring jane with me—jane and her aunt.—the rest i leave to you. i have no objections at all to meeting the hartfield family. don’t scruple. i know you are attached to t

; and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him ill. mr. woodhouse must not, under the specious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two spent at donwell, be tempted away to his misery.
he was invited on good faith. no lurking horrors were to upbraid him for his easy credulity. he did consent. he had not been at donwell for two years. “some very fine morning, he, and emma, and harriet, could go very well; and he could sit still with mrs. weston, while the dear girls walked about the gardens. he did not suppose they could be damp now, in the middle of the day. he should like to see the old house again exceedingly, and should be very happy to meet mr. and mrs. elton, and any other of his neighbours.—he could not see any objection at all to his, and emma’s, and harriet’s going there some very fine morning. he thought it very well done of mr. knightley to invite them—very kind and sensible—much cleverer than dining out.—he was

 not fond of dining out.”
mr. knightley was fortunate in every body’s most ready concurrence. the invitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if, like mrs. elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves.—emma and harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it; and mr. weston, unasked, promised to get frank over to join them, if possible; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with.—mr. knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him; and mr. weston engaged to lose no time in writing, and spare no arguments to induce him to come.
in the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party to box hill was again under happy consideration; and at last donwell was settled for one day, and box hill for the next,

the weather appearing exactly right.
under a bright mid-day sun, at almost midsummer, mr. woodhouse was safely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down, to partake of this al-fresco party; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the abbey, especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning, he was happily placed, quite at his ease, ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved, and advise every body to come and sit down, and not to heat themselves.—mrs. weston, who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired, and sit all the time with him, remained, when all the others were invited or persuaded out, his patient listener and sympathiser.
it was so long since emma had been at the abbey, that as soon as she was satisfied of her father’s comfort, she was glad to leave him, and look around her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular observation, more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be so interestin

such, for half an hour, was the conversation—interrupted only once by mrs. weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her son-in-law, to inquire if he were come—and she was a little uneasy.—she had some fears of his horse.
seats tolerably in the shade were found; and now emma was obliged to overhear what mrs. elton and jane fairfax were talking of.—a situation, a most desirable situation, was in question. mrs. elton had received notice of it that morning, and was in raptures. it was not with mrs. suckling, it was not with mrs. bragge, but in felicity and splendour i

quired a steeper form beyond its grounds; and at half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur, well clothed with wood;—and at the bottom of this bank, favourably placed and sheltered, rose the abbey mill farm, with meadows in front, and the river making a close and handsome curve around it.
it was a sweet view—sweet to the eye and the mind. english verdure, english culture, english comfort, seen under a sun bright, without being oppressive.
in this walk emma and mr. weston found all the others assembled; and towards this view she immediately perceived mr. knightley and harriet distinct from the rest, quietly leading the way. mr. knightley and harriet!—it was an odd tete-a-tete; but she was glad to see it.—there had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion, and turned from her with little ceremony. now they seemed in pleasant conversation. there had been a time also when emma would have been sorry to see harriet in a spot so favourable for the

my own concerns. i have a right to talk on such subjects, without being suspected of introducing robert martin.”—she did not suspect him. it was too old a story.—robert martin had probably ceased to think of harriet.—they took a few turns together along the walk.—the shade was most refreshing, and emma found it the pleasantest part of the day.
the next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;—and they were all seated and busy, and still frank churchill did not come. mrs. weston looked, and looked in vain. his father would not own himself uneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare. he had expressed himself as to coming, with more than common certainty. “his aunt was so much better, that he had not a doubt of getting over to them.”—mrs. churchill’s state, however, as many were ready to remind her, was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependenc

e—and mrs. weston was at last persuaded to believe, or to say, that it must be by some attack of mrs. churchill that he was prevented coming.—emma looked at harriet while the point was under consideration; she behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.
the cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more to see what had not yet been seen, the old abbey fish-ponds; perhaps get as far as the clover, which was to be begun cutting on the morrow, or, at any rate, have the pleasure of being hot, and gro

mr. knightley had done all in his power for mr. woodhouse’s entertainment. books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos, corals, shells, and every other family collection within his cabinets, had been prepared for his old friend, to while away the morning; and the kindness had perfectly answered. mr. woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused. mrs. weston had been shewing them all to him, an

“such a home, indeed! such an aunt!” said emma, as she turned back into the hall again. “i do pity you. and the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors, the more i shall like you.”
jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only accomplished some views of st. mark’s place, venice, when frank churchill entered the room. emma had not been thinking of him, she had forgotten to think of him—but she was very glad to see him. mrs. weston would be at ease. the black mare was blameless; they were right who had named mrs. churchill as the cause. he had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her; a nervous seizure, which had lasted some hours—and he had quite given up every thought of coming, till very late;—and had he known how hot a ride he should have, and how late, with all his hurry, he must be, he believed he should not have come at all. the heat was excessive; he had never suffered any thing like it—almost

me, they parted. frank churchill’s little inclination to exclude himself increased so much, that his last words to emma were,
“well;—if you wish me to stay and join the party, i will.”
she smiled her acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from richmond was to take him back before the following evening.




chapter vii

they had a very fine day for box hill; and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were in favour of a pleasant party. mr. weston directed the whole, officiating safely between hartfield and the vicarage, and every body was in good time. emma and harriet went together; miss bates and her niece, with the eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. mrs. weston remained with mr. woodhouse. nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there. seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency. there was a lan

guor, a want of spirits, a want of union, which could not be got over. they separated too much into parties. the eltons walked together; mr. knightley took charge of miss bates and jane; and emma and harriet belonged to frank churchill. and mr. weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise better. it seemed at first an accidental division, but it never materially varied. mr. and mrs. elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness to mix, and be as agreeable as they could; but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill, there seemed a principle of separation, between the other parties, too strong for any fine prospects, or any cold collation, or any cheerful mr. weston, to remove.
at first it was downright dulness to emma. she had never s

mrs. elton swelled at the idea of miss woodhouse’s presiding; mr. knightley’s answer was the most distinct.
“is miss woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of?”
“oh! no, no”—cried emma, laughing as carelessly as she could—“upon no account in the world. it is the very last thing i would stand the brunt of just now. let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of. i will not say quite all. there are one or two, perhaps, (glancing at mr. weston and harriet,) whose thoughts i might not be afraid of knowing.”
“it is a sort of thing,” cried mrs. elton emphatically, “which i should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into. though, perhaps, as the chaperon of the party—i never was in any circle—exploring parties—young ladies—married women—”
her mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured, in reply,
“very true, my love, very true. exactly so, indeed—quite unheard of—but some ladies say any thi

miss bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner, did not immediately catch her meaning; but, when it burst on her, it could not anger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her.
“ah!—well—to be sure. yes, i see what she means, (turning to mr. knightley,) and i will try to hold my tongue. i must make myself very disagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend.”
“i like your plan,” cried mr. weston. “agreed, agreed. i will do my best. i am making a conundrum. how will a conundrum reckon?”
“low, i am afraid, sir, very low,” answered his son;—“but we shall be indulgent—especially to any one who leads the way.”
“no, no,” said emma, “it will not reckon low. a conundrum of mr. weston’s shall clear him and his next neighbour. come, sir, pray let me hear it.”
“i doubt its being very clever myself,” said mr. weston. “it is too much a matter of fact, but here it is.

understanding and gratification came together. it might be a very indifferent piece of wit, but emma found a great deal to laugh at and enjoy in it—and so did frank and harriet.—it did not seem to touch the rest of the party equally; some looked very stupid about it, and mr. knightley gravely said,
“this explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and mr. weston has done very well for himself; but he must have knocked up every body else. perfection should not have come quite so soon.”
“oh! for myself, i protest i must be excused,” said mrs. elton; “i really cannot attempt—i am not at all fond of the sort of thing. i had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which i was not at all pleased with. i knew who it came from. an abominable puppy!—you know who i mean (nodding to her husband). these kind of things are very well at christmas,

“now, ma’am,” said jane to her aunt, “shall we join mrs. elton?”
“if you please, my dear. with all my heart. i am quite ready. i was ready to have gone with her, but this will do just as well. we shall soon overtake her. there she is—no, that’s somebody else. that’s one of the ladies in the irish car party, not at all like her.—well, i declare—”
they walked off, followed in half a minute by mr. knightley. mr. weston, his son, emma, and harriet, only remained; and the young man’s spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant. even emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others, or sitting almost alone, and quite unattended to, in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her. the appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight; and even the bustle of collecting and prepar

had never been admitted before to be seriously ill. the event acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints.
“poor mrs. churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal: more than any body had ever supposed—and continual pain would try the temper. it was a sad event—a great shock—with all her faults, what would mr. churchill do without her? mr. churchill’s loss would be dreadful indeed. mr. churchill would never get over it.”—even mr. weston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said, “ah! poor woman, who would have thought it!” and resolved, that his mourning should be as handsome as possible; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense, true and steady. how it would affect frank was among the earliest thoughts of both. it was also a very early speculation with emma. the character of mrs. churchill, the grief of her husband—her mind glanced over them both with awe and comp

 was given so little credit for proper feeling, or esteemed so little worthy as a friend: but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good, and of being able to say to herself, that could mr. knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting jane fairfax, could he even have seen into her heart, he would not, on this occasion, have found any thing to reprove.




chapter x

one morning, about ten days after mrs. churchill’s decease, emma was called downstairs to mr. weston, who “could not stay five minutes, and wanted particularly to speak with her.”—he met her at the parlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did, in the natural key of his voice, sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her father,
“can you come to randalls at any time this morning?—do, if it be possible. mrs. weston wants to see you. she must see you.”
“is she unwell?”
“no, no, not at all—only a little agitated. she would have ordered the carriage, and come to you, but she m

 it is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way. but what can be the matter?—is she really not ill?”
“depend upon me—but ask no more questions. you will know it all in time. the most unaccountable business! but hush, hush!”
to guess what all this meant, was impossible even for emma. something really important seemed announced by his looks; but, as her friend was well, she endeavoured not to be uneasy, and settling it with her father, that she would take her walk now, she and mr. weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for randalls.
“now,”—said emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,—“now mr. weston, do let me know what has happened.”
“no, no,”—he gravely replied.—“don’t ask me. i promised my wife to leave it all to her. she will break it to you better than i can. do not be impatient, emma; it will all come out too soon.”
“break it to me,” cried emma, standing still with terror.—“good god!—mr.

“no, indeed you are mistaken.”—
“mr. weston do not trifle with me.—consider how many of my dearest friends are now in brunswick square. which of them is it?—i charge you by all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment.”
“upon my word, emma.”—
“your word!—why not your honour!—why not say upon your honour, that it has nothing to do with any of them? good heavens!—what can be to be broke to me, that does not relate to one of that family?”
“upon my honour,” said he very seriously, “it does not. it is not in the

ts being some money concern—something just come to light, of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family,—something which the late event at richmond had brought forward. her fancy was very active. half a dozen natural children, perhaps—and poor frank cut off!—this, though very undesirable, would be no matter of agony to her. it inspired little more than an animating curiosity.
“who is that gentleman on horseback?” said she, as they proceeded—speaking more to assist mr. weston in keeping his secret, than with any other view.
“i do not know.—one of the otways.—not frank;—it is not frank, i assure you. you will not see him. he is half way to windsor by this time.”
“has your son been with you, then?”
“oh! yes—did not you know?—well, well, never mind.”
for a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more guarded and demure,
“yes, frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did.”
they hurried on, and were speedily at randalls.

“well, my dear,” said he, as they entered the room—“i have brought her, and now i hope you will soon be better. i shall leave you together. there is no use in delay. i shall not be far off, if you want me.”—and emma distinctly heard him add, in a lower tone, before he quitted the room,—“i have been as good as my word. she has not the least idea.”
mrs. weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation, that emma’s uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone, she eagerly said,
“what is it my dear friend? something of a very unpleasant nature, i find, has occurred;—do let me know directly what it is. i have been walking all this way in complete suspense. we both abhor suspense. do not let mine continue longer. it will do you good to speak of your distress, whatever it may be.”

“you are right. it does relate to him, and i will tell you directly;” (resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.) “he has been here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand. it is impossible to express our surprize. he came to speak to his father on a subject,—to announce an attachment—”
she stopped to breathe. emma thought first of herself, and then of harriet.
“more than an attachment, indeed,” resumed mrs. weston; “an engagement—a positive engagement.—what will you say, emma—what will any body say, when it is known that frank churchill and miss fairfax are engaged;—nay, that they have been long engaged!”
emma even jumped with surprize;—and, horror-struck, exclaimed,
“jane fairfax!—good god! you are not serious? you do not mean it?”
“you may well be amazed,” returned mrs. weston, still averting her eyes, and talking on with eagerness, that emma might have time to recover— “you

can at all comprehend it. what!—engaged to her all the winter—before either of them came to highbury?”
“engaged since october,—secretly engaged.—it has hurt me, emma, very much. it has hurt his father equally. some part of his conduct we cannot excuse.”
emma pondered a moment, and then replied, “i will not pretend not to understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power, be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me, as you are apprehensive of.”
mrs. weston looked up, afraid to believe; but emma’s countenance was as steady as her words.
“that you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my present perfect indifference,” she continued, “i will farther tell you, that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance, when i did like him, when i was very much disposed to be attached to him—nay, was attached—and how it came to cease, is perhaps the wonder. fortunately, however, it did cease. i have really for some time p

ast, for at least these three months, cared nothing about him. you may believe me, mrs. weston. this is the simple truth.”
mrs. weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could find utterance, assured her, that this protestation had done her more good than any thing else in the world could do.
“mr. weston will be almost as much relieved as myself,” said she. “on this point we have been wretched. it was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other—and we were persuaded that it was so.— imagine what we have been feeling on your account.”
“i have escaped; and that i should escape, may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself. but this does not acquit him, mrs. weston; and i must say, that i think him greatly to blame. what right had he to come among us with affectio

.”
“there were misunderstandings between them, emma; he said so expressly. he had not time to enter into much explanation. he was here only a quarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay—but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said. the present crisis, indeed, seemed to be brought on by them; and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct.”
“impropriety! oh! mrs. weston—it is too calm a censure. much, much beyond impropriety!—it has sunk him, i cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion. so unlike what a man should be!—none of that upright integrity, that strict adherence to truth and principle, that disdain of trick and littleness, which a man should display in every transaction of his life.”
“nay, dear emma, now i must take his part; for though he has been wrong in this instance, i have known him long enough to answer for his having many, very ma

emma began to listen better.
“i am to hear from him soon,” continued mrs. weston. “he told me at parting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now. let us wait, therefore, for this letter. it may bring many extenuations. it may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood. don’t let us be severe, don’t let us be in a hurry to condemn him. let us have patience. i must love him; and now that i am satisfied on one point, the one material point, i am sincer

 such a league in secret to judge us all!—here have we been, the whole winter and spring, completely duped, fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour, with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round, comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear.—they must take the consequence, if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable!”
“i am quite easy on that head,” replied mrs. weston. “i am very sure that i never said any thing of either to the other, which both might not have heard.”
“you are in luck.—your only blunder was confined to my ear, when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady.”
“true. but as i have always had a thoroughly good opinion of miss fairfax, i never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her; and as to speaking ill of him, there i must have been safe.”
at this moment mr. weston appeared at a little distance from

“much, indeed!” cried emma feelingly. “if a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like jane fairfax’s.—of such, one may almost say, that ‘the world is not their’s, nor the world’s law.’”
she met mr. weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance, exclaiming,
“a very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word! this was a device, i suppose, to sport with my curiosity, and exercise my talent of guessing. but you really frightened me. i thought you had lost half your property, at least. and here, instead of its being a matter of condolence, it turns out to be one of congratulation.—i congratulate you, mr. weston, with all my heart, on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and

in spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous, that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by harriet,

which mrs. weston had just gone through by herself. the intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to her, she was now to be anxiously announcing to another. her heart beat quick on hearing harriet’s footstep and voice; so, she supposed, had poor mrs. weston felt when she was approaching randalls. could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!—but of that, unfortunately, there could be no chance.
“well, miss woodhouse!” cried harriet, coming eagerly into the room—“is not this the oddest news that ever was?”
“what news do you mean?” replied emma, unable to guess, by look or voice, whether harriet could indeed have received any hint.
“about jane fairfax. did you ever hear any thing so strange? oh!—you need not be afr

“what did mr. weston tell you?”—said emma, still perplexed.
“oh! he told me all about it; that jane fairfax and mr. frank churchill are to be married, and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while. how very odd!”
it was, indeed, so odd; harriet’s behaviour was so extremely odd, that emma did not know how to understand it. her character appeared absolutely changed. she seemed to propose shewing no agitation, or disappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery. emma looked at

e topic had better be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again, except in the company of others—she objected only to a tete-a-tete—they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.—harriet submitted, and approved, and was grateful.
this point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear emma’s thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them, sleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours—mrs. weston, who had been calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took hartfield in her way home, almost as much in duty to emma as in pleasure to herself, to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.
mr. weston had accompanied her to mrs. bates’s, and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having then induced miss fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned with much more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction, than a quarter of an h

a little curiosity emma had; and she made the most of it while her friend related. mrs. weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present, to be allowed merely to write to miss fairfax instead, and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed, and mr. churchill could be reconciled to the engagement’s becoming known; as, considering every thing, she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports:—but mr. weston had thought differently; he was extremely anxious to she

ir happiness, so disinterested in every sensation; thought so much of jane; so much of every body, and so little of themselves, that every kindly feeling was at work for them. miss fairfax’s recent illness had offered a fair plea for mrs. weston to invite her to an airing; she had drawn back and declined at first, but, on being pressed had yielded; and, in the course of their drive, mrs. weston had, by gentle encouragement, overcome so much of her embarrassment, as to bring her to converse on the important subject. apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception, and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and mr. weston, must necessarily open the cause; but when these effusions were put by, they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement. mrs. weston was convinced that such conversati

“on the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment of so many months,” continued mrs. weston, “she was energetic. this was one of her expressions. ‘i will not say, that since i entered into the engagement i have not had some happy moments; but i can say, that i have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:’—and the quivering lip, emma, which uttered it, was an attestation that i felt at my heart.”
“poor girl!” said emma. “she thinks herself wrong, then, for having consented to a private engagement?”

“if i did not know her to be happy now,” said emma, seriously, “which, in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience, she must be, i could not bear these thanks;—for, oh! mrs. weston, if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good i have done miss fairfax!—well (checking herself, and trying to be more lively), this is all to be forgotten. you are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars. they shew her to the greatest advantage. i am sure she is very good—i hope she will be very happy. it is fit that the fortune should be on his side, for i think the merit will be all on hers.”
such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by mrs. weston. she thoug

“are you well, my emma?” was mrs. weston’s parting question.

the weather affected mr. woodhouse, and he could only be kept tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter’s side, and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before. it reminded her of their first forlorn tete-a-tete, on the evening of mrs. weston’s wedding-day; but mr. knightley had walked in then, soon after tea, and dissipated every melancholy fancy. alas! such delightful proofs of hartfield’s attraction, as those sort of visits conveyed, might shortly be over. the picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter, had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them, no pleasures had been lost.—but her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction. the prospect before her now,

 was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled—that might not be even partially brightened. if all took place that might take place among the circle of her friends, hartfield must be comparatively deserted; and she left to cheer her father with the spirits only of ruined happiness.
the child to be born at randalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself; and mrs. weston’s heart and time would be occupied by it. they should lose her; and, probably, in great measure, her husband also.—frank churchill would return among them no more; and miss fairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease to belong to highbury. they would be married, and settled either at or near enscombe. all that were good would be withdrawn; and if to these losses, the loss of donwell were to be added, what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach? mr. kn

“oh! the best nature in the world—a wedding.”
after waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more, he replied,
“if you mean miss fairfax and frank churchill, i have heard that already.”
“how is it possible?” cried emma, turning her glowing cheeks towards him; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he might have called at mrs. goddard’s in his way.
“i had a few lines on parish business from mr. weston this morning, and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened.”
emma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little more composure,
“you probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have had your suspicions.—i have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution.—i wish i had attended to it—but—(with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh) i seem to have been doomed to blindness.”

this letter must make its way to emma’s feelings. she was obliged, in spite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do it all the justice that mrs. weston foretold. as soon as she came to her own name, it was irresistible; every line relating to herself was interesting, and almost every line agreeable; and when this charm ceased, the subject could still maintain itself, by the natural return of her former regard for the writer, and the very strong attracti

on which any picture of love must have for her at that moment. she never stopt till she had gone through the whole; and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong, yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed—and he had suffered, and was very sorry—and he was so grateful to mrs. weston, and so much in love with miss fairfax, and she was so happy herself, that there was no being severe; and could he have entered the room, she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever.
she thought so well of the letter, that when mr. knightley came again, she desired him to read it. she was sure of mrs. weston’s wishing it to be communicated; especially to one, who, like mr. knightley, had seen so much to blame in his conduct.
“i shall be very glad to look it over,” said he; “

but that would not do. mr. weston was to call in the evening, and she must return it by him.
“i would rather be talking to you,” he replied; “but as it seems a matter of justice, it shall be done.”
he began—stopping, however, almost directly to say, “had i been offered the sight of one of this gentleman’s letters to his mother-in-law a few months ago, emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference.”
he proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then, with a smile, observed, “humph! a fine c

ds, “to speak my opinion aloud as i read. by doing it, i shall feel that i am near you. it will not be so great a loss of time: but if you dislike it—”
“not at all. i should wish it.”
mr. knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity.
“he trifles here,” said he, “as to the temptation. he knows he is wrong, and has nothing rational to urge.—bad.—he ought not to have formed the engagement.—‘his father’s disposition:’—he is unjust, however, to his father. mr. weston’s sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions; but mr. weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it.—very true; he did not come till miss fairfax was here.”
“and i have not forgotten,” said emma, “how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would. you pass it over very handsomely—but you were perfectly right.”
“i was not quite impartial in my judgment, emma:—but yet, i think—had you not been in the case—i

she would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which harriet had occupied. there was a communication before her, one which she only could be competent to make—the confession of her engagement to her father; but she would have nothing to do with it at present.—she had resolved to defer the disclosure till mrs. weston were safe and well. no additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved—and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time.—a fortnight, at least, of leisure and peace of mind, to crown every warmer, but more agitating, delight, should be hers.
she soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on miss fairfax.—she ought to go—and she was longing to see her; the resembl

and again, on emma’s merely turning her head to look at mrs. bates’s knitting, she added, in a half whisper,
“i mentioned no names, you will observe.—oh! no; cautious as a minister of state. i managed it extremely well.”
emma could not doubt. it was a palpable display, repeated on every possible occasion. when they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and mrs. weston, she found herself abruptly addressed with,
“do not you think, miss woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered?—do not you think her cure does perry the highest credit?—(here was a side-glance of great meaning at jane.) upon my word, perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!—oh! if you had seen her, as i did, when she was at the worst!”—and when mrs. bates was saying something to emma, whispered farther, “we do not say a word of any assistance that per

miss bates looked about her, so happily—!
“he promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from knightley; but he and knightley are shut up together in deep consultation.—mr. e. is knightley’s right hand.”
emma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, “is mr. elton gone on foot to donwell?—he will have a hot walk.”
“oh! no, it is a meeting at the crown, a regular meeting. weston and cole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only of those who lead.—i fancy mr. e. and knightley have every thing their own way.”
“have not you mistaken the day?” said emma. “i am almost certain that the meeting at the crown is not till to-morrow.—mr. knightley was at hartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for saturday.”
“oh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day,” was the abrupt answer, which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on mrs. elton’s side.—“i do be

“thank you, thank you.—this is just what i wanted to be assured of.—oh! if you knew how much i love every thing that is decided and open!—good-bye, good-bye.”




chapter xvii

mrs. weston’s friends were all made happy by her safety; and if the satisfaction of her well-doing could be increased to emma, it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl. she had been decided in wishing for a miss weston. she would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her, hereafter, with either of isabella’s sons; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best. it would be a great comfort to mr. weston, as he grew older—and even m

“she has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me,” she continued—“like la baronne d’almane on la comtesse d’ostalis, in madame de genlis’ adelaide and theodore, and we shall now see her own little adelaide educated on a more perfect plan.”
“that is,” replied mr. knightley, “she will indu

“i am sure you were of use to me,” cried emma. “i was very often influenced rightly by you—oftener than i would own at the time. i am very sure you did me good. and if poor little anna weston is to be spoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me, except falling in love with her when she is thirteen.”
“how often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one of your saucy looks—‘mr. knightley, i am going to do so-and-so; papa says i may, or i have miss taylor’s leave’—something which, you knew, i did not approve. in such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one.”

the time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other persons’ reception of it tried. as soon as mrs. weston was sufficiently recovered to admit mr. woodhouse’s visits, emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause, resolved first to announce it at home, and then at randalls.—but how to break it to her father at last!—she had bound herself to do it, in such an hour of mr. knightley’s absence, or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her, and she must have put it off; but mr. knightley was to come at such a time, and follow up the beginning sh

ppear to think it a misfortune.—with all the spirits she could command, she prepared him first for something strange, and then, in a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation could be obtained—which, she trusted, would be attended with no difficulty, since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all—she and mr. knightley meant to marry; by which means hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person’s company whom she knew he loved, next to his daughters and mrs. weston, best in the world.
poor man!—it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it. she was reminded, more than once, of having always said she would never marry, and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single; and told of poor isabella, and poor miss taylor.—but it would not do. emma hung about him affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that he must not class her with isabella and mrs. weston, whose marriage

as.—why could not they go on as they had done?
mr. woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome, the idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.—to emma’s entreaties and assurances succeeded mr. knightley’s, whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome; and he was soon used to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.—they had all the assistance which isabella could give, by letters of the strongest approbation; and mrs. weston was ready, on the first meeting, to consider the subject in the most serviceable light—first, as a settled, and, secondly, as a good one—well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to mr. woodhouse’s mind.—it was agreed upon, as what was to be; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it, he began to think that some time or other—in another year or tw

mrs. weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event.—she had been extremely surprized, never more so, than when emma first opened the affair to her; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost.—she had such a regard for mr. knightley, as to think he deserved even her dearest emma; and it was in every respect so proper, suitable, and unexceptionable a connexion, and in one respect, one point of th

hed it long ago.—how very few of those men in a rank of life to address emma would have renounced their own home for hartfield! and who but mr. knightley could know and bear with mr. woodhouse, so as to make such an arrangement desirable!—the difficulty of disposing of poor mr. woodhouse had been always felt in her husband’s plans and her own, for a marriage between frank and emma. how to settle the claims of enscombe and hartfield had been a continual impediment—less acknowledged by mr. weston than by herself—but even he had never been able to finish the subject better than by saying—“those matters will take care of themselves; the young people will find a way.” but here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future. it was all right, all open, all equal. no sacrifice on any side worth the name. it was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself, and without one real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.

the news was universally a surprize wherever it spread; and mr. weston had his five minutes share of it; but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind.—he saw the advantages of the match, and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing; and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it.

in the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father; not always listening, but always agreeing to what he said; and, whether in speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to randalls every day, or poor mrs. weston would be disappointed.
they arrived.—mrs. weston was alone in the drawing-room:—but hardly had they been told of the baby, and mr. woodhouse received the thanks for coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse was caught through the blind, of two figures passing near the window.

“i have to thank you, miss woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving message in one of mrs. weston’s letters. i hope time has not made you less willing to pardon. i hope you do not retract what you then said.”
“no, indeed,” cried emma, most happy to begin, “not in the least. i am particularly glad to see

he thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.
“is not she looking well?” said he, turning his eyes towards jane. “better than she ever used to do?—you see how my father and mrs. weston doat upon her.”
but his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes, after mentioning the expected return of the campbells, he named the name of dixon.—emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing.
“i can never think of it,” she cried, “without extreme shame.”
“the shame,” he answered, “is all mine, or ought to be. but is it possible that you had no suspicion?—i mean of late. early, i know, you had none.”
