d fearfully anticipated.
as she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day, a note was brought from mrs. goddard, requesting, in most respectful terms, to be allowed to bring miss smith with her; a most welcome request: for miss smith was a girl of seventeen, whom emma knew very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on account of her beauty. a very gracious invitation was returned, and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.
harriet smith was the natural daughter of somebody. somebody had placed her, several years back, at mrs. goddard’s school, and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour-boarder. this was all that was generally known of her history. she had no visible friends but what had been acquired at highbury, and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her.
she was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to

chapter iv

harriet smith’s intimacy at hartfield was soon a settled thing. quick and decided in her ways, emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging, and telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased, so did their satisfaction in each other. as a walking companion, emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her. in that respect mrs. weston’s loss had been important. her father never went beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk, or his

short, as the year varied; and since mrs. weston’s marriage her exercise had been too much confined. she had ventured once alone to randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a harriet smith, therefore, one whom she could summon at any time to a walk, would be a valuable addition to her privileges. but in every respect, as she saw more of her, she approved her, and was confirmed in all her kind designs.
harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, grateful disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to. her early attachment to herself was very amiable; and her inclination for good company, and power of apprec

iating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no want of taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected. altogether she was quite convinced of harriet smith’s being exactly the young friend she wanted—exactly the something which her home required. such a friend as mrs. weston was out of the question. two such could never be granted. two such she did not want. it was quite a different sort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. mrs. weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem. harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful. for mrs. weston there was nothing to be done; for harriet every thing

woman not fastidious might like. he was reckoned very handsome; his person much admired in general, though not by her, there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with:—but the girl who could be gratified by a robert martin’s riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by mr. elton’s admiration.




chapter v

“i do not know what your opinion may be, mrs. weston,” said mr. knightley, “of this great intimacy between emma and harriet smith, but i think it a bad thing.”
“a bad thing! do you really think it a bad thing?—why so?”
“i think they will neither of them do the other any good.”
“you surprize me! emma must do harriet good: and by supplying her with a new object of interest, harriet may be said to do emma good. i have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. how very differently we feel!—not think they will do each other any good! this will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about

on the subject. we were speaking of it only yesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for emma, that there should be such a girl in highbury for her to associate with. mr. knightley, i shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case. you are so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value of a companion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex, after being used to it all her life. i can imagine your objection to harriet smith. she is not the superior young woman which emma’s friend ought to be. but on the other hand, as emma wants to see her better informed, it will be an inducement to her to read more herself. they will read together. she means it, i know.”
“emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old. i have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through—and very good lists they were—very well chosen, and very neatly

etimes alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. the list she drew up when only fourteen—i remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit, that i preserved it some time; and i dare say she may have made out a very good list now. but i have done with expecting any course of steady reading from emma. she will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding. where miss taylor failed to stimulate, i may safely affirm that harriet smith will do nothing.—you never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished.—you know you could not.”
“i dare say,” replied mrs. weston, smiling, “that i thought so then;—but since we have parted, i can never remember emma’s omitting to do any thing i wished.”
“there is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as that,”—said mr. knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done. “but i,” he soon added, “who have had no such charm thrown over my sen

 with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne. we will not despair, however. weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort, or his son may plague him.”
“i hope not that.—it is not likely. no, mr. knightley, do not foretell vexation from that quarter.”
“not i, indeed. i only name possibilities. i do not pretend to emma’s genius for foretelling and guessing. i hope, with all my heart, the young man may be a weston in merit, and a churchill in fortune.—but harriet smith—i have not half done about harriet smith. i think her the very worst sort of companion that emma could possibly have. she knows nothing herself, and looks upon emma as knowing every thing. she is a flatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned. her ignorance is hourly flattery. how can emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself, while harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority? and as for harriet, i will venture to say that she cannot gain by the acquainta

h;’ now, emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health. she is loveliness itself. mr. knightley, is not she?”
“i have not a fault to find with her person,” he replied. “i think her all you describe. i love to look at her; and i will add this praise, that i do not think her personally vain. considering how very handsome she is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies another way. mrs. weston, i am not to be talked out of my dislike of harriet smith, or my dread of its doing them both harm.”
“and i, mr. knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm. with all dear emma’s little faults, she is an excellent creature. where shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder sister, or a truer friend? no, no; she has qualities which may be trusted; she will never lead any one really wrong; she will make no lasting blunder; where emma errs once, she is in the right a hundred times.”

“i know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind; but excuse me, mr. knightley, if i take the liberty (i consider myself, you know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that emma’s mother might have had) the liberty of hinting that i do not think any possible good can arise from harriet smith’s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you. pray excuse me; but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy, it cannot be expected that emma, accountable to nobody but her father, who perfectly approves the acquaintance, should put an end to it, so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself. it has been so many years my province to give advice, that you cannot be surprized, mr. knightley, at this little remains of office.”

“indeed! how so? of what sort?”
“a very serious sort, i assure you;” still smiling.
“very serious! i can think of but one thing—who is in love with her? who makes you their confidant?”
emma was more than half in hopes of mr. elton’s having dropt a hint. mr. knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew mr. elton looked up to him.
“i have reason to think,” he replied, “that harriet smith will soon have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable quarter:—robert martin is the man. her visit to abbey-mill, this summer, seems to have done his business. he is desperately in love and means to marry her.”
“he is very obliging,” said emma; “but is he sure that harriet means to marry him?”
“well, well, means to make her an offer then. will that do? he came to the abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it. he knows i have a thorough regard for him

 and mr. knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as he stood up, in tall indignation, and said,
“then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believed her. what is the foolish girl about?”
“oh! to be sure,” cried emma, “it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. a man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her.”
“nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. but what is the meaning of this? harriet smith refuse robert martin? madness, if it is so; but i hope you are mistaken.”
“i saw her answer!—nothing could be clearer.”
“you saw her answer!—you wrote her answer too. emma, this is your doing. you persuaded her to refuse him.”
“and if i did, (which, however, i am far from allowing) i should not feel that i had done wrong. mr. martin is a very respectable young man, but i cannot admit him to be harriet’s equal; and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to addr

ess her. by your account, he does seem to have had some scruples. it is a pity that they were ever got over.”
“not harriet’s equal!” exclaimed mr. knightley loudly and warmly; and with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, “no, he is not her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation. emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. what are harriet smith’s claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any connexion higher than robert martin? she is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and certainly no respectable relations. she is known only as parlour-boarder at a common school. she is not a sensible girl, nor a girl of any information. she has been taught nothing useful, and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself. at her age she can have no experience, and with her

 to shift as she can;—to move, in short, in mrs. goddard’s line, to have mrs. goddard’s acquaintance. her friends evidently thought this good enough for her; and it was good enough. she desired nothing better herself. till you chose to turn her into a friend, her mind had no distaste for her own set, nor any ambition beyond it. she was as happy as possible with the martins in the summer. she had no sense of superiority then. if she has it now, you have given it. you have been no friend to harriet smith, emma. robert martin would never have proceeded so far, if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him. i know him well. he has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion. and as to conceit, he is the farthest from it of any man i know. depend upon it he had encouragement.”
it was most convenient to emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again.
“you are a very warm frien

 always thought it a very foolish intimacy,” said mr. knightley presently, “though i have kept my thoughts to myself; but i now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for harriet. you will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what she has a claim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her reach will be good enough for her. vanity working on a weak head, produces every sort of mischief. nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high. miss harriet smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast, though she is a very pretty girl. men of sense, whatever you may chuse to say, do not want silly wives. men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity—and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in, when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed. let her marry robert martin, and she is safe, respectable, and happy for ever; but if you encourage

 her to expect to marry greatly, and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune, she may be a parlour-boarder at mrs. goddard’s all the rest of her life—or, at least, (for harriet smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other,) till she grow desperate, and is glad to catch at the old writing-master’s son.”
“we think so very differently on this point, mr. knightley, that there can be no use in canvassing it. we shall only be making each other more angry. but as to my letting her marry robert martin, it is impossible; she has refused him, and so decidedly, i think, as must prevent any second application. she must abide by the evil of having refused him, whatever it may

 altogether, having seen nobody better (that must have been his great assistant) she might not, while she was at abbey-mill, find him disagreeable. but the case is altered now. she knows now what gentlemen are; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with harriet.”
“nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!” cried mr. knightley.—“robert martin’s manners have sense, sincerity, and good-humour to recommend them; and his mind has more true gentility than harriet smith could understand.”
emma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone. she did not repent what she had done; she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general, which made her dislike having it so loudly against her; and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state, was ver

mr. woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,
“our little friend harriet smith, however, is just such another pretty kind of young person. you will like harriet. emma could not have a better companion than harriet.”
“i am most happy to hear it—but only jane fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior!—and exactly emma’s age.”
this topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of similar moment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation. the gruel came and supplied a great dea

“i do own myself to have been completely mistaken in mr. elton. there is a littleness about him which you discovered, and which i did not: and i was fully convinced of his being in love with harriet. it was through a series of strange blunders!”
“and, in return for your acknowledging so much, i will do you the justice to say, that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself.—harriet smith has some first-rate qualities, which mrs. elton is totally without. an unpretending, single-minded, artless girl—infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as mrs. elton. i found harriet more conversable than i expected.”
emma was extremely gratified.—they were interrupted by the bustle of mr. weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.

g and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense, true and steady. how it would affect frank was among the earliest thoughts of both. it was also a very early speculation with emma. the character of mrs. churchill, the grief of her husband—her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion—and then rested with lightened feelings on how frank might be affected by the event, how benefited, how freed. she saw in a moment all the possible good. now, an attachment to harriet smith would have nothing to encounter. mr. churchill, independent of his wife, was feared by nobody; an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew. all that remained to be wished was, that the nephew should form the attachment, as, with all her goodwill in the cause, emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed.
harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great self-command. what ever she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayed nothing. emma was gratified,

h constituted the real misery of the business to her. frank churchill had behaved very ill by herself—very ill in many ways,—but it was not so much his behaviour as her own, which made her so angry with him. it was the scrape which he had drawn her into on harriet’s account, that gave the deepest hue to his offence.—poor harriet! to be a second time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery. mr. knightley had spoken prophetically, when he once said, “emma, you have been no friend to harriet smith.”—she was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice.—it was true that she had not to charge herself, in this instance as in the former, with being the sole and original author of the mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered harriet’s imagination; for harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of frank churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she migh

mr. knightley and harriet smith!—it was a union to distance every wonder of the kind.—the attachment of frank churchill and jane fairfax became commonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison, exciting no surprize, presenting no disparity, affording nothing to be said or thought.—mr. knightley and harriet smith!—such an elevation on her side! such a debasement on his! it was horrible to emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion, to foresee the smiles, the sneers, the merriment it would prompt at his e

emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her, to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies—her wilful intimacy with harriet smith; but it was too tender a subject.—she could not enter on it.—harriet was very seldom mentioned between them. this, on his side, might merely proceed from her not being thought of; but emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy, and a suspicion, from some appearances, that their friendship were declining. she was aware herself, that, parting under any other circumstances, they certainly should have corresponded more, and that her intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost

“i am afraid,” said he, composing his features, “i am very much afraid, my dear emma, that you will not smile when you hear it.”
“indeed! but why so?—i can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you, should not please and amuse me too.”
“there is one subject,” he replied, “i hope but one, on which we do not think alike.” he paused a moment, again smiling, with his eyes fixed on her face. “does nothing occur to you?—do not you recollect?—harriet smith.”
her cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of something, though she knew not what.
“have you heard from her yourself this morning?” cried he. “you have, i believe, and know the whole.”
“no, i have not; i know nothing; pray tell me.”
“you are prepared for the worst, i see—and very bad it is. harriet smith marries robert martin.”
emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared—and her eyes, in eager gaze, said, “no, this is impossible!” but her lips

“you like it, my emma, as little as i feared.—i wish our opinions were the same. but in time they will. time, you may be sure, will make one or the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile, we need not talk much on the subject.”
“you mistake me, you quite mistake me,” she replied, exerting herself. “it is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy, but i cannot believe it. it seems an impossibility!—you cannot mean to say, that harriet smith has accepted robert martin. you cannot mean that he has even proposed to her again—yet. you only mean, that he intends it.”
“i mean that he has done it,” answered mr. knightley, with smiling but determined decision, “and been accepted.”

and, fortunately, what ought to be, and must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual, natural manner.
before the end of september, emma attended harriet to church, and saw her hand bestowed on robert martin with so complete a satisfaction, as no remembrances, even connected with mr. elton as he stood before them, could impair.—perhaps, indeed, at that time she scarcely saw mr. elton, but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself.—robert martin and harriet smith, the latest couple engaged of the three, were the first to be married.
jane fairfax had already quitted highbury, and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the campbells.—the mr. churchills were also in town; and they were only waiting for november.
the intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared, by emma and mr. knightley.—they had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while john and isabella were still at hartfield, to allow them the fortni
