i pulled the fork out of the dog and lifted him into my arms and hugged him. he was leaking blood from 
the fork holes. 
 
i  like  dogs.  you  always  know  what  a  dog  is  thinking.  it  has  four  moods.  happy,  sad,  cross  and 
concentrating. also, dogs are faithful and they do not tell lies because they cannot talk. 
 
i  had  been  hugging  the  dog  for  4  minutes  when  i  heard  screaming.  i  looked  up  and  saw  mrs.  shears 
running toward me from the patio. she was wearing pajamas and a housecoat. her toenails were painted 
bright pink and she had no shoes on. 
 
she was shouting, "what in fuck's name have you done to my dog?" 
 
i do not like people shouting at me. it makes me scared that they are going to hit me or touch me and i do 
not know what is going to happen. 
 
"let go of the dog," she shouted. "let go of the fucking dog for christ's sake." 
 
i put the dog down on the lawn and moved back 2 meters.

then the police arrived. i like the police. they have uniforms and numbers and you know what they are 
meant to be doing. there was a policewoman and a policeman. the policewoman had a little hole in her 
tights on her left ankle and a red scratch in the middle of the hole. the policeman had a big orange leaf 
stuck to the bottom of his shoe which was poking out from one side. 
 
the policewoman put her arms round mrs. shears and led her back toward the house. 
 
i lifted my head off the grass. 
 
the  policeman  squatted  down  beside  me  and  said,  "would  you  like  to  tell  me  what's  going  on  here, 
young man?" 
 
i sat up and said, "the dog is dead." 
 
"i'd got that far," he said. 
 
i said, "i think someone killed the dog." 
 
"how old are you?" he asked. 
 
i replied, "i am 15 years and 3 months and 2 days." 
 
"and what, precisely, were you doing in the garden?" he asked. 
 
"i was holding the dog," i

ry.  it  would  be  difficult  because  the  only  things  i  had 
were my clothes and my shoes, which had no laces in them. 
 
i decided that my best plan would be to wait for a really sunny day and then use my glasses to focus the 
sunlight  on  a  piece  of  my  clothing  and  start  a  fire.  i  would  then  make  my  escape  when  they  saw  the 
smoke and took me out of the cell. and if they didn't notice i would be able to wee on the clothes and put 
them out. 

 
i wondered whether mrs. shears had told the police that i had killed wellington and whether, when the 
police  found  out  that  she  had  lied,  she  would  go  to  prison.  because  telling  lies  about  people  is  called 
slander.

bit in their blood vessels, like mrs. 
hardisty, who lived at number 72 in our street, who had a weak bit in the blood vessels in her neck and 
died just because she turned her head round to reverse her car into a parking space. 
 
on the other hand, it could have been an embolism, because your blood clots much more easily when you 
are lying down for a long time, like when you are in hospital. 

 
father said, "i'm sorry, christopher, i'm really sorry." 
 
but it wasn't his fault. 
 
then mrs. shears came over and cooked supper for us. and she was wearing sandals and jeans and a t-
shirt which had the words windsurf and corfu and a picture of a windsurfer on it. 
 
and father was sitting down and she stood next to him and held his head against her bosoms and said, 
"come on, ed. we're going to get you through this." 
 
and then she made us spaghetti and tomato sauce. 
 
and after dinner she played scrabble with me and i beat her 247 points to 134.

aned because there was no blood on the spikes. i could see some other tools as well, a spade 
and a rake and one of those long clippers people use for cutting branches which are too high to reach. and 
they  all  had  the  same  green  plastic  handles  like  the  fork.  this  meant  that  the  fork  belonged  to  mrs. 
shears. either that or it was a red herring, which is a clue which makes you come to a wrong conclusion 
or something which looks like a clue but isn't. 
 
i  wondered  if  mrs.  shears  had  killed  wellington  herself.  but  if  she  had  killed  wellington  herself,  why 
had she come out of the house shouting, "what in fuck's name have you done to my dog?" 
 
i  thought  that  mrs.  shears  probably  didn't  kill  wellington.  but  whoever  had  killed  him  had  probably 
killed him with mrs. shears's fork. and the shed was locked. this meant that it was someone who had the 
key to mrs. shears's shed, or that she had left it unlocked, or that she had left her fork lying ar

i heard a noise and turned round and saw mrs. shears standing on the lawn looking at me. 
 
i said, "i came to see if the fork was in the shed." 
 
and she said, "if you don't go now i will call the police again." 
 
so i went home. 
 
when i got home i said hello to father and went upstairs and fed toby, my rat, and felt happy because i 
was being a detective and finding things out.

i said, "do you know who killed wellington?" 

i did not look at his face. i do not like looking at people's faces, especially if they are strangers. he did 
not say anything for a few seconds. 

then he said, "who are you?" 

i said, "i'm christopher boone from number 36 and i know you. you're mr. thompson." 

he said, "i'm mr. thompson's brother." 

i said, "do you know who killed wellington?" 

he said, "who the fuck is wellington?" 

i said, "mrs. shears's dog. mrs. shears is from number 41." 

he said, "someone killed her dog?" 

i said, "with a fork." 

he said, "jesus christ." 

i said, "a garden fork," in case he thought i meant a fork you eat your food with. then i said, "do you 
know who killed him?" 

he said, "i haven't a bloody clue." 

i said, "did you see anything suspicious on thursday evening?" 

he said, "look, son, do you really think you should be going around asking questions like this?"

new who killed wellington. she knew who wellington was so i 
didn't have to explain, and she had heard about him being killed. 
 
i asked if she had seen anything suspicious on thursday evening which might be a clue. 
 
she said, "like what?" 
 
and i said, "like strangers. or like the sound of people arguing." 
 
but she said she hadn't. 
 
and  then  i  decided  to  do  what  is  called  trying  a  different  tack,  and  i  asked  her  whether  she  knew  of 
anyone who might want to make mrs. shears sad. 
 
and she said, "perhaps you should be talking to your father about this." 
 
and i explained that i couldn't ask my father because the investigation was a secret because he had told 
me to stay out of other people's business. 
 
she said, "well, maybe he has a point, christopher." 
 
and i said, "so, you don't know anything which might be a clue." 
 
and she said, "no," and then she said, "you be careful, young man." 
 
i  said  that  i  would  be  careful  and  then  i  said  thank  you

bout 
getting orange squash and battenberg cake. and i thought she might be ringing the police and then i'd get 
into much more serious trouble because of the caution. 
 
so i walked away. 
 
and as i was crossing the street i had a stroke of inspiration about who might have killed wellington. i 
was imagining a chain of reasoning inside my head which was like this 

1. why would you kill a dog? 
   a) because you hated the dog. 
   b) because you were mad. 
   c) because you wanted to make mrs. shears upset. 
2. i didn't know anyone who hated wellington, so if it was (a) it was probably a stranger. 
3. i didn't know any mad people, so if it was (b) it was also probably a stranger. 
4. most murders are committed by someone who is known to the victim. in fact, you are most likely 
to  be  murdered  by  a  member  of  your  own  family  on  christmas  day.  this  is  a  fact.  wellington  was 
therefore most likely to have been killed by someone known to him. 

5. if it was (c) i only knew one p
 
 ___________________________
 
erson who didn't like mrs. shears, and that was mr. shears, who 

knew wellington very well indeed. 
 
 
this meant that mr. shears was my prime suspect. 
 
mr.  shears  used  to  be  married  to  mrs.  shears  and  they  lived  together  until  two  years  ago.  then  mr. 
shears  left  and  didn't  come  back.  this  was  why  mrs.  shears  came  over  and  did  lots  of  cooking  for  us 
after mother died, because she didn't have to cook for mr. shears anymore and she didn't have to stay at 
home and be his wife. and also father said that she needed company and didn't want to be on her own. 
 
and sometimes mrs. shears stayed overnight at our house and i liked it when she did because she made 
things tidy and she arranged the jars and pans and tins in order of their height on the shelves in the kitchen 
and she always made their labels face outward and she put the knives and forks and spoons in the correct 
compartments  in  the  cutlery  draw

er.  but  she  smoked  cigarettes  and  she  said  lots  of  things  i  didn't 
understand, e.g., "i'm going to hit the hay," and "it's brass monkeys out there," and "let's rustle up some 
tucker." and i didn't like when she said things like that because i didn't know what she meant. 
 
and i don't know why mr. shears left mrs. shears because nobody told me. but when you get married it 
is because you want to live together and have children,  and if you get  married  in  a church you have  to 
promise that you will stay together until death do us part. and if you don't want to live together you have 
to get divorced and this is because one of you has done sex with somebody else or because you are having 
arguments  and  you  hate  each  other  and  you  don't  want  to  live  in  the  same  house  anymore  and  have 
children

. and mr. shears didn't want to live in the same house as mrs. shears anymore so he probably 
hated her and he might have come back and killed her dog to make her sad.  
 
i decided to try and find out more about mr. shears.

then father asked, "what the hell were you doing poking round her garden?" 
 
i said, "i was doing detective work trying to find out who killed wellington." 
 
father replied, "how many times do i have to tell you, christopher?" 
 
the baked beans and the broccoli and the ham were cold but i didn't mind this. i eat very slowly so my 
food is nearly always cold. 
 
father said, "i told you to keep your nose out of other people's business." 
 
i said, "i think mr. shears probably killed wellington." 
 
father didn't say anything. 
 
i  said,  "he  is  my  prime  suspect.  because  i  think  someone  might  have  killed  wellington  to  make  mrs. 
shears sad. and a murder is usually committed by someone known --" 
 
father banged the table with his fist really hard so that the plates and his knife and fork jumped around 
and  my  ham  jumped  sideways  so  that  it  touched  the  broccoli,  so  i  couldn't  eat  the  ham  or  the  broccoli 
anymore.

i asked, "why not?"

father put his head in his hands and said, "jesus wept." 

 
i  could  see  that  father  was  angry with  me,  so  i said,  "i know you  told  me  not  to  get  involved  in  other 
people's business but mrs. shears is a friend of ours." 
 
and father said, "well, she's not a friend anymore." 
 
and i asked, "why not?" 
 
and father said, "ok, christopher. i am going to say this for the last and final time. i will not tell you 
again. look at  me when i'm talking to you, for god's sake. look at  me. you are not to go asking mrs.

person 
who  killed  wellington  could  be  living  somewhere  nearby  and  i  might  meet  him  when  i  went  out  for  a 
walk  at  night.  and  this  was  possible  because  a  murder  was  usually  committed  by  a  person  who  was 
known to the victim. 
 
then i said, "father said i was never to mention mr. shears's name in our house again and that he was an 
evil man and maybe that meant he was the person who killed wellington." 
 
and she said, "perhaps your father just doesn't like mr. shears very much." 
 
and i asked, "why?" 
 
and she said, "i don't know, christopher. i don't know because i don't know anything about mr. shears." 
 
i said, "mr. shears used to be married to mrs. shears and he left her, like in a divorce. but i don't know if 
they were actually divorced." 
 
and siobhan said, "well, mrs. shears is a friend of yours, isn't she. a friend of you and your father. so 
perhaps your father doesn't like mr. shears because he left mrs. shears. because he did something bad to

someone who is a friend." 
 
and i said, "but father says mrs. shears isn't a friend of ours anymore." 
 
and siobhan said, "i'm sorry, christopher. i wish i could answer all these questions, but i simply don't 
know." 
 
then the bell went for the end of school. 
 
the next day i saw 4 yellow cars in a row on the way to school, which made it a black day, so i didn't 
eat anything at lunch and i sat in the corner of the room all day and read my a-level maths course book. 
and the next day, too, i saw 4 yellow cars in a row on the way to school, which made it anoth

then she untied ivor's lead from the drainpipe. 
 
i wasn't going to say anything because i didn't want to get into trouble. 
 
then  i  thought  that  this  was  a  super  good  day  and  something  special  hadn't  happened  yet,  so  it  was 
possible that talking to mrs. alexander was the special thing that was going to happen. and i thought that 
she  might  tell  me  something  about  wellington  or  about  mr.  shears  without  me  asking  her,  so  that 
wouldn't be breaking my promise. 
 
so i said, "and i like maths and looking after toby. and also i like outer space and i like being on my 
own." 
 
and she said, "i bet you're very good at maths, aren't you." 
 
and i said, "i am. i'm going to do my a-level maths next month. and i'm going to get an a grade." 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "really? a-level maths?" 
 
i replied, "yes. i don't tell lies." 
 
and she said, "i apologize. i didn't mean to suggest t

her. my favorite color is red. and metal color." 
 
then ivor did a poo and mrs. alexander picked it up with her hand inside a little plastic bag and then she 
turned the plastic bag inside out and tied a knot in the top so that the poo was all sealed up and she didn't 
touch the poo with her hands. 
 
and then i did some reasoning. i reasoned that father had only made me do a promise about five things, 
which were 
 

1.  not to mention mr. shears's name in our house  
2.  not to go asking mrs. shears about who killed that bloody dog  
3.  not to go asking anyone about who killed that bloody dog  
4.  not to go trespassing in other people's gardens  
5.  to stop this ridiculous bloody detective game  

 

and asking about mr. shears wasn't any of these things.   
 
and if you are a detective you have to take risks, and this was a super good day, which meant it was a 
good day for taking risks, so i said, "do you know mr. shears?" which was like chatting. 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "not real

ly, no. i mean, i knew him well enough to say hello and talk to a little 
in the street, but i didn't know much about him. i think he worked in a bank. the national westminster. 
in town." 
 
and  i  said,  "father  says  that  he  is  an  evil  man.  do  you  know  why  he  said  that?  is  mr.  shears  an  evil 
man?" 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "why are you asking me about mr. shears, christopher?" 
 
i didn't say anything because i didn't want to be investigating wellington's murder and that was the reason 
i was asking about mr. shears. 
 
but mrs. alexander said, "is this about wellington?" 
 
and i nodded because that didn't count as being a detective. 
 
mrs. alexander didn't say anything. she walked to the little red box on a pole next to the gate to the park 
and she put ivor's poo in

sked, "why not?" 
 
and  she  said,  "because."  then  she  stopped  and  decided  to  start  saying  a  different  sentence.  "because 
maybe your father is right and you shouldn't go around asking questions about this." 
 
and i asked, "why?" 
 
and she said, "because obviously he is going to find it quite upsetting." 
 
and i said, "why is he going to find it upsetting?" 
 
then she sucked in another big breath and said, "because. . . because i think you know why your father 
doesn't like mr. shears very much." 
 
then i asked, "did mr. shears kill mother?" 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "kill her?" 
 
and i said, "yes. did he kill mother?" 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "no. no. of course he didn't kill your mother." 
 
and i said, "but did he give her stress so that she died of a heart attack?" 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "i honestly don't know what you're talking about, christopher." 
 
and i said, "or did he hurt her so that she had to go into hospital?" 

 
and mrs. alexander said, "did she
 
 ___________________________
 
 have to go into hospital?" 
 
and i said, "yes. and it wasn't very serious at first, but she had a heart attack when she was in hospital." 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "oh my goodness." 
 
i said, "and she died." 
 
and mrs. alexander said "oh my goodness" again, and then she said, "oh, christopher, i am so, so sorry. 
i never realized." 
 
then  i  asked  her,  "why  did  you  say  'i  think  you  know  why  your  father  doesn't  like  mr.  shears  very 
much'?" 
 
mrs. alexander put her hand over her  mouth and said, "oh dear, dear, dear." but she didn't answer my 
question. 
 
so i asked her the same question again, because in a murder mystery novel when someone doesn't want to 
answer a question it is because they are trying to keep a secret or trying to stop someone from getting into 
trouble, which means that the answers to those questions are the most important answers of all, and that is 
why the detective has to put that person un

meant. and you might ask your father. and i don't want you to do that because i don't want you to upset 
him. so i'm going to explain why i said what i said. but before i do that you have to promise not to tell 
anyone i said this to you." 
 
i asked, "why?" 
 

and she said, "christopher, please, just trust me." 
 
and i said, "i promise." because if mrs. alexander told  me who killed wellington, or she told me that 
mr. shears had really killed mother, i could still go to the police and tell them because you are allowed to 
break a promise if someone has committed a crime and you know about it. 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "your mother, before she died, was very good friends with mr. shears." 
 
and i said, "i know." 
 
and she said, "no, christopher. i'm not sure that you do. i mean that they were very good friends. very, 
very good friends." 
 
i thought about this for a while and said, "do you mean that they were do

and mrs. alexander said, "yes, christopher. that is what i mean." 
 
then she didn't say anything for about 30 seconds. then she said, "i'm sorry, christopher. i really didn't 
mean to say anything that was going to upset you. but i wanted to explain. why i said what i said. you 
see, i thought you knew. that's why your father thinks that mr. shears is an evil man. and that will be 
why he doesn't want you going around talking to people about mr. shears. because that will bring back 
bad memories." 
 
and  i  said,  "was  that  why  mr.  shears  left  mrs.  shears,  because  he  was  doing  sex  with  someone  else 
when he was married to mrs. shears?" 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "yes, i expect so." 
 
then she said, "i'm sorry, christopher. i really am." 
 
and i said, "i think i should go now." 
 
and she said, "are you ok, christopher?"

about this?" 
 
and i replied, "no." 
 
and she said, "are you going to tell your father about this?" 
 
and i replied, "no." 
 
and she said, "good. i think that's a good idea, christopher." and then she said, "did it make you sad to 
find this out?" 
 
and i asked, "find what out?" 
 
and she said, "did it make you upset to find out that your mother and mr. shears had an affair?" 
 
and i said, "no." 
 
and she said, "are you telling the truth, christopher?" 
 
and then i said, "i always tell the truth." 
 
and she said, "i know you do, christopher. but sometimes we get sad about things and we don't like to 
tell other people that we are sad about them. we like to keep it a secret. or sometimes we are sad but we 
don't really know we are sad. so we say we aren't sad. but really we are." 
 
and i said, "i'm not sad." 
 
and she said, "if you do start to fe

about it. because i think talking to me will help you feel less sad. and if you don't feel sad but you just

and i said, "i understand." 
 
and she said, "good." 
 
and i replied, "but i don't feel sad about it. because mother is dead. and because mr. shears isn't around 
anymore. so i would be feeling sad about something that isn't real and doesn't exist. and that would be 
stupid." 
 
and then i practiced maths for the rest of the morning and at lunch i didn't have the quiche because it was

i thought that this might be another rhetorical question, but i wasn't sure. i found it hard to work out what 
to say because i was starting to get scared and confused.

they didn't have bicycles in roman and greek times, which was when they called orion orion).

as 11:32 p.m. and i heard voices of people walking along the street. 
 
and a voice said, "i don't care whether you thought it was funny or not," and it was a lady's voice. 
 
and another voice said, "judy, look. i'm sorry, ok," and it was a man's voice. 
 
and the other voice, which was the lady's voice, said, "well, perhaps you should have thought about that 
before you made me look like a complete idiot." 
 
and the lady's voice was mother's voice. 

 
and mother came into the garden and mr. shears was with her, and the other voice was his. 
 
so i stood up and i said, "you weren't in, so i waited for you." 
 
and mother said, "christopher." 
 
and mr. shears said, "what?" 
 
and mother put her arms around me and said, "christopher, christopher, christopher." 
 
and i pushed her away because she was grabbing me and i didn't like it, and i pushed really hard and i 
fell over. 
 
and mr. shears said, "what the hell is going on?" 
 
and mother said, "i'm so sorry, christopher. i forgot."

that i could touch her fingers, but then i saw that toby had escaped out of my pockets so i had to catch 
him. 
 
and mr. shears said, "i suppose this means ed's here." and there was a wall around the garden so toby 
couldn't get out because he was stuck in the corner and he couldn't climb up the walls fast enough and i 
grabbed him and put him back in my pocket and i said, "he's hungry. have you got any food i can give 
him, and some water?" 
 
and mother said, "where's your father, christopher?" 
 
and i said, "i think he's in swindon." 
 
and mr. shears said, "thank god for that." 
 
and mother said, "but how did you g

cold and i couldn't stop them, and i said, "i 
came on the train. and it was really frightening. and i took father's cashpoint card so i could get money 
out and a policeman helped me. but then he wanted to take me back to father. and he was on the train 
with me. but then he wasn't." 
 
and mother said, "christopher, you're soaking. roger, don't just stand there." 
 
and then she said, "oh my god. christopher. i didn't. . . i didn't think i'd ever. . . why are you here on 
your own?" 
 
and mr. shears said, "are you going to come in or are you going to stay out here all night?" 
 
and  i  said,  "i'm  going  to  live  with  you  because  father  killed  wellington  with  a  garden  fork  and  i'm 
frightened of him." 
 
and mr. shears said, "jumping jack christ." 
 
and mother said, "roger, please. come on, christopher, let's go inside and get you dried off." 
 

so  i  stood  up  and  i  went  inside  the  house  and  mother  said,  "you  follow  roger,"  and  i  followed  mr. 
shears  up

 "of course he can stay." 
 
and then the policeman said, "well, i think that probably settles it as far as i'm concerned." 
 
and i said, "are you going to take me back to swindon?" 
 
and he said, "no." 
 
and then i was happy because i could live with mother. 
 
and the policeman said, "if your husband turns up and causes any trouble, just give us a ring. otherwise, 
you're going to have to sort this out between yourselves." 
 
and then the policeman went away and i had my tomato soup and mr. shears stacked up some boxes in 
the spare room so he could put a blowup mattress on the floor for me to sleep on, and i went to sleep. 
 
and then i woke up because there were people shouting in the flat and it was 2:31 a.m. and one of the 
people was father and i was frightened. but there wasn't a lock on the door of the spare room. 
 
and father shouted, "i'm talking to her whether you like it or not. and i am not going to be told what to 
do by you of all people." 
 
and mother shouted, "roger. don

and father shouted, "no right? no right? he's my fucking son, in case you've forgotten." 
 
and  mother  shouted,  "what  in  god's  name  did  you  think  you  were  playing  at,  saying  those  things  to

and father shouted, "what was i playing at? you were the one that bloody left."

and mr. shears shouted, "now let's us all just calm down here, shall we?" 
 
and father shouted, "well, isn't that what you wanted?" 

 
and mother shouted, "i wrote to him every week. every week." 
 
and father shouted, "wrote to him? what the fuck use is writing to him?" 
 
and mr. shears shouted, "whoa, whoa, whoa." 
 
and  father  shouted,  "i  cooked  his  meals.  i  cleaned  his  clothes.  i  looked  after  him  every  weekend.  i 
looked after him when he was ill. i took him to the doctor. i worried myself sick every time he wandered 
off somewhere at night. i went to school every time he got into a fight. and you? what? you wrote him 
some fucking letters." 
 
and mother shouted, "so you thought it was ok to tell him his mother was dead?"

and then he held up his right hand and spread his fingers out in a fan so that i could touch his fingers, but 
i didn't because i was frightened. 
 
and father said, "shit. christopher, please." 
 
and there were tears dripping off his face. 
 
and no one said anything for a while. 
 
and then mother said, "i think you should go now," but she was talking to father, not me. 
 
and then the policeman came back because mr. shears had rung the police station and he told father to 
calm down and he took him out of the flat. 
 
and mother said, "you go back to sleep now. everything is going to be all right. i promise." 
 
and then i went back to sleep.

and when i was asleep i had one of my favorite dreams. sometimes i have it during the day, but then it's 
a daydream. but i often have it at night as well. 
 
and in the dream nearly everyone on the earth is dead, because they have caught a virus. but it's not lik

the next morning i had fried tomatoes for breakfast and a tin of green beans which mother heated up in a 
saucepan. 
 
in the middle of breakfast, mr. shears said, "ok. he can stay for a few days." 
 
and mother said, "he can stay as long as he needs to stay." 
 
and mr. shears said, "this flat is hardly big enough for two people, let alone three." 
 
and mother said, "he can understand what you're saying, you know." 
 
and mr. shears said, "what's he going to do? there's no school for him to go to. we've both got jobs. it's 
bloody ridiculous." 
 
and mother said, "roger. that's enough." 
 
then she made me some red zinger herbal tea with sugar in i

t but i didn't like it, and she said, "you can 
stay for as long as you want to stay." 
 
and after mr. shears had gone  to work she made  a telephone call  to the office  and took what  is called 
compassionate leave, which is when someone in your family dies or is ill. 
 
then she said we had to go and buy some clothes for me to wear and some pajamas and a toothbrush and 
a flannel. so we went out of the flat and we walked to the main road, which was hill lane, which was the 
a4088,  and  it  was  really  crowded  and  we  caught  a  number  266  bus  to  brent  cross  shopping  centre.

ere too many people in john lewis and i was frightened and i lay down on the floor next 
to the wristwatches and i screamed and mother had to take me home in a taxi. 
 
then  she  had  to  go  back  to  the  shopping  center  to  buy  me  some  clothes  and  some  pajamas  and  a 
toothbrush and a flannel, so i stayed in the spare room while she was gone because i didn't want to be in 
the same room as mr. shears because i was frightened of him. 
 
and  when mother  got  home  she  brought  me  a  glass  of  strawberry  milk  shake  and  showed  me  my  new 
pajamas, and the pattern on them was 5-pointed blue stars on a purple background like this

and mother said, "you're doing maths a level?"

, at 10:51 p.m. i went out onto the balcony to find out whether i could see any stars, but there 
weren't  any  because  of  all  the  clouds  and  what  is  called  light  pollution,  which  is  light  from  streetlights 
and  car  headlights  and  floodlights  and  lights  in  buildings  reflecting  off  tiny  particles  in  the  atmosphere 
and getting in the way of light from the stars. so i went back inside. 
 
but i couldn't sleep. and i got out of bed at 2:07 a.m. and i felt scared of mr. shears so i went downstairs 
and out of the front door into chapter road. and there was no one in the street and it was quieter than it 
was  during  the  day,  even  though  you  could  hear  traffic  in  the  distance  and  sirens,  so  it  made  me  feel 
calmer.  and  i  walked  down  chapter  road  and  looked  at  all  the  cars  and  the  patterns  the  phone  wires 
made against the orange clouds and the things that people had in their front gardens, like a gnome and a 
cooker and a tiny pond a

ear to god, christopher, i love you, but. . . i don't know what i'll do." 
 
so she made  me promise never to leave the flat on  my own because it was dangerous and because you 
couldn't trust people in london because they were strangers. and the next day she had to go to the shops 
again and she made me promise not to answer the door if anyone rang the bell. and when she came back 
she brought some food pellets for toby and three star trek videos and i watched them in the living room 
until mr. shears came home and then i went into the spare room again. and i wished that 451c chapter 
road, london nw2 5ng, had a garden but it didn't. 
 
and the day after that the office where mother worked rang and told her she couldn't come back to work 
because they had got someone else to do her job for her, and she was really angry and she said that it was 
illegal and she was going to complain, but mr. shears said, "don't be a bloody fool. it was a temporary 
job, for christ's sake." 
 
and when mother c

 rung mrs. gascoyne and told her that i was going to take my maths 
a level next year, so i threw  my red ice  lolly away and i screamed for a  long time and  the pain in  my 
chest hurt so much that it was hard to breathe and a man came up and asked if i was ok and mother said, 
"well, what does it look like to you?" and he went away. 
 
and  then  i  was  tired  from  screaming  and  mother  took  me  back  to  the  flat  in  another  taxi  and  the  next 
morning was saturday and she told mr. shears to go out and get me some books about science and maths 
from the library, and they were called 100 number puzzles and the origins of the universe and nuclear 
power, but they were for children and they were not very good so i didn't read them, and mr. shears said, 
"well, it's nice to know my contribution is appreciated." 
 
and i hadn't eaten anything since i threw away the red ice lolly on hampstead heath, so mother made me 
a  chart  with  stars  on  it  like  when  i  was  very  small  and

 she  filled  a  measuring  jug  with  complan  and 
strawberry flavoring and i got a bronze star for drinking 200 ml and a silver star for drinking 400 ml and a 
gold star for drinking 600 ml. 
 
and when mother and mr. shears argued i took the little radio from the kitchen and i went and sat in the 
spare  room  and  i  tuned  it  halfway  between  two  stations  so  that  all  i  could  hear  was  white  noise  and  i 
turned the volume up really loud and i held it against my ear and the sound filled my head and it hurt so 
that i couldn't feel any other sort of hurt, like the hurt in my chest, and i couldn't hear mother and mr. 
shears arguing and i couldn't think about not doing my a level or the fact that there w

and then it was monday. and it was very late at night and mr. shears came into my room and woke me 
up and he had been drinking beer because he smelled like father did when he had been drinking beer with 
rhodri.  and  he  said,  "you  think  you're  so  fucking  clever,  don't  you.  don't  you  ever,  ever  think  about 
other people for one second, eh? well, i bet you're really pleased with yourself now, aren't you." 
 
and  then  mother  came  in  and  pulled  him  out of the  room  and  said,  "christopher,  i'm  sorry. i'm  really,

ext  morning,  after  mr.  shears  had  gone  to  work,  mother  packed  lots  of  her  clothes  into  two 
suitcases and told me to come downstairs and bring toby and get into the car. and she put the suitcases 
into the boot and we drove off. but it was mr. shears's car and i said, "are you stealing the car?" 
 
and she said, "i'm just borrowing it." 
 
and i said, "where are we going?" 
 
and she said, "we're going home." 
 
and i said, "do you mean home in swindon?" 
 
and she said, "yes."

my maths a level and it was like pressing your thumbnail against a radiator when it's really hot and the 
pain starts and it makes you want to cry and the pain keeps hurting even when you take your thumb away 
from the radiator. 
 
then mother made me some carrots and broccoli and ketchup, but i didn't eat them. 
 
and i didn't sleep that night either. 
 
the next day mother drove me to school in mr. shears's car because we missed the bus. and when we 
were  getting  into  the  car,  mrs.  shears  came  across  the  road  and  said  to  mother,  "you've  got  a  fucking 
nerve." 
 
and mother said, "get into the car, christopher." 
 
but i couldn't get into the car because the door was locked. 
 
and mrs. shears said, "so, has he finally dumped you, too?" 
 
then mother opened her door and got into the car and unlocked my door and i got in and we drove away. 
 
and  when we  got  to  school  siobhan  said,  "so  you're  christopher's  mother."  and siobhan  said  that  she

and i slept a little bit that night because i was doing my maths a level. and i had some spinach soup for 
supper. 
 
and  the  next  day  i  did  paper  2  and  the  reverend  peters  read  the  cost  of  discipleship  by  dietrich 
bonhoeffer, but this time he didn't smoke a cigarette and siobhan made me go into the toilets before the 
exam and sit on my own and do breathing and counting. 
 
and i was playing the 11th hour on my computer that evening when a taxi stopped outside the house. 
mr. shears was in the taxi and he got out of the taxi and threw a big cardboard box of things belonging to 
mother onto the lawn. and they were a hair dryer and some knickers and some l'oréal shampoo and a 
box of muesli and two books, diana: her true story by andrew morton and rivals by jilly cooper, 
and a photograph of me in a silver frame. and the glass in the photograph frame broke when it fell onto 
the grass. 
 
then he got some keys out of his pocket and got into his car and drove away and mother

the box of muesli and it hit the boot of his car as he drove away and mrs. shears was looking out of her 
window when mother did this. 
 
the next day i did paper 3 and the reverend peters read the daily mail and smoked three cigarettes.

and then he went away and i watched the rest of university challenge. 
 
and  the  next  week  father  told  mother  she  had  to  move  out  of  the  house,  but  she  couldn't  because  she 
didn't have any money to pay rent for a flat. and i asked if father would be arrested and go to prison for 
killing  wellington  because  we  could  live  in  the  house  if  he  was  in  prison.  but  mother  said  the  police 
would  only  arrest  father  if  mrs.  shears  did  what  is  called  pressing  charges,  which  is  telling  the  police 
you want them to arrest someone for a crime, because the police don't arrest people for little crimes unless 
you ask them and mother said that killing a dog was only a little crime. 
 
but then everything was ok because mother got a job on the till in a garden center and the doctor gave 
her pills to take every morning to stop her from feeling sad, except that sometimes they made her dizzy 
and she fell over if she sto
