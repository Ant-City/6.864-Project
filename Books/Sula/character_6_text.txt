y?" she asked.
"to give you these," and he nodded toward one of the
quarts of milk. "i don't like milk," she said. "but you like
bottles don't you?" he held one up. "ain't that pretty?" and
indeed it was. hanging from his fingers, framed by a slick
blue sky, it looked precious and clean and permanent. she
had the distinct impression that he had done something
dangerous to get them. sula ran her fingernails over the
screen thoughtfully for a second and then, laughing, she
opened the screen door. ajax came in and headed straight
for the kitchen. sula followed slowly. by the time she got to
the door he had undone the complicated wire cap and was
letting the cold milk run into his mouth. sula watched him--
or rather the rhythm in his throat-with growing interest.
when he had had enough, he poured the rest into the sink,
rinsed the bottle out and presented it to her. she took the
bottle with one hand and his wrist with the other and pulled
him into the pantry. there was no need to go there, for

wrapped in a salmon-colored sheet of the pittsburgh
_courier,__ a handful of jacks, two boxes of lime jell-well,
a hunk of ice-wagon ice, a can of old dutch cleanser with
the bonneted woman chasing dirt with her stick; a page of
tillie the toiler comics, and more gleaming white bottles of
milk. contrary to what anybody would have suspected from
just seeing him lounging around the pool hall, or shooting at
mr. finley for beating his own dog, or calling filthy
compliments to passing women, ajax was very nice to
women. his women, of course, knew it, and it provoked
them into murderous battles over him in the streets,
brawling thick-thighed women with knives disturbed many a
friday night with their bloodletting and attracted whooping
crowds. on such occasions ajax stood, along with the
crowd, and viewed the fighters with the same golden-eyed
indifference with which he watched old men playing
checkers. other than his mother, who sat in her shack with
six younger sons working roots, he had

 chew, devil's shoe string,
chinese wash, mustard seed and the nine herbs from
cincinnati. she knew about the weather, omens, the living,
the dead, dreams and all illnesses and made a modest
living with her skills. had she any teeth or ever straightened
her back, she would have been the most gorgeous thing
alive, worthy of her sons' worship for her beauty alone, if not
for the absolute freedom she allowed them (known in some
quarters as neglect) and the weight of her hoary
knowledge. this woman ajax loved, and after her--
airplanes. there was nothing in between. and when he was
not sitting enchanted listening to his mother's words, he
thought of airplanes, and pilots, and the deep sky that held
them both. people thought that those long trips he took to
large cities in the state were for some sophisticated good
times they could not imagine but only envy; actually he was
leaning against the barbed wire of airports, or nosing
around hangars just to hear the talk of the men who were

water. "soaking in sula give me a bad back."
"worth it?" "don't know yet. go 'way." "airplanes?"
"airplanes." "lindbergh know about you?" "go 'way." she
went and waited for him in eva's high bed, her head turned
to the boarded-up window. she was smiling, thinking how
like jude's was his craving to do the white man's work,
when two deweys came in with their beautiful teeth and
said, "we sick." sula turned her head slowly and
murmured, "get well." "we need some medicine." "look in
the bathroom." "ajax in there." "then wait." "we sick now."
sula leaned over the bed, picked up a shoe and threw it at
them. "cocksucker!" they screamed, and she leaped out of
the bed naked as a yard dog. she caught the redheaded
dewey by his shirt and held him by the heels over the
banister until he wet his pants. the other dewey was joined
by the third, and they delved into their pockets for stones,
which they threw at her. sula, ducking and tottering with
laughter, carried the wet dewey to the bedroom and when

e other two followed her, deprived of all weapons except
their teeth, sula had dropped the first dewey on the bed
and was fishing in her purse. she gave each of them a
dollar bill which they snatched and then scooted off down
the stairs to dick's to buy the catarrh remedy they loved to
drink. ajax came sopping wet into the room and lay down
on the bed to let the air dry him. they were both still for a
long time until he reached out and touched her arm. he
liked for her to mount him so he could see her towering
above him and call soft obscenities up into her face. as she
rocked there, swayed there, like a georgia pine on its
knees, high above the slipping, falling smile, high above the
golden eyes and the velvet helmet of hair, rocking, swaying,
she focused her thoughts to bar the creeping

two make__ _mud?__ he swallowed her mouth just as her
thighs had swallowed his genitals, and the house was very,
very quiet. * * * sula began to discover what possession
was. not love, perhaps, but possession or at least the
desire for it. she was astounded by so new and alien a
feeling. first there was the morning of the night before
when she actually wondered if ajax would come by that day.
then there was an afternoon when she stood before the
mirror finger-tracing the laugh lines around her mouth and
trying to decide whether she was good-looking or not. she
ended this deep perusal by tying a green ribbon in her hair.
the green silk made a rippling whisper as she slid it into
her hair--a whisper that could easily have been hannah's
chuckle, a soft slow nasal hiss she used to emit when
something amused her. like women sitting for two hours
under the marcellin

activity, and when ajax
came that evening, bringing her a reed whistle he had
carved that morning, not only was the green ribbon still in
her hair, but the bathroom was gleaming, the bed was
made, and the table was set for two. he gave her the reed
whistle, unlaced his shoes and sat in the rocking chair in
the kitchen. sula walked toward him and kissed his mouth.
he ran his fingers along the nape of her neck. "i bet you
ain't even missed tar baby, have you?" he asked.
"missed? no. where is he?" ajax smiled at her delicious
indifference. "jail." "since when?" "last saturday."
"picked up for drunk?" "little bit more than that," he
answered and went ahead to tell her about his own
involvement in another of tar baby's misfortunes. on
saturday afternoon tar baby had stumbled drunk into traffic
on the new river road. a woman driver swerved to avoid
him and hit another car. when the police came, they
recognized the woman as the mayor's niece and arrested
tar baby. later, after the word got out, aj

ax and two other
men went to the station to see about him. at first they
wouldn't let them in. but they relented after ajax and the
other two just stood around for one hour and a half and
repeated their request at regular intervals. when they finally
got permission to go in and looked in at him in the cell, he
was twisted up in a corner badly beaten and dressed in
nothing but extremely soiled underwear. ajax and the other
men asked the officer why tar baby couldn't have back his
clothes. "it ain't right," they said, "to let a grown man lay
around in his own shit." the policeman, obviously in
agreement with eva, who had always maintained that tar
baby was white, said that if the prisoner didn't like to live in
shit, he should come down out of those hills, and live like a
decent white man. more words were exchanged, hot words
and dark, and the whole thing ended with the arraignment
of the three black

men, and an appointment to appear in
civil court thursday next. ajax didn't seem too bothered by
any of it. more annoyed and inconvenienced than anything
else. he had had several messes with the police, mostly in
gambling raids, and regarded them as the natural hazards
of negro life. but sula, the green ribbon shining in her hair,
was flooded with an awareness of the impact of the outside
world on ajax. she stood up and arranged herself on the
arm of the rocking chair. putting her fingers deep into the
velvet of his hair, she murmured, "come on. lean on me."

for verification--his vital statistics: born 1901, height 5'11' ',
weight 152 lbs., eyes brown, hair black, color black. oh
yes, skin black. very black. so black that only a steady
careful rubbing with steel wool would remove it, and as it
was removed there was the glint of gold leaf and under the
gold leaf the cold alabaster and deep, deep down under
the cold alabaster more black only this time the black of
warm loam. but what was this? albert jacks? his name
was albert jacks? a. jacks. she had thought it was ajax.
all those years. even from the time she walked by the pool
hall and looked away from him sitting astride a wooden
chair, looked away to keep from seeing the wide space of
intolerable orderliness between his legs; the openness that
held no sign, no sign at all, of the animal that lurked in his
trousers; looked away from the insolent nostrils and the
smile that kept slipping and falling, falling, falling so she
wanted to reach out

seeded the land and growed up in these young people in
the dime store with the cash-register keys around their
necks. they were so different, these young people. so
different from the way she remembered them forty years
ago. jesus, there were some beautiful boys in 1921! look
like the whole world was bursting at the seams with them.
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen years old. jesus, they were fine.
l. p., paul freeman and his brother jake, mrs. scott's
twins--and ajax had a whole flock of younger brothers. they
hung out of attic windows, rode on car fenders, delivered
the coal, moved into medallion and moved out, visited
cousins, plowed, hoisted, lounged on the church steps,
careened on the school playground. the sun heated them
and the moon slid down their backs. god, the world was
_full__ of beautiful boys in 1921. nothing like these kids.
everything had changed. even the whores were better then:
