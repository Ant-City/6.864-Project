well, say sofia, i was so use to sitting up there next to her teaching her how to drive, that i just naturally clammed into
the front seat.

she stood outside on her side the car clearing her throat.

finally she say, sofia, with a little laugh. this is the south.

yes ma'am, i say.

she clear her throat, laugh some more. look where you sitting, she say.

i'm sitting where i always sit, i say.

that's the problem, she say. have you ever seen a white person and a colored sitting side by side in a car, when one

then us pull into the yard and all the children come crowding round the car. nobody told them i was coming, so they
don't know who i is. except the oldest two. they fall on me, and hug me. and then all the little ones start to hug me too. i
don't think they even notice i was sitting in the back of the car. odessa and jack come out after i was out, so they didn't
see it.


us all stand round kissing and hugging each other, miz millie just watching. finally, she lean out the window and say,
sofia, you only got the rest of the day. i'll be back to pick you up at five o'clock the children was all pulling me into the
house, so sort of over my shoulder i say. yes ma'am, and i thought i heard her drive off.

but fifteen minutes later, marion says. that white lady still out there.

i lean over the car window and try to show her which way to move the gears. but she flustered and all the children and
odessa and jack all standing round the porch watching her.

i go round on the other side. try to explain with my head poked through that window. she stripping gears aplenty by

so it end up with me and jack driving her back home in the pick-up, then jack driving me to town to git a mechanic, and at
five o'clock i was driving miz millie's car back to her house.

i spent fifteen minutes with my children.

and she been going on for months bout how ungrateful i is.

mr. look behind him. put that down, he say. women, always needing to cut this and shave that, and always

gumming up the razor.

shug got her hand on the razor now. she say. oh it look dull anyway. she take and sling it back in the shaving box.

all day long i act just like sofia. i stutter. i mutter to myself. i stumble bout the house crazy for mr. blood. in my

mind, he falling dead every which a way. by time night come, i can't speak. every time i open my mouth nothing come out
but a little burp.

shug tell everybody i got a fever and she put me to bed.

your everloving sister, nettie


dear god,


what with being shock, crying and blowing my nose, and trying to puzzle out words us don't know, it took a long time to

read just the first two or three letters. by the time us got up to where she good and settled in africa, mr. and grady

come home.

can you handle it? ast shug.

how i'm gon keep from killing him, i say.

don't kill, she say. nettie be coming home before long. don't make her have to look at you like us look at sofia.

but it so hard, i say, while shug empty her suitcase and put the letters inside.

hard to be christ too, say shug. but he manage. remember that. thou shalt not kill, he said. and probably wanted to add
on to that. starting with me. he knowed the fools he was dealing with.

but mr. not christ. i'm not christ, i say.

you somebody to nettie, she say. and she be pissed if you change on her while she on her way home.

us hear grady and mr. in the kitchen. dishes rattling, safe door open and shut.
 
 ___________________________
 

well, say shug, if he came to any of these churches we talking bout he'd have to have it conked before anybody paid him
any attention. the last thing niggers want to think about they god is that his hair kinky.

that's the truth, i say.

ain't no way to read the bible and not think god white, she say. then she sigh. when i found out i thought god was
white, and a man, i lost interest. you mad cause he don't seem to listen to your prayers. humph! do the mayor listen to
anything colored say? ask sofia, she say.

but i don't have to ast sofia. i know white people never listen to colored, period. if they do, they only listen long enough
to be able to tell you what to do.

here's the thing, say shug. the thing i believe. god is inside you and inside everybody else. you come into the world with
god. but only them that search for it inside find it. and sometimes it just manifest itself even if you not looking, or don't
know what you looking for. trouble do it for most folks, i think. sorrow, lord

 other end of it, tell him to git lost, say shug. conjure up flowers, wind, water, a big rock.

but this hard work, let me tell you. he been there so long, he don't want to budge. he threaten lightening, floods and
earthquakes. us fight. i hardly pray at all. every time i conjure up a rock, i throw it.


amen


dear nettie,


when i told shug i'm writing to you instead of to god, she laugh. nettie don't know these people, she say. considering
who i been writing to, this strike me funny.

it was sofia you saw working as the mayor's maid. the woman you saw carrying the white woman's packages that day in

town. sofia mr. 's son harpo's wife. polices lock her up for sassing the mayor's wife and hitting the mayor back. first

she was in prison working in the laundry and dying fast. then us got her move to the mayor's house. she had to sleep in a
little room up under the house, but it was better than prison. flies, maybe, but no rats.

anyhow, they kept her eleven and a half years, give her six m

they wives have to put up with.

they all march stoutly in, shaking the church, and place sofia mother in front the pulpit.

folks crying and fanning and trying to keep a stray eye on they children, but they don't stare at sofia and her sisters. they
act like this the way it always done. i love folks.

great goodness of life, i say.

yeah, he say. it hard for sofia. she still have to try to prop up that white gal she raise. now her mama dead. her health
not that good either. plus, henrietta a hard row to hoe whether she sick or well.

oh, she a little mess, i say. then i think back to one of nettie's letters bout the sicknesses children have where she at in

mr. stand waiting for me to say something, looking off up to his house. finally he say. good evening, and walk

away.

sofia say after i left, mr. live like a pig. shut up in the house so much it stunk. wouldn't let nobody in until finally

harpo force his way in. clean the house, got food. give his daddy a bath. mr. too weak to fight back. plus, too far

gone to care.

he couldn't sleep, she say. at night he thought he heard bats outside the door. other things rattling in the chimney. but
the worse part was having to listen to his own heart. it did pretty well as long as there was daylight, but soon as night

eyes clamp on different pieces of furniture, see if they move in his direction. you know how little he is, say sofia. and how
big and stout harpo is. well, one night i walked up to tell harpo something— and the two of them was just laying there on
the bed fast asleep. harpo holding his daddy in his arms.

after that, i start to feel again for harpo, sofia say. and pretty soon us start work on our new house. she laugh. but did i
say it been easy? if i did, god would make me cut my own switch.

throw whatever it is out the window. us tell her in a little while she'll have three months not to eat yams, but she say that
day don't seem like it ever want to come. meanwhile, her joints all swole, she hot enough to burn, she say her head feel
like its full of little white men with hammers.

sometime i meet up with mr. visiting henrietta. he dream up his own little sneaky recipes. for instance, one time

he hid the yams in peanut butter. us sit by the fire with harpo and sofia and play a hand or two of bid whist, while suzie
q. and henrietta listen to the radio. sometime he drive me home in his car. he still live in the same little house. he been
there so long, it look just like him. two straight chairs always on the porch, turned against the wall. porch railings with
flower cans on them. he keep it painted now though. fresh and white. and guess what he collect just cause he like them?
he collect shells. all kinds of shells. tarrapin, snail and all kinds of shells fr

matter of fact, that's how he got me up to the house again. he was telling sofia bout some new shell he had that made a
loud sea sound when you put it to your ear. us went up to see it. it was big and heavy and speckled like a chicken and
sure enough, seem like you could hear the waves or something crashing against your ear. none of us ever seen the ocean,

but mr. learn about it from books. he order shells from books too, and they all over the place.

he don't say that much about them while you looking, but he hold each one like it just arrive.

shug one time had a seashel

and two, shug use to love him. plus, look like he trying to make something out of himself. i don't mean just that he work
and he clean up after himself and he appreciate some of the things god was playful enough to make. i mean when you
talk to him now he really listen, and one time, out of nowhere in the conversation us was having, he said celie, i'm
satisfied this the first time i ever lived on earth as a natural man. it feel like a new experience.

sofia and harpo always try to set me up with some man. they know i love shug but they think womens love just by

accident, anybody handy likely to do. everytime i go to harpo's some little policy salesman git all up in my face. mr.

have to come to the rescue. he tell the man. this lady my wife. the man vanish out the door.

us sit, have a cold drink. talk about our days together with shug. talk about the time she come home sick. the little

who could forgit it? i say.

us don't say nothing bout sofia's troubles. us still cant laugh at that. plus, sofia still have trouble with that family. well,
trouble with miss eleanor jane.

you just don't know, say sofia, what that girl done put me through. you know how she use to bother me all the time
when she had problems at home? well finally she start bothering me when anything good happen. soon as she snag that
man she married she come running to me. oh, sofia, she say, you just have to meet stanley earl. and before i can say
anything, stanley earl is in the middle of my front room.

what. stanley earl snap his fingers and try to tap one of his good size foots. he got a long head go straight up and hair cut
so short it look fuzzy. his eyes real bright blue and never hardly blink. good god, i think.


sofia raise me, practically, say miss eleanor jane. don't know what we would have done without her.

well, say stanley earl, everybody round here raise by colored. that's how come we turn out so well. he wink at me, say.

well, say sofia, one thing you have to say for miss eleanor jane, her dishes almost always fool henrietta. and that mean a
lots to me. of course i never tell henrietta where they come from. if i did, out the window they would go. else she'd
vomit, like it made her sick.

but finally, the end come to sofia and miss eleanor jane, i think. and it wasn't nothing to do with henrietta, who hate
miss eleanor jane's guts. it was miss eleanor jane herself and that baby she went and had. every time sofia turned round
miss eleanor jane was shoving reynolds stanley earl in her face. he a little fat white something without much hair, look
like he headed for the navy.

ain't little reynolds sweet? say miss eleanor jane, to sofia. daddy just love him, she say. love having a grandchild name
for him and look so

much like him, too.

sofia don't say nothing, stand there ironing some of susie q. and henrietta's clothes.

and so smart, say eleanor jane. daddy say he never saw a smarter baby. stanley earl's mama say he smarter than stanley
earl was when he was this age.

sofia still don't say nothing.

finally eleanor jane notice. and you know how some whitefolks is, won't let well enough alone. if they want to bad
enough, they gon harass a blessing from you if it kill.

sofia mighty quiet this morning. miss eleanor jane say, like she just talking to reynolds stanley. he stare back at her out
of his big stuck open eyes.

don't you think he sweet? she ast again.

he sure fat, say sofia, turning over the dress she ironing.

and he sweet, too, say miss eleanor jane.

just as plump as he can be, say sofia. and tall.

 saw? she ast sofia.

he got a nice size head on him, say sofia. you know some peoples place a lot of weight on head size. not a whole lot of
hair on it either. he gon be cool this summer, for sure. she fold the piece she iron and put it on a chair.

just a sweet, smart, cute, innocent little baby boy, say miss eleanor jane. don't you just love him? she ast sofia point
blank.

sofia sigh. put down her iron. stare at miss eleanor jane and reynolds stanley. all the time me and henrietta over in the
corner playing pitty pat. henrietta act like miss eleanor jane ain't alive, but both of us hear the way the iron sound when
sofia put it down. the sound have a lot of old and new stuff in it.

no ma'am, say sofia. i do not love reynolds stanley earl. now. that's what you been trying to find out ever since he was
born. and now you know.

me and henrietta look up. miss eleanor jane

just that quick done put reynolds stanley on the floor where he crawling
round knocking stuff over. head straight for sofia's stack of ironed clothes and pull it down on his head. sofia take up the
clothes, straighten them out, stand by the ironing board with her hand on the iron. sofia the kind of woman no matter
what she have in her hand it look like a weapon.

eleanor jane start to cry. she always have felt something for sofia. if not for her, sofia never would have survive living in
her daddy's house. but so what? sofia never wanted to be there in the first place. never wanted to leave her own
children.

too late to cry. miss eleanor jane, say sofia. all us can do now is laugh. look at him, she say. and she do laugh. he can't
even walk and already he in my house messing it up. did i ast him to come? do i care whether he sweet or not? will it
make any difference in the way he grow up to treat me what i think?

you just don't like him cause

 he look like daddy, say miss eleanor jane.

you don't like him cause he look like daddy, say sofia. i don't feel nothing about him at all. i don't love him, i don't hate
him. i just wish he couldn't run loose all the time messing up folks stuff.

all the time! all the time! say miss eleanor jane. sofia, he just a baby. not even a year old. he only been here five or six
times.

i feel like he been here forever, say sofia.

i just don't understand, say miss eleanor jane. all the other colored women i know love children. the way you feel is
something unnatural.

i love children, say sofia. but all the colored women that say they love yours is lying. they don't love reynolds stanley any
more than i do. but if you so badly raise as to ast 'em, what you expect them to say? some colored people so scared of


whitefolks they claim to love the cotton gin.

but he just a little baby! say miss eleanor jane, like saying t

his is spose to clear up everything.

what you want from me? say sofia. i feel something for you because out of all the people in your daddy's house you
showed me some human kindness. but on the other hand, out of all the people in your daddy's house, i showed you
some. kind feeling is all i have to offer you. i don't have nothing to offer your relatives but just what they offer me. i don't
have nothing to offer him.

reynolds stanley by this time is over on henrietta pallet look like trying to rape her foot. finally he start to chew her leg
and henrietta reach up

 on the windowsill and hand him a cracker.

i feel like you the only person love me, say miss eleanor jane. mama only love junior, she say. cause that's who daddy
really love.

well, say sofia. you got your own husband to love you now.

look like he don't love nothing but that cotton gin, she say. ten o'clock at night and he still down there working. when he
not working, he playing poker with the boys. my brother see a lot more of stanley earl than i do.

maybe you ought to leave him, say sofia. you got kin in atlanta, go stay with some of them. git a job.

miss eleanor jane toss her hair back, act like she don't even hear this, it such a wild notion.

i got my own troubles, say sofia, and when reynolds stanley grow up, he's gon be one of them.

but he won't, say miss eleanor jane. i'm his mama and i won't let him be mean to colored.

you and whose army? say sofia. the first word he likely to speak won't be nothing he learn from you.

you telling me i won't even be able to love my own
 
 ___________________________
 
 son, say miss eleanor jane.

no, say sofia. that's not what i'm telling you. i'm telling you i won't be able to love your own son. you can love him just as
much as you want to. but be ready to suffer the consequences. that's how the colored live.

little reynolds stanley all up on top henrietta's face by now, just slobbering and sucking. trying to kiss. any second i think
she gon knock him silly. but she lay real still while he zamine her. every once in a while he act like he peeking into her
eyeball. then he sit down with a bounce on t

op her chest and grin. he take one of her playing cards and try to give her a
bite of it.

sofia come over and lift him off.

he not bothering me, say henrietta. he make me tickle.

he bother me, say sofia.

well, miss eleanor jane say to the baby, picking him up, we not wanted here. she say it real sad, like she done run out of
places to go.

thank you for all you done for us, say sofia. she don't look so good herself, and a little water stand in her eyes. after miss
eleanor jane and reynolds stanley leave, she say. it's times like this make me know us didn't make this world. and all the
colored folks talking bout loving everybody just ain't looked hard at what they thought they said.

so what else new?

well, your sister too crazy to kill herself. most times i feels like shit but i felt like shit before in my life and what happen? i
had me a fine sister name nettie. i had me

nd i miss her. i miss her friendship so much
that if she want to come back here dragging germaine i'd make them both welcome, or die trying. who am i to tell her
who to love? my job just to love her good and true myself.

mr. ast me the other day what it is i love so much bout shug. he say he love her style. he say to tell the truth, shug

act more manly than most men. i mean she upright, honest. speak her mind and the devil take the hindmost, he say. you
know shug will fight, he say. just like sofia. she bound to live her life and be herself no matter what.

mr. think all this is stuff men do. but harpo not like this, i tell him. you not like this. what shug got is womanly it

seem like to me. specially since she and sofia the ones got it.

sofia and shug not like men, he say, but they not like women either.

you mean they not like you or me.

they hold they own, he say. and it's different

what i love best bout shug is what she been through, i say. when you look in shug's eyes you know sh

think i'm down here suffering from not knowing. but nothing happen at the state department. nothing at the department
of defense. it's a big war. so much going on. one ship lost feel like nothing, i guess. plus, colored don't count to those
people.

well, they just don't know, and never did. never will. and so what? i know you on your way home and you may not git
here till i'm ninety, but one of these days i do expect to see your face.

meanwhile, i hired sofia to clerk in our store. kept the white man alphonso got to run it, but put sofia in there to wait on
colored cause they never had nobody in a store to wait on 'em before and nobody in a store to treat 'em nice. sofia real
good at selling stuff too cause she act like she don't care if you buy or not. no skin off her nose. and then if you decide to
buy anyhow, well, she might exchange a few pleasant words with you. plus, she scare that white man. anybody else
colored he try to call 'em auntie or s

say, sofia got me a little help for when henrietta need anything special to eat or git sick.

yeah, say sofia. miss eleanor jane gon look in on henrietta and every other day promise to cook her something she'll eat.
you know white people have a look of machinery in they kitchen. she whip up stuff with yams you'd never believe. last
week she went and made yam ice cream.

i don't expect it to last, though, say harpo. you know how they is.

they know, say sofia. they carrying on just like you know they would. whoever heard of a white woman working for
niggers, they rave. she tell them. whoever heard of somebody like sofia working for trash.

henrietta say she don't mind him.

well, say harpo, i'm satisfied if her menfolks against her helping you, she gon quit.

let her quit, say sofia. it not my salvation she working for. and if she don't learn she got to face judgment for herself, she
won't even have live.

well, you got me behind you, anyway, say harpo. and i loves every judgment you ever made. he move up and kiss her
where her nose was stitch.

nothing if you don't ask why you here, period.

so what you think? i ask.

i think us here to wonder, myself. to wonder. to ask. and that in wondering bout the big things and asking bout the big
things, you learn about the little ones, almost by accident. but you never know nothing more about the big things than
you start out with. the more i wonder, he say, the more i love.


and people start to love you back, i bet, i say.

they do, he say, surprise. harpo seem to love me. sofia and the children. i think even ole evil henrietta love me a little bit,
but that's cause she know she just as big a mystery to me as the man in the moon.

mr. is busy patterning a shirt for folks to wear with my pants.

got to have pockets, he say. got to have loose sleeves. and definitely you not spose to wear it with no tie. folks wearing
ties look like they being lynch.

the potato salad. mary agnes come back home to pick up suzie q. she done left grady, move back to memphis and live
with her sister and her ma. they gon look after suzie q while she work. she got a lot of new songs, she say, and not too
knocked out to sing 'em.
