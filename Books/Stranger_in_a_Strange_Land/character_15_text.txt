grapevine.
 but first jill went to the floor's public booth and called ben. his office informed her that mr.
caxton had just left town, to be gone a few days. she was startled almost speechless by this-then pulled
herself together and left word for ben to call her.
 she then called his home. he was not there; she recorded the same message.


 ben caxton had wasted no time in preparing his attempt to force his way into the presence of
valentine michael smith. he was lucky in being able to retain james oliver cavendish as his fair
witness. while any fair witness would do, the prestige of cavendish was such that a lawyer was hardly
necessary-the old gentleman had testified many times before the high court of the federation and it was
said that the wills locked up in his head represented not billions but trillions. cavendish had received his

 "well?"
 harshaw shrugged. "the records show that that cab was in for repairs and was never in use
thursday morning. that gives us two choices: either a fair witness misread or misremembered a cab's
