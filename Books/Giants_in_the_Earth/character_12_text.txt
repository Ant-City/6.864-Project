"you ought to have a whaling for that, per hansa!" she said with a laugh, but immediately grew serious. . . . "alas! life lays a hard hand on all of us! . . . well, now i'm off. you don't need to hurry to-night--if we need you, i'll send ola."

per hansa stood there in the darkness of the winter night, looking after the disappearing figure. . . . no, her equal was not to be found! she could be both minister and father confessor, that woman!

he had barely entered hans olsa's house, found a seat, and lighted his pipe, when another visitor arrived. tonseten came in, apparently in a bad humour; no, he didn't want to sit down; he was going farther on in a minute or two. did they know that the solum boys were about to leave?

"i guess we know as much as you do," said per hansa, dryly. . . . "there's such a lot going on around here these days!"

"but this won't do, folks, i tell you--it simpl

ing over a tiny bundle; out of the bundle at intervals came faint, wheezy chirrups, like the sounds that rise from a nest of young birds.

an irresistible force drew per hansa to the bed. . . . she lay sound asleep. . . . thank god, that awful look of dread had not come back! he straightened himself up and glanced around the room; never before had he seen anything that looked so beautiful. . . .

sörine got up, went to the table, and bared a little rosy human head.

"if you are going to be the minister here," she said, turning to her husband, who had remained standing motionless at the door, "then you must hurry up and get ready. . . . first of all you must wash your hands."

the next moment they had all gathered around the table.

"here's the book. . . . just read it out as well as you can, and we'll do whatever the book says," sörine encouraged her husband. she seemed to have taken charge of the ceremony, and spoke in low, reassuring tones, as if she had done nothing else all her life but

. . . no, they could not agree over their claims. nor did they fare any better when it came to determining the newcomer's destiny.

henry, with an idea of eventually getting rid of his job, wanted the boy to be a schoolmaster. . . . but no, the godmothers wouldn't listen to the proposal. schoolmaster! as if that were good enough for such a boy! besides, they already had a schoolmaster. at this point kjersti lifted up her voice and announced that he should be a minister. then sörine laughed and winked at her husband. minister? . . . oh, they already had a minister, too--one of a sort; the boy had been baptized quite in the proper christian manner! . . . as far as she could see, the newcomer would have to be a doctor. but this proposal started per hansa up with a new objection. hadn't they doctors enough already, too? . . . there was kjersti, and there was sörine, and here he sat himself. why, they had nothing but doctors! . . . sam made them all laugh with h

of course."

"yes, if they were such dumb crows as you and ola! . . . now, hans, how many were left?"

"none," answered hans, thoughtfully.

"righto! there were none left . . . but say, hans, what do you think became of the others?"

"aw . . ." drawled the boy in his deep voice, "i suppose they flew away."

"sure they did! . . . why should they keep on sitting there?" . . .

tönseten was in a sparkling humour.

"now we will just try another one. listen hard now, sofie; this one is for you. the minister had three daughters, and the deacon also had three; but when the deacon's daughters were with the minister's daughters, there were no more than three. how can that be explained?"

the problem was simply senseless, laughed sofie; when there were six, there simply must be six, and no way out of it! . . .

"don't listen to him," said ole. "he's only fooling!"

"fooling!" thundered tönseten. "it seems to me that you are doing the fooling. . . . well, hansy, you will have to go at it again!"

of the grown people had heard this riddle before. they laughed heartily and thought it great fun. kjersti's knitting sank into her lap. . . . no doubt about it. syvert was clever at asking questions!

"hans," said tönseten, sternly, "put your brains to work!"

"i--i suppose there was only one man with daughters?" submitted store-hans, carefully.

"did you ever see the like of the cleverness in that boy! . . . yes; you see, the fact of it was that the minister was a deacon in his own church. very likely there wasn't anyone else who could serve as deacon!"

tönseten gave store-hans a fatherly pat on the head. . . . "there's much good stuff inside that skull of yours. i think you'll be a minister, after all."

and then tönseten straightened up and turned to face henry. . . . "that's the way to ask questions, henry!" . . . his face was red from his efforts; he looked ridiculously fierce as he sat down.

out his father. the boy turned to the field and spoke in a voice thrilled with delight:

"isn't it dandy?"

the silence continued for a while longer. but at last his father cleared his throat. "come here, store-hans!" per hansa placed his hand on the boy's shoulder. "what are you going to be when you grow up?"

"when i grow up?" repeated the boy, wonderingly. "well, a general . . . one like grant."

per hansa looked at him, a strange chuckling sound issuing from his throat:

"what about being a minister? . . . we need a minister more."

"oh, well," said store-hans, indifferently. "i suppose i can be that, too. . . . don't you think we can get a shotgun pretty soon?"

per hansa was a different man when he walked home; the spring had come back to his step. entering the house, he sat down by his wife, who was still reading the bible, and said, abruptly:

"you'd better read us a chapter!" then he cleared his throat and looked around the room. "no more nonsense, boys! come here and sit down quietly

, slowly. there she paused; moving behind her husband, she took her hand from under her apron and gave a pull at his jacket; she had now looked the stranger over and didn't feel altogether relieved. . . .

tönseten was too preoccupied with himself to notice her. "i am asking you," he said with pompous dignity, "what kind of a fellow you are and what you are after. are you looking for land?"

the stranger put his hands against his sides, looked straight at them, and said, impressively:

"i am a minister. as for you, my good man, you ought not to stand there swearing into the face of strangers! . . . now let me ask you again: may i stop here to-night?"

"good heavens!" exclaimed tönseten, letting his breath go as if some one had hit him in the stomach.

"oh, my! oh, my!" wailed kjersti, awe-stricken, yet overwhelmed with joy. "is the man crazy? can he really be a minister? . . . of course he must stop here, if he can only eat the stuff we have!"

"don't worry about that, mother." he turned to

her husband. "and now you and i will attend to the horse."

tönseten's knees were weak from penitent zeal; he trembled with eagerness to help; he wanted to talk, but his voice failed and the words would not come. but the horse was wonderfully well cared for; he even went back a second time, after they were through, to spread another layer of straw for bedding. while they worked the minister had many questions to ask; they took their own time about coming in.

at last tönseten ushered the minister into the hut, placed a chair at the farthest end of the table, and bade him be seated. the table now was laid with a white tablecloth, on which had been placed a superabundance of food for only one person; there were römmekolle and flatbröd, fresh milk and boiled eggs; there were coffee and cakes; but even so, kjersti thought it too little to offer such a distinguished visitor; now she was busy frying a couple of egg pancakes. thank goodness, there was plenty of what she had! she had hurriedl

y tidied up the room; it looked cozy and comfortable inside the hut, and the minister could not refrain from expressing his admiration.

finally he sat up to the table and began to eat, praising everything that he tasted and helping himself bountifully, like a healthy person whose hunger has been sharpened by a long fast.

tönseten remained standing in the middle of the floor, talking with the minister; his manner was humble almost to the point of unction, his voice had taken on a tone of great solemnity. kjersti hung in the background by the stove, where the room lay in shadow, listening closely to the conversation; she was more concerned about what her husband said than to follow the minister's discourse--syvert was so easily excited, poor fellow, and had so little experience in talking to people of quality! she watched the minister as he helped himself liberally to the food, and felt the b

them so pleasantly and naturally! no traces of sermonizing in his talk! why, he and syvert were just discussing ordinary everyday things--about conditions as they were around there, about crops and prospects, about the best way to run a farm. . . . now and then tönseten would turn their conversation toward the future; he was more interested in visualizing how things were going to turn out than in making a bare statement of how they actually were; that was something he could enlarge upon to the minister! and the minister seemed to have much good advice; thus they ought to do with that, he said, and so with this, but differently with the other. . . . at length he inquired about the religious life of the people in this locality. tönseten cleared his throat at the question, which he had been expecting, and answered emphatically that that was a subject on which he wasn't very well posted; you couldn't expect a common farmer to know much about such matters. and then he began hurriedly to ask the p

astor which way he had come, and whether he had seen many settlers in the parts through which he had travelled. this, in turn, gave him an opportunity to tell how the country looked hereabouts when he had first arrived six years ago; he waxed so eloquent on this point that it seemed difficult for him to stop. . . . kjersti realized that he was now on extremely dangerous ground!--

at last the minister had finished his meal.

"now then, my good man, be silent, and we will thank the lord for this day."

"yes, yes--of course!" . . . tönseten blew his nose vigorously; but not knowing what to do with himself next, he stuck his thumbs inside his trousers-band, and stood where he was in the middle of the floor, utterly unnerved.

kjersti sank down on the wood-box, and wiped her eyes with her apron. . . . she wanted to tell her husband to sit down, but simply couldn't screw up her courage to do it.

placing his folded hands on the table, the minister began in a quiet way, as if addressing some one they could not see who stood very near; he seemed to be well acquainted with this unseen being, for he spoke in a low voice and very intimately, as to a dear friend who, unexpectedly, had done him a good turn. he thanked him for the day that now was past, nevermore to return, entreating him to cast into the ocean of grace all sins committed on this day; he prayed long and earnestly for the people out here, for the house in which he sat, and especi

 but he must not be too severe with these poor people, for they had wandered far from home and some had gone astray, and long had they dwelt out here in the great wilderness, without a shepherd and without care. truly, life had not been easy for them! . . . after saying amen, he remained silent for some time, with hands still folded; from the candle on the table a pale glow was thrown over his face, touching the fringe of his beard with pure silver. . . . peace had fallen on the room.

then the minister arose.

"praise be to god, and thanks to you, good people, for this sumptuous feast!"

tönseten again blew his nose violently; then, overcome with confusion, he wheeled about and walked out of the hut.

kjersti sat on the wood-box, weeping with mingled emotions. the minister came over and took her by the hand. "a fine meal you prepared for me, mother, and here are my heartfelt thanks!"

"oh, well--that's nothing!" . . . she shook her head speechlessly, but could not let go his hand.

nt tönseten returned. . . . this would never do, he wanted to explain. he wasn't such a bad case as the minister seemed to think. he ought to hear some of the others when they let themselves go! . . . but as soon as he stood in the presence of the pastor, confusion overcame him again; he merely stuttered and stammered, and found nothing to say.

the minister now opened his satchel; first of all he took out a large, fat pouch, and then an ancient pipe, which he carefully cleaned and promptly filled. "a little incense, i think, will now be blessedly enjoyable. . . . no, just remain seated, mother."

the sleeping quarters assigned to the minister were the spare sod house, a structure which was now to be found on every farm. clothes were hung in it, and food was stored there, as well as tools and farm implements; it might even contain a black

smith's shop and a carpenter's bench, if the size of the room was sufficient; but nearly always there was a bed, made and ready for use.

but the minister seemed more anxious to visit with them than to go to bed; he smoked pipe after pipe, striking it against his toe to knock out the ashes, each time filling and lighting it anew. he asked them all about their life, and the struggle they had had since they came to this place. this was rich for tönseten; he never tired of telling. . . . finally the minister knocked out the ashes of his pipe for the last time, got up, and laid it carefully aside.

"well, now the day is done, and a fine, blessed day

 it has been; the night is approaching, so let us enjoy sweet repose. . . . where do you intend to put me up for the night, mother?"

both kjersti and tönseten felt that they must accompany him to the other hut. there stood the bed, with a small table at its side, covered with a rose-coloured cloth; the room was small and crowded, but seemed cozy and cheerful withal.

"oh, here it will be sweet to stretch one's weary limbs!" exclaimed the minister, joyfully.

"what a wonderful man he is!" thought kjersti. she began to make many excuses because they had nothing better to offer.

with a mixture of jest and earnestness the minister rebuked her for such talk; soon they were all three laughing together, and it was so pleasant that the hosts could hardly tear themselves away.

tönseten had aged considerably in the last two years; one who had known him before that time would scarcely recognize him now. he had struggled with a bad cough for two

 consecutive springs; this spring it had been so violent at times that he feared the end had come; but kjersti had finally managed to boil and dose it out of him. it had left its mark, however; he became easily tired now, and needed a lot of sleep in order to keep going.

but to-night he didn't get much sleep; and what little there was brought no rest. serious things to think about had suddenly come forward. . . . oh, my god! . . .

he would have liked to stay with the minister for a private and confidential talk; but he knew that kjersti would never go away and leave them alone. while she was clearing the table, after they had gone back to their own house, he slipped out and walked over to the other hut; but when he got there he realized that it was too late; he couldn't talk to the minister to-night--it would never do to disturb him now.

at last they went to bed together, tönseten and his wife. kjersti lost consciousness almost at once; but syvert lay awake a long

 while, pondering over how he might be able to gain the ear of the minister. . . . "to-morrow morning," he thought, "before the minister shows up, i'll take some wash water over to him. i'll sit down in the doorway while he washes, where i can see if anyone is coming; then, maybe, i'll get a chance to talk with him. . . . i'll tell him everything. there's going to be the devil to pay! useless to try any tricks here--i can't get out of it. his eyes are too keen--they see right through you! . . . but suppose kjersti comes along while we are talking? well, there you are! he would be likely to refer to it again when we go over to th

. until last spring he hadn't known it, either; but at that time, when he was lying prostrate and the cough was threatening to make an end of him, he had come to a full realization of the enormity of his deed; since then it had hung over him like a dark shadow, growing deeper and deeper the longer he turned it in his mind. . . . just imagine a perfectly innocent man getting himself into such a fix! but had anyone, innocent or guilty, ever committed a sin like the one that lay at his door?

this minister seemed to have a lot of sense, though; perhaps he might understand that it wasn't altogether syvert's fault, in a manner of speaking. . . . they had come to him, you see--he couldn't get out of it. he had been legally elected, too; and one of the specified duties of his office was to do just this thing. surely those who had laid down the law and forced ignorant people to perform such acts ought to be made to bear part of the blame! . . . of course, he might have objected. oh yes, that was just

it--he might have refused. that was probably just what the minister would say; he felt it in his bones. great god, what a mess! . . . the picture of it passed before his mind in rank and file, clearly and distinctly; he could both see and hear the actors of that hateful drama; and so he lived it over once more to the last detail, muttering to himself, and turning alternately hot and cold.

it would be just four years the coming fall since this transgression had taken place. . . . it had even happened on a sunday afternoon. . . . well, perhaps that wasn't so bad

mself--he had tried to get out of it! he had insisted that he didn't know how--the neighbours could testify to that! . . .

the worst of it was that the young people had made merry with him about it, both then and afterward; they had hurrahed for the "parson" as well as for the bridal couple, and had applauded the whole ceremony as if it were a joke. . . . and johannes and josie had moved at once into a house of their own and had lived together as man and wife ever since. . . . what infamy! the minister would simply have to do something about it! . . . oh yes, he recalled the whole damnable business. . . .

why, hadn't the two principals themselves, johannes and josie, stood before him without a sign of seriousness in their attitude; hadn't they even laughed right into his face? . . . and he couldn't be certain that he, too, hadn't smiled, although he had tried hard to keep his face straight. . . . then he had taken her hand and placed it in johannes's. . . . no, now let's see, it must have be

anything else to say. and josie had looked up brightly into his face, her eyes snapping with mischief--she was such a pretty girl and had laughed so happily! . . . since then these two had lived together as man and wife--in infamy! but after all, no serious calamity had befallen them, save that the children had come so terribly close together; at any rate, they were all pretty and well shaped! . . . huf! huf! . . .

tönseten turned over for the twentieth time. oh, well, he would confess to the minister in the morning, let the chastising be ever so severe. he must be absolved of this sin! if that cough should return next winter, there was no telling what might happen! . . .

since children baptized at home could be rebaptized by a minister, as if the religious ceremony had only been postponed, there was no logical reason why a matter like this couldn't be mended!

at breakfast next morning the minister kept asking a host of questions; he inquired at length about everything that his brief surve

y had shown him: who lived in this hut and who lived in that? who had built the big houses? how had those men happened to prosper ahead of the others?

tönseten sat at the opposite end of the table, where he was served separately. this morning he didn't seem to have any appetite--he couldn't relish his food. . . . it was astonishing how many things the minister found to ask questions about. . . . throughout the breakfast tönseten sat in the grip of a silent fear, afraid of what might come next; as soon as the meal was safely over, he found a pretext for leaving the room.

a few moments later the minister came out into the yard, with his satchel in his hand, and glanced around at the neighbourhood where he had arrived. in his wake came kjersti, bashfully tripping out of the house; tönseten walked restlessly about the yard, handling one thing after an

. . . who lived directly west of them?

. . . why, that was hans olsa--that is to say, hans vaag.

. . . and to the north?

. . . that was per holm--or rather per hansa, as he was called.

the minister scrutinized closely that part of the settlement visible from where they stood; then he went on with his inquiries about the people. . . . where was the largest house? . . . did he mean the biggest room? well, that was at per holm's; he had gone ahead and built on a big scale the very spring he came out; people had thought him crazy for putting up such a sod house, but it had turned out that he wasn't so crazy, after all. . . . torkel tallaksen was now building a grand house of lumber, that woul

d surely be a mansion when it was finished; but it wasn't done yet. . . .

"well, now, let's get to work," said the minister, resolutely. "first of all, my good man, i must get you to help me. will you hurry around to all your neighbours and tell them that to-day, at two o'clock, i shall conduct divine services at the house of this man per holm. everyone must be present--tell them that they have to come! and you, mother"--he turned to address kjersti--"i think it would be a kindness of you if you were to go over and help mrs. holm get the house ready for the service; it need not be anything extraordinary, but the pla

they gazed at the minister in alarm, but for a while said nothing.

"well--poor beret!" sighed kjersti, compassionately.

"beret? . . . so that is her name? what is the matter with the woman? are they so very poor?"

suddenly tönseten forgot his reserve and spoke up emphatically: "i'll tell you about it. this per hansa--that is to say, per holm--he has got rich out here; he has done better than anyone else, though he came here without a cent to his name. and why shouldn't he have done well? he has plenty of help in his

ade a big haul with his potatoes . . . why, he must have sold for a thousand that year, and nobody knows how much he has made these years on the fur trade that he's carried on with the indians. . . . he is now settled on three quarters of land!"

"well, well! that's fine! but what ails his wife?"

now it was kjersti's turn; she shook her head sadly as she related all the distressing circumstances. now and then tönseten, fearing that she hadn't made things clear enough, would put in a word. the minister prompted them with questions. after a while he had learned the whole sad story about beret holm. . . . his face clouded as he listened; it was as if the sun had suddenly darkened over a beautiful landscape, until it became drab and desolate to look upon. for a long time he stood there absorbed in thought, the two gazing at him apprehensively; they dared not speak to him in this mood. at last he said, quietly, "i think we had better arrange it this way, mother: i will go over there first, and yo

u follow about noontime. as for you, my friend," turning to tönseten, "try to do your errand well! remember that they must bring all the children requiring baptism. don't forget that! and tell them to be sure and bring their hymn books, too."

the minister was now making his preparations to go to per hansa's; as the distance was so short, he had decided to leave his horse.

tönseten fussed about uneasily, delaying his errand; he assured the minister that he needn't worry--he would get the message around to everybody in good season--it would only take a minute or two! . . . his red beard caught the sunlight every time he moved his head, which now kept bobbing around in a ridiculous way.

at last the minister took his departure and tönseten was on hand to go along with him.

"let me carry that satchel for you. . . . i'll begin here on the north side and work east--that's the shortest way."

they walked on side by side, the minister deeply a

bsorbed in thought; after a while tönseten fell a little way behind.

"i want to talk to you about something," he tried to say casually. his voice was so faint and low that the other could hardly catch it.

the minister stopped short and looked at him. tönseten glanced this way and that; his eyes fell to the ground and he made nervous dashes here and there, as if seeking escape. . . .

"well?" . . .

too late now! . . . tönseten took a deep breath, summoned all his courage, glanced once at the minister--then turned his head away. . . .

"i just wanted to ask you if . . . well . . . if it's possible to marry a couple who are already married? because in that case, i'd ask them to come, too."

"you mean, they a

 not! but maybe it wasn't done just right, you see, when the ceremony was performed. . . ."

"i am afraid i do not understand you."

tönseten spat out a huge mouthful of tobacco juice, and looked up into the sky.

"you see, it happened here," he confessed in a desperate voice, "that we had to organize the township; so we had to have officials, you see. well, they went ahead and elected me justice of the peace. . . . how could i help it, i'd like to know? . . . and then, you see, there wasn't a minister to be found in all dakota territory--there simply wasn't one in sight!" tönseten waved his hand with a wild gesture, still looking off into the sky.

the minister's face expanded into a broad smile.

"and so you had to serve as minister?"

"you've hit it--that's exactly what happened! . . . you see, this fellow, johannes mörstad, and his wife, they couldn't wait any longer--they should have been married long before, for that matter. and so they pounced upon me! . . . i refused point blank, of

 course . . . i have witnesses to that. but then, you see, i really was justice of the peace; and at last i had to give in. . . . that's the worst sin of all!" . . . tönseten could only whisper now.

"and so you married them?" said the minister, slowly.

"well, yes--i pitched in and did the best i could. . . . but now you've got to fix it up properly!" begged tönseten.

the minister's smile suddenly became a loud chuckle; tönseten listened incredulously; that chuckle descended on the anxious old fellow like a warm shower; it gave him courage to glance again at his companion. so great was his thankfulness that the feeling surged through him: for that man he could gladly die!

he spat and sputtered, blowing his nose in stentorian tones; but he could not take his eyes off the other man's face.

"was it long ago?"

"it will be four years this coming fall. . . . it was the thi

rinity, to be exact. i put a mark in my hymn book."

"you did what the law prescribed?"

"of course i did! . . . well, that is to say . . . i'm only an ignorant man . . ."

"are there any children?"

"children! don't talk about it! there are three of them already, with a fourth well on the way. as far as that part of it is concerned," tönseten observed in all seriousness, "everything seems to have been done properly enough! but . . . well, you'll just have to do it over again!"

"no," said the minister, still smiling, "that is your job, and i'll have nothing to do with it. but tell them to bring the children with them. . . . and now see that you get started!"

"but wasn't it a sacrilegious thing to do?"

"yes, under normal conditions--undoubtedly. but at the time, as you say, conditions were far from normal out here, and you had been duly elected to perform certain official duties. . . . the children of israel wandered about in the desert; at first they used the barren desert for their house

of worship, then came the tabernacle, finally the temple. and so with our people in this country. such marrying practices as some people have here are sacrilegious and must be discontinued . . . you're right in that."

"do you think the lord will ever forgive me?"

"that i truly believe he will! this probably is not the worst sin you have committed!"

tönseten's joy and relief were almost suffocating; he wiped his eyes as he gazed at the minister. . . . what a marvellously sensible man! . . .

"i'll hurry right off and tell them! . . . but, please, i beg of you, don't mention this at home. you see--well, kjersti is not very strong." . . .

and now tönseten was speeding along in great excitement from farm to farm, announcing to all the people that a pastor had come to them at last and that they must gather to hear him, he was such a wonderfully able man. and the farther and faster he went, the easier became the road and the more wonderf

ul did the minister grow in his mind, a fact which he emphasized at every place he came to and enlarged upon whenever he could stop long enough to draw breath. and he forgot neither the children nor the hymn books; he even found other items to bring to their attention. . . . all the while he was thinking: just imagine, even he could splice a couple together so that it was all right with the lord! well, well, that certainly was a most remarkable thing! . . .

the minister stood in the corner next to the window, arrayed in full canonicals. the gown was threadbare and badly wrinkled, as a result of its many journeys inside the old valise; the ruff might have been whiter, perhaps; but such trifles were not noticed now, for here stood a real norwegian minister in ruff and robe! . . . it was undoubtedly true, what tönseten had said about him--he was an altogether remarkable man. the vestments which he wore seemed only to emphasize the strength of his features, whose

 youthful vigour, in spite of the grey-streaked beard, appeared at this solemn moment to have taken on a new glow of life.

the table, spread with a white cloth, had been placed so close to the window that the minister barely had space to stand behind it; on the table stood two homemade candles, one at either end; the candlesticks, too, were homemade, cut from two four-inch pieces of sapling, with the bark left on and painted white; at a little distance they looked like curious works of art. the candles were not yet lighted; a bible and a hymn book lay between them.

ay the children all over the beds; on the big chest eight in all had taken their seats, running from big to little; the chest had been pulled out from the wall, so that people could sit on all four sides; the six rough benches which per hansa and hans olsa had hastily nailed together were now filled to capacity, mostly by women, young children, and older people who were not able to stay on their feet so long.

the beds stood in one corner of the room, the stove in another; in the third were the minister and the table; in the fourth, and on every available part of the floor, people were packed like sardines. as many as the room would actually hold had crowded in, eager to see the minister. but not all who had come could gain an entrance; quite a crowd had to remain outdoors: some stood along the walls; others had settled down on the grass. from those outside the house came the subdued sound of talk and laughter.

the women had dressed up in their best for the occasion, and most of the men, as w

 who had come straight from his work in the fields, his face covered with sweat and grime. . . .

in the dense cluster of people by the door some one cleared his throat loudly; another was heard to mutter that it was a good thing they didn't have to be particular about the floor! this latter remark caused a slight disturbance in the group; a voice laughed outright, and a couple of men tried to push the people ahead of them forward a little, so that they could clear a space to spit in. . . . the minister glanced up sharply, searching the crowd for the one who had spoken; the youthful look on his face changed to sternness as he rapped on the table:

"let us have silence, good people! we will begin at once." he raised his voice: "those who are outside must keep perfectly quiet!"

and now a deep silence descended on the closely packed room; through this silence the sound of quiet breathing rose and fell, gently yet perceptibly, like the rise and fall of a heavy ocean swell.

ening prayer. then he announced the hymn which they were to sing, and himself led the singing; a few joined in at first, one voice after another straggling along, like waves on a calm sea; but before the first stanza was ended every voice had picked up the tune and the room was vibrating to a surge of mighty song. after the hymn the minister chanted, conducting the full service just as if it had been in a real church. . . . how wonderful it seemed! . . . before long the men had to slip their coats off, it had grown so warm in the room.

the minister preached on the coming of the israelites into the land of canaan. he began by reminding his hearers of the dangers which the children of israel had been obliged to pass through, and of the struggles and tribulations which they had been forced to endure. he set forth what had been promis

 there, to indicate where they must have been! was it not significant that a whole people could disappear so completely? . . . how different the story of the two-tribe peoples! they, too, had been put in chains and treated as slaves; but they had been held in bonds of loyalty to their race and to him who had nurtured them; and they had endured and prospered. and so, at last, they had come back to rebuild the ruined walls of zion--and from their loins had sprung the saviour of mankind.

then the minister shifted the scene, applying the parable to those who stood before him; they, too, had wandered in search of a land of canaan; from the ancient home of their race they had fared forth, far away over the ocean into a foreign country; here they had settled now, here they proposed to strike root again; and here their seed would multiply from generation to generation, ages without end. true enough, they had no hostile nations to fight against--and for that they should thank the lord! yet there were

the minister was now spinning out his thoughts and holding them forth in the light for the people to see; he grew in greatness and power before their watching eyes, as he showed them their own feelings during the lonely hours. but when he even came to the grasshoppers at last, then tönseten could no longer restrain himself; he had to make manifest his approval in some way or other. with a firm hand he pushed against the back of the person in front of him, gaining the room to spit which he greatly needed; t

for now the minister was busy with their future. . . . did they fully understand what the lord had given them here--and were they sufficiently grateful to him for it? the minister towered high and mighty before them. . . . in what manner had they thought to make use of the unbounded liberty which the lord in his mercy had granted them? here they were about to build a new kingdom--themselves to lay the foundations, themselves to raise the whole structure from the ground up. had they begun to realize the greatness of that glorious responsibility which he had placed on their shoulders, and did they have sense enough in their heads to thank him for it on bended knee? . . . h

the words came with thrilling meaning; they took on a richer glow, a brighter texture, as the minister fired to his subject. . . . there was one point, he cried, where they and the ancient children of israel paralleled each other in a striking manner. for the kingdom which they were founding here would be a work of praise, a blessing to coming generations, only in so far as they remained steadfast to the truths implanted in them as children by their fathers. there was no other foundation to build upon; indeed, what other refuge did men have? . . . and now he stood here in their presence on this

the minister's voice had sunk low, but his words bore in upon them with irresistible power; his eyes glowed with a secret light; his cheeks burned with the flush of his inspiration; all his boyish youthfulness had gone, and in its place was speaking the authority of ripe, mature experience.

the people sat and stood about while he was preaching, hanging on every word he said. only a few were competent to climb the ladder of reasoning that he had raised for them. the others realized that he was preaching wel

in the farthest corner by the stove sat a pale, delicate-featured woman, almost hidden by those in front of her. as soon as the minister began to talk she bent her head forward and a little to one side, until she had found an opening through which she could get a glimpse of his face. she listened intently to the sermon--at first with a wondering, happy look, which slowly grew skeptical and sad; all the while her eyes did not release their hold on the speaker. as the sermon progressed, the expression on her face became covert and cunning; her lips moved as if she were making objections, but no sound came. . . .

when the hymn following the sermon had been sung, the minister said to them:

"now, it is my advice that those who have been sitting all this time, and have the strength to stand, change places with those who have been standing; in this way we may help to bear one another's burdens. let the change be made with order and decency. . . . we shall now perform the holy act of baptism. i should appreciate it if all you grown people would remain, and thus call to mind your own sacred covenant with the lord. . . . first let all unbaptized children come forward; an

then came three children who had been privately baptized by laymen. sörine advanced first, holding up for his second christening the child at whose birth she had been present and for whom she had once before stood sponsor; the boy awakened in the arms of his god-mother, turning two bright blue eyes toward the minister; he laughed aloud and asked sörine who that man was with the whiskers and the long black skirt? sörine tried by petting him to hush him up. . . . "he doesn't have any pants!" said the boy, still laughing and putting his arms around her neck; those who stood near enough to overhear were doubled up with mirth.

sh, striking terror into the hearts of the men who stood about, not knowing what to do; the women hid their faces and did not dare to look; some of the weaker-nerved began to weep hysterically; on one of the beds a little girl had thrown herself face downward, crying and screaming; two half-grown boys, overcome by the horror of it, silently pressed their cheeks against the sod wall; the doorway was now crowded with curious faces, one tier above another. all wanted to see what was going on.

the minister paused in the service.

"take your wife outside, peder holm! the air in here is close and bad for a sick person. i will talk to her afterward. . . . and the rest of you--please keep quiet!"

it took some time to calm the morbid excitement. per hansa had finally reached beret; he lifted her in his arms, but the people crowded around so densely that it was difficult to get through, and all the while beret was striking out wildly, pulling and pushing in a frantic effort to escape. she foamed at th

after the service the people remained standing around in groups out in the yard, talking about the minister and the sermon, and discussing in low tones the sad thing that had happened that day. the latter event claimed most of their attention. everyone felt great sympathy for this family on whom adversity had laid such a heavy hand; some thought it was very wrong for per hansa to keep a person like beret at home; a tragedy might happen at any time--and then it would be too late; various incidents of this kind were recalled; some remembered also that per hansa himself was a hard-hearted sinner who nee

ry for him, just the same.

none of the people of the house were to be seen. the crowd outside stood looking around, as if waiting for something to happen; no one wanted to leave until he knew. . . .

a few women were still inside the house; they had planned to stay and help put things in order. among them was sörine, still carrying the child in her arms. the women were plainly anxious and disturbed; they talked in subdued voices, and couldn't seem to take hold of the work with any heart.

the minister had seated himself at the table, folded his hands, and laid his head upon them; thus he sat for a long while in silence; then, as if noticing the people in the room for the first time, he got up and walked over to the group of women.

"i would suggest," he said, gently, "that you all go home. only let some one of you who is well acquainted here remain to help; if more are needed, we will send for you. . . . let me have that fine little boy awhile," he said to sörine. . . . "of course, i think

it would be better if you all came often to see her, but never more than one at a time. and never ask her how she is feeling; just take it for granted that everything is as it should be. to me, things do not look entirely hopeless here; i believe it will all come right in the end. yes, i truly believe it." . . . he took the boy on his knee, and began to play with him.

"god grant that it might happen as he says!" sighed kjersti.

the minister heard her.

"in his name, nothing is impossible! . . . now i should leave at once, if i were you. let the one who is best acquainted here, stay behind."

then the minister took the boy in his arms and went out into the yard; he approached each group standing there, talked to them quietly, and advised them to go home and keep to themselves as much as they could. . . . "for the word of god," he said, "is like seed put into the ground; it must be undisturbed, if it is to germinate and bear fruit;

but if it is too deeply covered, it will fail." . . .

"we were just talking about organizing a congregation, you see." the speaker looked in astonishment at the minister. could it be wrong to discuss that idea?

"the time for that will come later on, without a doubt." . . . the minister raised his voice. . . . "now i will ask each one of you kindly to go to his own home, remain quiet the rest of the day, and think about what you have heard."

"well, yes--that's probably all right, of course . . . but anyhow . . ."

the minister turned away and went to another group; the man had to quit talking and make the best of it. but he thought to himself: this must be a funny sort of minister who hasn't time to discuss such an important matter as organizing a congregation!

roup broke up and melted away; people moved slowly homeward, and soon there was no one left in the yard; the day had closed and night was fast coming on.

the minister remained outside for some time, walking about the yard, still clad in his canonical robe; the boy toddled along beside him, hanging on to the black gown as if it were a great joke, and thoroughly enjoying himself with this queer man.

at length the minister bent his steps toward the new sod stable, from which seemed to come the sound of voices and the whimpering cry of a child; he took up the boy in his arms, went over to the door, pushed it open, and stepped inside. the room had no windows; it was so dark in there that as he peered about, coming straight from the twilight, he could not make out the objects clearly. he was at once aware, however, of the presence of people; he walked farther in, looking around for what he knew was there.

the sound of his voice startled beret. she sat up, brushed her hair back, and looked around with a puzzled expression. she felt abashed, just like a modest person with too few clothes on who unexpectedly finds himself in the presence of others.

"oh, is this where we are?" she muttered, bending over and covering her eyes.

"i want something to eat!" cried the boy, tearing himself from the minister as soon as he heard his mother's voice.

she seized the child frantically and hugged him close to her; pushing her face down in the hollow of his neck, she drank and drank. . . .

"no, no, beret--don't be so violent!" begged her husband. "please be careful!"

then she threw back her head, the pale face flushed and distorted. "am i not to love my own child!"

the minister came up to her and laid his hand on her head.

"that's quite right, mother holm! love him all you can; but do not forget to t

hank him who has given you this precious gift. there is the promise of a splendid man in that fine boy; you will surely have much joy in him!"

beret ceased caressing the boy and sat bent over him, listening to the words of the minister. then she rose hurriedly and smoothed down her dress; again the minister got the impression that in some curious way she felt ashamed. without saying a word, she took a child by either hand and walked out of the stable.

per hansa remained sitting on the pile of hay, resting his head on one hand; his hair and beard were unkempt, and quite grizzled now; his face was deeply furrowed, as if by the marks of a ruthless hand; his whole figure seemed fearfully ravaged and broken, like a forest maple shattered by a storm.

the minister sat down beside him; he began to confe

tleness of a sympathetic and understanding pastor.

"now tell me everything. two can carry what one alone cannot lift. tell me everything from the beginning."

without changing his position, per hansa looked down at the hay, sighed, and began to talk in broken accents: "i don't understand it myself, you see. . . . i only know that damnation has come down upon us. . . . it can't continue much longer--i'll probably have to send her away." again he sighed, and then became silent.

it seemed to the minister as if the sum total of human tragedy sat talking to him. . . . a chill had entered the dimly lighted room.

"perhaps you are right . . . otherwise, the cross might become too heavy for you to bear!"

a long pause fell.

"but she is not entirely deranged, is she?"

"partly or entirely--what difference does it make? if the fiddle is cracked, it's cracked. . . ."

"maybe so . . . yes, yes. . . ."

still looking down at the hay, per hansa continued:

"i don't know that i am guilty of any other wron

g toward her than that our oldest boy came before we were married; but in that matter we were equally to blame. . . . and then i brought her out here. i suppose that there is where the real trouble lies. . . . i don't believe she grieves much about that other affair. . . . no, it's this business out here--and for the life of me i can't see any sin in it."

"i think i understand," said the minister, gently.

"but is a man to refuse to go where his whole future calls, only because his wife doesn't like it?" . . . the question sprang out of per hansa's soul, as if he were for the first time opening the door to many years of pent-up suffering. he turned his strong, resolute face toward the minister, begging for an answer.

"indeed he may, my good man," said the minister, earnestly. "but it would be better if they were both agreed upon it."

"agreed, yes--easy enough to say! . . . when the on

ly disagreement, for instance, was that she advised waiting another year! . . . and it isn't so much what she has said since we came out here. . . . now, i wish you would tell me--" per hansa spoke softly, almost diffidently. "suppose a husband and wife cannot agree--what, then, is he to do?"

the minister felt through the question the aching need of the man for relief and comfort.

"therefore shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh," he quoted. "there you have the lord's decree. but if the law applies to man, it must apply to woman as well. between you two there has, as i understand it, been no real disagreement?"

per hansa shook his head; the words came with great difficulty:

"i sometimes wonder if there ever were two people

who cared quite as much for each other as we do. . . . but that hasn't made things any easier; you can't lift the ocean, whether it rages in a storm or lies quiet in a flat calm. . . . and now, please tell me, you who are a minister and understand the scriptures, what is the man to do?" per hansa grasped the minister by the arm, clutching hard in his terrible agitation.

"he shall humble himself before the lord his god, and shall take up his cross to bear it with patience!" said the minister, impressively.

"ha-ha!" per hansa suddenly burst out in a bitter laugh. "that's too scanty a fare for me to live on. you'd better put that kind of talk aside. . . . i ask as an ignorant man, and i must have an answer that i can understand: did i do right or did i do wrong when i brought her out here? and what should i have done instead, when i saw nothing else ahead of me in the world?"

"that time you undoubtedly did right, my good man, if what you have told me is true; a man must go whither

"no, i am not; and let me tell you something more." per hansa's voice hardened. "we find other things to do out here than to carry crosses!" then he fell silent. the minister tried to find words with which to reprove him; but in a moment per hansa began again--and now it was he who rebuked the minister: "my experience has been that it is mighty easy for one to talk about things he has not tried! . . . i have sweat blood over this thing--and now i'm no longer equal to it. . . . have you ever thought what it means for a man to be in constant fear that the mother may do away with her own children--and that, besides, it may be his fault that she has fallen into that sta

te of mind?"

when the minister finally answered, he had become all gentleness again. "no, thanks and praise to god, such affliction he has spared me!" he put one arm over per hansa's shoulder. "tell me how all this came about."

per hansa sat for a while without answering; he seemed like a man trying to climb a steep hill, whose strength has given out; all at once he got up and went over to the door, standing there and looking out a long time into the darkness of the night. the minister followed him. . . .

"there isn't much to say about such things," per hansa began. "she has never felt at home here in america. . . . there are some people, i know now, who never should emigrate, because, you see, they can't take pleasure in that which is to come--they simply can't see it! . . . and yet, she has never reproached me. and in spite of everything, we got along fairly well up to the time when our last child was born. . . . yes, the one you baptized to-day. . . . then she took a noti

"of course i mean it! it is the handsomest name i can ever remember giving to any child. peder victorious--why, it sings like a beautiful melody!"

"please tell me--is it really a human name? and wasn't it a sacrilege on my part?" asked per hansa, incredulously, hardly daring yet to acknowledge his joy.

"my dear man, have you worried about that, too?"

"have i? . . . don't mention it! . . . you mean that the name is all right?"

"yes, indeed," said the minister without hesitation. "there is nothing unusual about it, except that you have happened to find a more beautiful form than i have yet heard; the name itself is common in all languages."

per hansa gazed at the minister, bringing his face close up in order to see him better in the growing dusk of the evening. slowly his eyes began to light with a new courage; he took a deep breath, and straightened his body up for the first time in many a long day.

"i must ask you again, for i am an ignorant man:

een in her mind i cannot say. i forgot to tell you," he went on, controlling himself once more, "that the very night before, her mother was in the room with her; beret talked with her just as plainly as i now stand here talking to you. she had got up and dressed herself, and was telling her mother all about everything, the way women do . . . and, would you believe it, she wanted to cook coffee for her! . . . 'we aren't so poor as all that!' she told her mother."

"and how was it afterward?" the minister asked, deeply moved.

"well, you see," said per hansa, wiping his eyes, "i had to do something about it. so i persuaded her to let sörrina take the child during the summer."

"you got her to agree to that?"

"yes, after a while; at first she wouldn't hear of it, but finally she gave in. and now i don't know whether i did right or wrong; i believe it hurt her terribly to have the little fellow gone. i saw how she wandered about the room, as if longing to care and do for him, but he was not ther

t that anything was wrong with her during this time; she does her work like all the rest of us. in the dead of winter, of course, when the blizzards are raging and we don't see any other folks for weeks at a time, she has days when she seems to go all to pieces; but i hardly reckon that as the disease--that sort of thing happens to a good many of us, let me tell you!"

"what do you intend to do about it this summer?"

"this summer?" . . . per hansa's face was drawn with fear as he turned to the minister. . . . "if satan lets his hosts loose upon us again this summer, then i don't know what will happen!"

the minister patted him on the shoulder:

"take no thought for the morrow! the plague cannot last forever. and remember that the lord is always near. as the number of thy days, so shall thy strength be. and now take this advice from me: from now on keep close to her; be toward her as you were during those happy days when you first got her, let your affection warm her into the understanding tha

the minister gazed before him in deep thought, his heart wrung with pity and compassion. "perhaps the lord will allow me to reach her mind with a clarifying idea. his word is living life and can move mountains. . . . when i return you must take her to communion."

his hand was patting the shoulder on which it rested. per hansa wept, his sobs coming in short gasps that shook his frame; he experienced a blessing descending upon him, and his burden grew lighter. there was much more he wanted to say, but just n

ow he could not speak. . . .

a long pause followed; then the minister spoke again: "let us not stand here longer in fear and darkness, talking about sad things; our bodies need nourishment."

they walked across the yard in the quiet prairie evening, per hansa so happy that he could gladly have offered the minister his whole crop as it stood in all its beauty . . . and he had a hundred acres seeded in, counting it near and far.

just as they reached the door of the hut somebody rounded the corner on the run and called in a quick, scared voice, "father!"

both men jumped, so suddenly had the figure come out of the darkness.

"is that you, ola? what are you up to, anyway?"

"father, come here!" the boy grasped per hansa by the arm and tried to pull him along. "hans is sitting up on the indian mound, crying

"is he sick?"

"no!"

"what's the matter with him, then?" the father shook the boy.

"he is afraid of mother . . . you must come right away!"

the boy sped away into the darkness.

per hansa gave the minister a look which seemed to say: "now you see how things are here!" . . . and all the radiance that for a moment had lighted up his soul was suddenly gone out. he asked the minister to enter. . . . "tell them that i and the boys will be right along." . . . then he too disappeared.

the minister stood there for a while in deep uncertainty; at last he turned toward the door, made the sign of the cross in front of it, said a prayer, then opened it and went in.

"now wipe your face--we can't come into the house this way." . . . the father began to dry the boy's tear-stained face.

nothing out of the ordinary happened that evening. when the minister came into the hut he greeted them in an even voice, "god's peace upon this house!" then he took off his vestments, folded them up and put them in his valise, looked around for a chair, and sat down. and now that he had removed his official garb he looked like a different man; the special odour of sanctity that had rested on him seemed to have departed; he sat there quietly, having little to say, looking like a man who has just passed through a great hardship and is very tired. . . . the table w

 and another stood on a little shelf by the stove. sörine was still in the house, bustling about and helping with the meal; and-ongen sat on one of the beds, playing with her baby brother, who had been washed and dressed for the night and was now ready to be put to sleep. sörine kept talking and laughing with the children as she worked, and an air of cheerfulness had come over the room.

beret stood by the stove, bent over, washing some pots and pans; she glanced once over her shoulder at the minister as he sat down; but very soon she had to look again. and then she did something that she often wondered at afterward: she wiped her hands, took a clean bowl from the cupboard, filled it with fresh milk, and offered it to him, saying: "have some milk, please, to stay your hunger while you wait."

the minister took the bowl without looking at her, he emptied it at one draught, put it down, and thanked her in a few brief words.

almost immediately beret grew bashful and uneasy over what she had do

ne; in her nervousness she picked up a shirt that she was making for one of the boys, sat down by the candlelight near the stove, and began to sew as hard as she could; but she kept her face turned away from the minister.

per hansa and the boys came in; sörine announced that supper was ready; the four men sat down and began the meal. the minister looked at the younger boy; his face was swollen, his eyes were red with weeping; a heavy veil seemed to hide his handsome features. at the sight of the boy the minister felt more like crying than eating; a sudden revulsion overcame him. laying down his knife and fork, he asked for another bowl of milk, which he emptied slowly, and then waited for the others to get through. when he thought they had finished, he folded his hands on the table and began to pray to the unseen one whose presence was

always near.

so quickly did he begin, that at first per hansa didn't realize what was going on and was on the point of asking the minister what he said. the same thing happened to the others: ole had just discovered that he wasn't quite satisfied, and was reaching for another piece of bread; sörine was about to offer them all more coffee. but beret sat bowed over her sewing, trying to catch every word; she took a few stitches, and then the work dropped to her lap; something compelled her to turn and look at him. the light of the candle cast a reddish gleam over his face; his beard seemed more silvery than ever; the countenance wa

thus was the splendour which now pervaded per hansa's sod house. all had folded their hands without knowing it. over on the bed the play continued; happy laughter arose, though it did not seem to disturb the prayer. but after a while that also quieted down. . . . then permand heard the voice of the one he had been playing with earlier in the evening; it tempted him so hard that he could not resist; clad in his little nightdress, he crawled out of the bed, toddled across the earthen floor to the minister, put both hands on the knees that rose before him, and looked up merrily into the man's face. all who saw it felt shocked at the impropriety; they wanted to stop the child, but only feared a greater impropriety in anything they might do. per hansa was on the point of speaking sharply, but his voice failed; sörine thought of snatching the child away, but only remained motionless and aghast. . . . "i suppose i shall have to do it myself," thought beret--yet she, too, could not get up from her ch

air. . . . the child had entered a glory where no one dared to follow. . . . without interrupting his flow of words, the minister lifted the boy onto his knees, folded the baby hands within his own, and went on with the prayer. . . . "oh, this is too bad!" cried beret to herself, straggling to rise. "the child's nightshirt is dirty--he mustn't sit there!" but still she could not get up from her chair: the one with whom the minister was talking stood too near. . . . the words flowed on without a pause, softly and sweetly, like the warm rain of a summer evening. it was as if the minister had much to confide to that other one; the other one seemed to be objecting, as if he hesitated to do what was asked; then the minister prayed more fervently; not that he raised his voice--the words came with the same gentleness--but he threw his whole soul into them, as if he refused on any account to give in.

at last he came to the littl

st on this house, for ever and ever . . . amen!" . . .

he sat with closed eyes for some time, his hand still resting on the boy's head; the others were very still. beret trembled throughout her body; a choking feeling came over her, and at last she had to cough. she glanced down in confusion at her sewing.

"i haven't done this right!" she thought, distractedly, trying to calm herself. she looked at the sewing again, got up to fetch the shears, and ripped out what she had been doing.

then the minister began to play with the boy, in a natural, happy way; and in a little while they both seemed to be having great fun. but he didn't have anything to say to the others; and they, in turn, couldn't find anything to say to him.

but the next morning, as they sat at the breakfast table, the minister was both merry and talkative, and helped himself so liberally to the food that it was a pleasure just to see him do it. he asked many questions regarding the life and conditions in that vicinity, and show

ed himself so well informed about farming that per hansa asked, without thinking, whether he had ever been a farmer. . . . then he suddenly remembered what the minister had told him to do the evening before; he got up hastily, called to the boys, and they left the house together.

the moment they were gone beret grew very uneasy; she found her sewing again, and sat down with it in a furtive, embarrassed way. the minister could see nothing unusual about her, except that her face was so singularly childlike; this impression came mostly from the way she used her eyes; it was hard to find them, because she kept looking down in extreme bashfulness and timidity; nor could he seem to easily draw her into conversation.

he came over and stood beside her chair.

"well, now, mrs. holm, i have a request to make of you. two weeks from next sunday i shall return; and then i plan to conduct communion services here in your ho

s, right here in your house, where you live every day. . . . don't you think it would be a blessing for you to come to the lord with your sins and taste the sweetness of his mercy?" he said in a quiet voice.

"here . . . ?" she asked, greatly agitated. "oh no--that would never do--oh no! . . . it's too filthy and dirty here. . . . there's too much . . . it's unclean!" . . . she stopped abruptly, blushed scarlet, and looked down into her lap again.

"no doubt there is much sin here," resumed the minister. "that i am sure of. but the lord will sanctify the house for us. . . . and now i want you to plan how nicely we can arrange it for his blessed purposes. let us consider the matter before i leave." he looked around the room. "the table had better be taken out--that will give us more room. that big chest we can perhaps use as the altar--that is, if your husband could fix up something for railing. we could probably find some fitting material to cover both that and the chest; perhaps you had bette

r talk to the neighbour women about it." . . . the minister talked on as if everything were decided, with only the responsibility for its execution left in her hands.

she gave him a quick look; her cheeks were flushed.

"that is my father's chest . . . it is a nice chest, too."

the voice had grown querulous again and bore the same childlike expression; the minister made no reply. he took her hand, thanked her briefly for her hospitality, and hurried out of the room. when he got outside his forehead was damp with perspiration. he saw per hansa coming in his direction, but turned away to avoid him. . . .

when beret sat down awhile later to dress the little boy she felt that she could sing aloud to-day--felt that she had to sing, that she could not help it. both words and melody seemed to rise in her throat; it was the baptismal hymn that they had used the

that summer a number of houses went up to the westward of spring creek. before the minister had come the first time, hans olsa had already hauled the materials for both dwelling and barn; now he was building. after the first year he had gone into stock raising; he had the largest herd in the settlement, and was doing very well--for those days. . . . and tönseten, after receiving absolution for his great sin, had become all aglow with high ambitions; his prospects were bright of being elected klokker--perhaps deacon, too; life for him was positively glorious, just one grand song. all

ns no one would have gathered that they were on their way to church.

old aslak tjöme, who lived just northwest of sam solum, brought his wife in a wheelbarrow. she had fractured her hip on the ice that spring and was still unable to walk. . . . "god only knows when she's going to get well again!" said aslak. "it's too bad, because even when she is well i have no more help than i need." . . . and aslak was bringing his wife to church for this reason: he had a notion--just a notion--that if the minister would lay his hands on her she might gain faster. . . . anyhow, there was no harm in trying. . . . aslak, with his wife in the wheelbarrow, made a funny sight; he had rigged up a high back-rest for her and had fixed a seat in the barrow, covered with a sheepskin rug; on this she sat like a queen on her throne. on either side of the wheelbarrow he had fastened short poles, connecting them with a rope. the woman clung to the rope with one hand; in the other she held a hymn book wrapped in a white

 handkerchief.

folks passing them stopped and laughed, and offered to push awhile. "oh no, thank you!" said aslak, merrily. "now i can manage her alone, but it hasn't always been thus--no, indeed!" then he laughed again as he pushed on, and looked lovingly at her. she nodded and smiled, laughing back at him. . . . "you take my place and let me push awhile!" . . . that gave them a good laugh together.

the minister had reached the settlement the evening before and had stayed overnight at per hansa's. that morning they had been up early, had hurried through the breakfast, and immediately after had started to put the house in order for the service. it had been thoroughly cleaned and tidied up before he came. all kinds of wild flowers that were to be found on the prairie had been gathered and hung in bouquets of various sizes under the ceiling, or put into glasses and bowls that stood around in every conceiv

able place. there was something strange and haphazard about it, as if it had been done by children in play. . . . as the minister looked around, a chill hand seemed to clutch his heart. . . .

the table had been carried outside and the big chest placed diagonally in one corner, just as he had directed on his first visit. per hansa had constructed a long, low bench, made up of several small benches; this ran along in front of the chest and was covered with two rugs that sörine had brought over; the chest itself was draped with a white cloth. the minister took the paten and the chalice and placed them on the improvised alt

ar; he also asked for the two candlesticks he had noticed the other time, and when they had been brought and fitted with candles, he set them on either end of the chest. over the cold stove they spread another rug; yesterday the boys had stripped off a whole tubful of willow leaves; these were now brought in and scattered around on the floor.

the result was satisfactory. the minister looked around; he had scarcely spoken since he came. . . . "now i am going over to the other hut to dress for the service; i shall be there until it is time to begin, and would rather not be disturbed." . . . he glanced at the wife, then at the husband, and said as he went out, "god grant to both of you a blessed communion!"

entering the other hut, where he had slept the previous night, the minister slowly began to put on his canonicals. his lips moved in prayer; his brow was wet with perspira

and when he sought it he sought in vain! . . .

. . . in him the faith was lacking; of that he was painfully aware.

with a supreme effort he got up from the bed and went out into the yard.

when he reached the other house it was packed full of people; the elders had found places in the front of the room; there also sat aslak tjöme with his wife, the invalid woman comfortably propped up at his side; per hansa and his wife sat on the very first bench, right in front of the improvised altar. the minister scanned the crowd, paused for a moment, then came forward and spoke calmly to per hansa: "now, when the service begins, you two will please come forward first. as soon as you have received communion, you had better go outside, for it will be hot and stuffy in here." then he went from person to person, writing down the names of the communicants; at once a deep silence fell on the room.

as the text for the communion sermon the minister had chosen the glory of the lord; rather, he had not chosen

"what was it that the little band of disciples experienced when they sat at table with him and he himself brake the bread for them and handed them the cup?"

the minister paused, wiping the perspiration from his face. every time he drew one of these word pictures for them, the idea came to him more and more forcibly: "these people, sitting here in front of me, are sognings and vossings; the man of the house and his wife are fisher-folk from nordland. . . . how can they understand the things that happened to an alien people, living ages ago, in a distant land? the israelites were an oriental race; they didn't know anything about dakota territory, either; they had

 about looking for something while he talks aloud to himself. his eyes roamed helplessly over the rows of faces; they fixed on a fly buzzing around the room, and followed it while he talked. a little way off sat a young woman with three small children; she was a fine, bright-looking woman, tanned and burned by the sun; that must be the girl that tönseten had married, he thought. the oldest child leaned up against her, the second lay with his head on her thigh; he seemed to be sleeping, for the minister saw only the curly head. she had the youngest child in her lap. he had been restless for a long time, and the mother had unbuttoned her clothes to nurse him. the fly buzzed and buzzed, made a turn in the air, and settled on the nose of the nursing child; the mother raised her hand and swept it away, and as she did so she drew the hand caressingly over the face of the child.

the minister kept on looking at the group. . . . he had talked himself into complete bankruptcy respecting all things gre

so she had prepared herself in her own way. around her waist was wound a long rope; this she now unrolled, tying all nine children to it in single file, but keeping the end still securely fastened around her waist. in this fashion kari plodded through the streets of the great city, a laughingstock to all passers-by. but just the same, she reached her destination at last, with all her nine children safe and sound! . . . wasn't that rope a fine illustration of a mother's love?

it occurred to the minister that he had come down to very commonplace things--yet he spoke straight out, from the fullness of his heart. . . . the people were listening intently; the woman with three little children stopped chasing the fly; he longed to tell her to go on with her duties and not mind him. . . . but all at once she seemed to become his own mother, as plainly as if he had seen her in the flesh; and he remembered how she had struggled and suffered as a pioneer woman, first in illinois, afterward in minnesota.

the minister ended his sermon, looked at his watch, and his brows knit in a puzzled frown. how had this happened? according to the watch, he had been speaking for an hour and fifteen minutes. could it be possible?

the people came forward, knelt down before per hansa's big chest, and received an assurance so gracious and benign that they could hardly credit its reality. . . . many eyes filled with tears during that hour. . . .

the absolution took a long time. the minister looked again at his watch; he stil

he refused to stop for dinner; having hastily drunk a bowl of milk, he got into his cart at once and drove off. . . . the cart shook and rattled; the old nag ambled along; the minister sat immersed in a deep gloom. . . . "never before," he thought, "have i failed so miserably in any service!"

it rained both monday and tuesday, but not so hard that hans olsa had to stop building. with two carpenters to help him, he made such good progress that the day was gone even before it had begun--or so it seemed to him. which was hardly to be wondered at, because from morning till night could be heard rumbling out of the caverns of his bulky chest a continuous monotone that

 mansion for him who was coming. . . . how marvellous it all was! . . . hans olsa was both a sensible and a serious-minded man; but he would gladly have built two more rooms if she had asked for them, just to show his gratitude. . . .

he had been present at the service last sunday, had taken part in the communion; and the longer the service had lasted the stronger and deeper had grown his felicity. he was only a common, uneducated man, and probably lacked a proper conception of the wonders the minister preached about; yet this he knew for certain, that nothing so glorious as that communion service in per hansa's sod house had he ever before experienced, and the happiness of that hour was still glowing with steady warmth in hans olsa's heart. . . . as per hansa and beret had knelt before the chest, he had looked at them, thinking of many things. beret's sad condition could easily be seen in her face. ah no, when reason once leaves a person, it seldom returns! . . . and per hansa himself had be

 for the boys, who were hoeing the potatoes. per hansa was repairing the roof of the new barn. it had been leaking there since the frost went out of the ground last spring, because the willow poles used for supports had not been heavy enough. she could not see him from where she sat, but she could hear him working.

"yes," she sighed, looking up from her sewing, "he can manage his work all right. i only wish i could do mine as well." . . . her face carried the same childlike expression that the minister had noticed, her eyes had the same dreamy, far-away stare; they seemed to be seeing something she did not want to behold, looking for something that would never happen; hence the strange sadness that always shone through them.

she felt perfectly happy, however, but felt so tired and drowsy; it had been this way every day now since that remarkable man had placed his hand on her and in his prophetic voice had assured her that from this time forth she was released from the bonds of satan. . . . t

ow, snatches of the song came back to her again, and she began humming. . . . no, no--this would never do! she might scare some one again--people seemed so easily frightened here. . . . this had turned out to be a rather hard piece of sewing, but the child was going to look fine in his new shirt . . . would she be able to hear him in the other hut when he woke up? . . . well, he had a pretty good voice! . . .

. . . surely, now, mother will stop asking for him when she hears he is going to be a minister! . . . the smile on her child-like face broadened and lighted up. . . . a minister in the family--i, the mother of a servant of god--why, that is exactly as it is in the bible! . . . her hands trembled as stitch followed stitch. but thoughts were crowding rapidly on her now; she laid down her sewing.

"well," she'll ask, "are you sure now, beret, that he is going to be a minister? don't draw hasty conclusions--you've always been so impulsive!" that's exactly what she'll say. . . . then i must answer: "yes, mother, you needn't doubt it any longer; for i myself sat here and heard how this wonderful man argued about it with the lord--and how he got his way, too. and both per hansa and sörine heard it also. you can ask them if you don't believe me." . . . then mother will look at me in her kind way, for a long, long time. at last she'll say: "well, if god can use him, it c

. . . "i certainly ought to know beret," remarked the other voice, thoughtfully. "we were playmates, she and i." . . .

. . . "i doubt that very much," interrupted per hansa, "though you are an observing man. i have lived with her all these years, yet i must confess that i don't know her. . . . she is a better soul than any i've ever met. it's only lately that i have begun to realize all she has suffered since we came out here. the minister was probably right; no one can ever fathom the depths of a mother's heart. . . . the urge within me drove me on and on, and never would i stop; for i reasoned like this, that where i found happiness others must find it as well. . . . but you see how things have turned out! . . . the finest castle on earth i was going to build her--and here we're still living in a mole's hole--all my dreams have been crushed in misery. . . . but this i've decided, that she shall keep the baby--though i thank you

 take care of things here." . . .

she went into the bedroom again, to see if she could do anything for the sick man. he was awake when she came in; his manner showed that he had been waiting for her.

"how is the weather outside?" he asked, slowly. "would it be possible for a man to travel in it?"

"what do you say?" she came close to the bed.

"could we try to get the doctor, do you suppose? . . . others out here have had him." . . .

"we shall see when daylight comes. . . . but how about the minister, hans olsa?"

"the minister?"

"yes--when the lord's hour is at hand, man's help is of no avail; for from his wrath no man can flee! . . . what you need most of all is communion, hans olsa!"

"communion . . . ? well . . . yes . . . i suppose so . . . that is true."

"it is terrible to fall into the hands of the living god," said beret, quietly, and looked into his face with sorrowful despair. "there is nothing but evil in us--yes, nothing! but when he comes to us in holy communion, laying his m

s hands fidgeting with the covers; then he repeated in a low voice: "so--is it as deep as that?"

"was there something on your mind?"

"then it isn't possible to get anywhere!" . . . the powerful jaws closed; drops of sweat stood out on the great, shiny face.

per hansa's heart stirred with a nameless dread; he felt himself grow dizzy, but he cleared his throat and said, firmly:

"what is it that you want, hans olsa? . . . do you want the doctor?"

the sick man turned toward him.

"oh--it's the minister i need!" . . . then, after a moment, he added: "but don't you think the weather will be better in a day or two?" . . .

he lay perfectly still. when he got no answer he looked up and repeated, imploringly:

"don't you think so?"

per hansa rose to his feet and began pacing back and forth across the floor. it must be very close in here . . . he felt so faint. thinking of how it was outdoors, he suddenly found himself bathed in perspiration. . . . god pity him who had to travel the prairie these

, and he seemed engrossed in his own thoughts. he ate slowly and took a long time over the meal; all the while he kept looking out of the window.

at length he got up from the table, crossed to the stove, turned his back to it, and put his hands behind him, as though he still felt cold and needed the warmth of the fire. . . . "well," he said, meditatively, "i suppose he doesn't expect to get over this sickness--and it's more than likely he won't. he just lies there and whimpers about having the minister. . . . there's something uncanny about him. i can't understand it at all." . . . these remarks were not directed at beret; he stood looking straight ahead of him, as if thinking aloud. beret had stopped working when she heard him; her face lighted up as she answered, with an unmistakable ring of exultation in her voice: "but i can understand it! . . . now may god be near and hear his prayer! some one must go for the minister at once."

per hansa did not move; he was staring off into space. bere

 can't you understand that a human being ever becomes concerned over his sins and wants to be freed from them?"

"i suppose i don't understand anything, do i?" said per hansa in a tone of disgust. "perhaps i don't understand, for instance--though god knows it would not be difficult for any grown person to see it--that no man could cross the prairie from here to the james river, as things are now, and come out alive--. . . as for hans olsa, the lord will find him good enough, even without either minister or klokker--that i truly believe!"

"the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not! . . . here lies one who is about to receive his sight, and we will not reach out a hand to help him!"

"hold your tongue, beret!" cried per hansa, sharply, anger at the hopelessness of the argument getting the better of him. "do you want to drive me out into the jaws of death?"

"what horrible things you say, per hansa!"

"horrible--well! don't you suppose the good lord would have provid

in! the sweet desires of the flesh are the nets of satan. . . . how deeply sin has besoiled all life! . . . beret went about her work with a greater determination; but her sad mood did not lift.

a hundred things were waiting for per hansa outside, but he was so angry that he scarcely noticed what he was about. . . . the world seemed upside down to-day. . . . that grown people couldn't see an inch beyond their noses! here lay hans olsa, driving himself out of his mind because he couldn't have a minister--when there was no better man than himself in all christendom! . . . and here was beret insisting that he leap right into the arms of death--she who had a heart so tender that she couldn't harm a mouse! . . . people could certainly twist things around in a queer way! all his life he had worked and slaved in order that she and the children might be made comfortable . . . and now it was flung in his face and he was taunted with being only a blind mole who saw nothing but the hole he had burrowed

 concluded at once that she must have left home in a hurry, and feared that the worst had happened. . . . was anything wrong? he asked. . . . no, hans olsa didn't seem much worse; she thought he looked a little better. but her face was sad and she looked down as she spoke. . . . bridget had been to see him again and had said there was no hope. . . . "and i guess there isn't, either," she went on. "but i had to come over and ask your advice, per hansa. . . . he said that you were going after the minister for him. and i suppose that might be a good thing to do; at any rate, he is very happy about it. . . . but now, of course, i see that it's impossible to go anywhere. . . . still, i was thinking that if you did intend to try, it might be better to get the doctor instead. . . . i don't suppose you can think of it in this weather, but i had to come over, anyway. . . ." not once did she look up as the obvious pleading went on.
