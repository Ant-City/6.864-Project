to set the crowne once more on henries head,

but to preuent the tyrants violence,

ile hence forthwith vnto the sanctuary,
to saue (at least) the heire of edwards right:
there shall i rest secure from force and fraud:
come therefore let vs flye, while we may flye,
if warwicke take vs, we are sure to dye.

nay, be thou sure, ile well requite thy kindnesse.
for that it made my imprisonment, a pleasure:
i, such a pleasure, as incaged birds
conceiue; when after many moody thoughts,
at last, by notes of houshold harmonie,
they quite forget their losse of libertie.
but warwicke, after god, thou set'st me free,
and chiefely therefore, i thanke god, and thee,
he was the author, thou the instrument.
therefore that i may conquer fortunes spight,
by liuing low, where fortune cannot hurt me,
and that the people of this blessed land
may not be punisht with my thwarting starres,
warwicke, although my head still weare the crowne,
i here resigne my gouernment to thee,
for thou art fortunate in all thy deeds
