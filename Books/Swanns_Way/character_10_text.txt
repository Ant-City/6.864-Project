swann in love

to admit you to the 'little nucleus,' the 'little group,' the 'little
clan' at the verdurins', one condition sufficed, but that one was
indispensable; you must give tacit adherence to a creed one of whose
articles was that the young pianist, whom mme. verdurin had taken under
her patronage that year, and of whom she said "really, it oughtn't to
be allowed, to play wagner as well as that!" left both planté
and rubinstein 'sitting'; while dr. cottard was a more brilliant
diagnostician than potain. each 'new recruit' whom the verdurins failed
to persuade that the evenings spent by other

people, in other houses
than theirs, were as dull as ditch-water, saw himself banished
forthwith. women being in this respect more rebellious than men, more
reluctant to lay aside all worldly curiosity and the desire to find out
for themselves whether other drawing-rooms might not sometimes be as
entertaining, and the verdurins feeling, moreover, that this critical
spirit and this demon of frivolity might, by their contagion, prove
fatal to the orthodoxy of the little church, they had been obliged to
expel, one after another, all those of the 'faithful' who were of the
female sex.

apart from the doctor's young wife, they were reduced almost exclusively
that season (for all that mme. verdurin herself was a thoroughly 'good'
woman, and came of a respectable middle-class family, excessively rich
and wholly undistinguish

at one period, 'answered the bell': ladies
quite ignorant of the world, who in their social simplicity were so
easily led to believe that the princesse de sagan and the duchesse
de guermantes were obliged to pay large sums of money to other poor
wretches, in order to have anyone at their dinner-parties, that if
somebody had offered to procure them an invitation to the house of
either of those great dames, the old doorkeeper and the woman of 'easy
virtue' would have contemptuously declined.

the verdurins never invited you to dinner; you had your 'place laid'
there. there was never any programme for the evening's entertainment.
the young pianist would play, but only if he felt inclined, for no one
was forced to do anything, and, as m. verdurin used to say: "we're all
friends here. liberty hall, you know!"

if the pianist suggested playing the ride of the valkyries, or the
prelude to tristan, mme. verdurin would protest, not that the music was
displeasing to her, but, on the contrary, that it mad

"i shall come on good friday--to say good-bye to you, for we are going
to spend the holidays in auvergne."

"in auvergne? to be eaten by fleas and all sorts of creatures! a fine
lot of good that will do you!" and after a solemn pause: "if you had
only told us, we would have tried to get up a party, and all gone there
together, comfortably."

and so, too, if one of the 'faithful' had a friend, or one of the ladies
a young man, who was liable, now and then, to make them miss an evening,
the verdurins, who were not in the least afraid of a woman's having a
lover, provided that she had him in their company, loved him in their
company and did not prefer him to their company, would say: "very well,
then, bring your friend along." and he would be put to the test, to see
whether he was willing to have no secrets from mme. verdurin, whether he
was susceptible of being enrolled in the 'little clan.' if he failed
to pass, the faithful one who had introduced him would be taken on one
side, and would

that you are a piece of perfection."

"just as you like," replied odette, in an affected tone, and then went
on: "you know i'm not fishing for compliments."

"very well; bring your friend, if he's nice."

now there was no connection whatsoever between the 'little nucleus' and
the society which swann frequented, and a purely worldly man would
have thought it hardly worth his while, when occupying so exceptional
a position in the world, to seek an introduction to the verdurins. but
swann was so ardent a lover that, once he had got to know almost all the
women of the aristocracy, once they had taught him all that there was
to learn, he had ceased to regard those naturalisation papers, almost a
patent of nobility, which the faubourg saint-germain had bestowed upon
him, save as a sort of negotiable bond, a letter of credit with no
intrinsic value, which allowed him to improvise a status for himself in
some little hole in the country, or in some obscure quarter of paris,

ose dreams
the memory of her could no longer be eliminated, then her bodily
imperfections would no longer be of the least importance, nor would the
conformity of her body, more or less than any other, to the requirements
of swann's taste; since, having become the body of her whom he loved, it
must henceforth be the only one capable of causing him joy or anguish.

it so happened that my grandfather had known--which was more than could
be said of any other actual acquaintance--the family of these verdurins.
but he had entirely severed his connection with what he called "young
verdurin," taking a general view of him as one who had fallen--though
without losing hold of his millions--among the riff-raff of bohemia. one
day he received a letter from swann asking whether my grandfather could
put him in touch with the verdurins. "on guard! on guard!" he exclaimed
as he read it, "i am not at all surprised; swann was bound to finish up
like this. a nice lot of people! i cannot do what he asks, because, i

the first place, i no longer know the gentleman in question. besides,
there must be a woman in it somewhere, and i don't mix myself up in such
matters. ah, well, we shall see some fun if swann begins running after
the little verdurins."

and on my grandfather's refusal to act as sponsor, it was odette herself
who had taken swann to the house.

the verdurins had had dining with them, on the day when swann made his
first appearance, dr. and mme. cottard, the young pianist and his aunt,
and the painter then in favour, while these were joined, in the course
of the evening, by several more of the 'faithful.'

dr. cottard was never quite certain of the tone in which he ought to
reply to any observation, or whether the speaker was jesting or
in earnest. and so in any event he would embellish all his facial
expressions with the offer of a conditional, a p

lest piece of news would always take
utterly unawares this man who imagined himself to be perpetually in
readiness for anything. and seeing that no one answered him, "swann! who
on earth is swann?" he shouted, in a frenzy of anxiety which subsided
as soon as mme. verdurin had explained, "why, odette's friend, whom she
told us about."

"ah, good, good; that's all right, then," answered the doctor, at once
mollified. as for the painter, he was overjoyed at the prospect of
swann's appearing at the verdurins', because he supposed him to be in
love with odette, and was always ready to assist at lovers' meetings.
"nothing amuses me more than match-making," he confided to cottard; "i
have been tremendously successful, even with women!"

in telling the verdurins that swann was extremely 'smart,' odette had
alarmed them with the prospect of another 'bore.' when he arrived,
however, he made an excellent impression, an indirect cause of which,
though they did not know it, was his familiarity with the best

 the movement that is required without any clumsy participation
by the rest of his body. the simple and elementary gestures used by a
man of the world when he courteously holds out his hand to the unknown
youth who is being introduced to him, and when he bows discreetly before
the ambassador to whom he is being introduced, had gradually pervaded,
without his being conscious of it, the whole of swann's social
deportment, so that in the company of people of a lower grade than his
own, such as the verdurins and their friends, he instinctively shewed an
assiduity, and made overtures with which, by their account, any of their
'bores' would have dispensed. he chilled, though for a moment only,
on meeting dr. cottard; for seeing him close one eye with an ambiguous
smile, before they had yet spoken to one another (a grimace which
cottard styled "letting 'em all come"), swann supposed that the doctor
recognised him from having met him already somewhere, probably in some
house of 'ill-fame,' though these

twinkle. you know, what i want to have most of all is his smile; that's
what i've asked you to paint--the portrait of his smile." and since the
phrase struck her as noteworthy, she repeated it very loud, so as to
make sure that as many as possible of her guests should hear it, and
even made use of some indefinite pretext to draw the circle closer
before she uttered it again. swann begged to be introduced to everyone,
even to an old friend of the verdurins, called saniette, whose shyness,
simplicity and good-nature had deprived him of all the consideration due
to his skill in palaeography, his large fortune, and the distinguished
family to which he belonged. when he spoke, his words came with
a confusion which was delightful to hear because one felt that it
indicated not so much a defect in his speech as a quality of his soul,
as it were a survival from the age of innocence which he had never
wholly outgrown. all the consonants which he did not m

anage to pronounce
seemed like harsh utterances of which his gentle lips were incapable. by
asking to be made known to m. saniette, swann made m. verdurin reverse
the usual form of introduction (saying, in fact, with emphasis on the
distinction: "m. swann, pray let me present to you our friend saniette")
but he aroused in saniette himself a warmth of gratitude, which,
however, the verdurins never disclosed to swann, since saniette rather
annoyed them, and they did not feel bound to provide him with friends.
on the other hand the verdurins were extremely touched by swann's next
request, for he felt that he must ask to be introduced to the pianist's
aunt. she wore a black dress, as was her invariable custom, for she
believed that a woman always looked well in black, and that nothing
could be more distinguished; but her face was exceedingly red, as
it always was for some time after a

 a
note of pity sounded in the doctor's voice; and then struck by the
number--only eight at table--"are these luncheons what you would
describe as 'intimate'?" he inquired briskly, not so much out of idle
curiosity as in his linguistic zeal.

but so great and glorious a figure was the president of the french
republic in the eyes of dr. cottard that neither the modesty of swann
nor the spite of mme. verdurin could ever wholly efface that first
impression, and he never sat down to dinner with the verdurins without
asking anxiously, "d'you think we shall see m. swann here this evening?
he is a personal friend of m. grévy's. i suppose that means he's what
you'd call a 'gentleman'?" he even went to the length of offering swann
a card of invitation to the dental exhibition.

"this will let you in, and anyone you take with you," he explained, "but
dogs are not admitted. i'm just warning you, you understand, because
some friends of mine went there once, who hadn't been told, and there
was the devil to
 
 ___________________________
 
 pay."

as for m. verdurin, he did not fail to observe the distressing effect
upon his wife of the discovery that swann had influential friends of
whom he had never spoken.

if no arrangement had been made to 'go anywhere,' it was at the
verdurins' that swann would find the 'little nucleus' assembled, but
he never appeared there except in the evenings, and would hardly ever
accept their invitations to dinner, in spite of odette's entreaties.

"i could dine with you alone somewhere, if you'd rather," she suggested.

"but what about mme. verdurin?"

"oh, that's quite simple. i need only say that my dress wasn't ready, or
that my cab came late. there is always some excuse."

"how charming of you."

but swann said to himself that, if he coul

f her company, then the desire
that she felt for his would be all the longer in reaching the point of
satiety. besides, as he infinitely preferred to odette's style of beauty
that of a little working girl, as fresh and plump as a rose, with whom
he happened to be simultaneously in love, he preferred to spend the
first part of the evening with her, knowing that he was sure to see
odette later on. for the same reason, he would never allow odette to
call for him at his house, to take him on to the verdurins'. the little
girl used to wait, not far from his door, at a street corner; rémi, his
coachman, knew where to stop; she would jump in beside him, and hold him
in her arms until the carriage drew up at the verdurins'. he would enter
the drawing-room; and there, while mme. verdurin, pointing to the roses
which he had sent her that morning, said: "i am furious with you!" and
sent him to the place kept for him, by the side of odette, the pianist
would play to them--for their two selves, and for no

 achieved, and complete in
itself, like the mood of philosophic detachment which follows an
outburst of vain regret. but little did that matter to him; he looked
upon the sonata less in its own light--as what it might express, had,
in fact, expressed to a certain musician, ignorant that any swann or
odette, anywhere in the world, existed, when he composed it, and
would express to all those who should hear it played in centuries
to come--than as a pledge, a token of his love, which made even the
verdurins and their little pianist think of odette and, at the same
time, of himself--which bound her to him by a lasting tie; and at that
point he had (whimsically entreated by odette) abandoned the idea of
getting some 'professional' to play over to him the whole sonata, of
which he still knew no more than this one passage. "why do you want the
rest?" she had asked him. "our little bit; that's all we need." he went
farther; agonised by the reflection, at the moment when it passed by
him, so near and ye

a meaning of its own, an intrinsic and unalterable beauty, foreign to
themselves, just as in the jewels given to us, or even in the letters
written to us by a woman with whom we are in love, we find fault with
the 'water' of a stone, or with the words of a sentence because they are
not fashioned exclusively from the spirit of a fleeting intimacy and of
a 'lass unparalleled.'

it would happen, as often as not, that he had stayed so long outside,
with his little girl, before going to the verdurins' that, as soon as
the little phrase had been rendered by the pianist, swann would discover
that it was almost time for odette to go home. he used to take her back
as far as the door of her little house in the rue la pérouse, behind the
arc de triomphe. and it was perhaps on this account, and so as not to
demand the monopoly of her favours, that he sacrificed the pleasure (not
so essential to his well-being) of seeing her earlier in the evening,
of arriving with her at the verdurins', to the ex

evice he had won from
her the most affectionate letters that she had, so far, written him, one
of them (which she had sent to him at midday by a special messenger from
the maison dorée--it was the day of the paris-murcie fête given for
the victims of the recent floods in murcia) beginning "my dear, my hand
trembles so that i can scarcely write----"; and these letters he had
kept in the same drawer as the withered chrysanthemum. or else, if she
had not had time to write, when he arrived at the verdurins' she would
come running up to him with an "i've something to say to you!" and he
would gaze curiously at the revelation in her face and speech of what
she had hitherto kept concealed from him of her heart.

even as he drew near to the verdurins' door, and caught sight of the
great lamp-lit spaces of the drawing-room windows, whose shutters were
never closed, he would begin to melt at the thought of the charming
creature whom he would see, as he entered the room, basking in that
golden light. he

, and enabled him to feign indifference to
the prospect of seeing her, or even a desire not to see her; in doing
which he incurred no very great risk since, even although he had written
to her during the day, he would of necessity see her in the evening and
accompany her home.

but one evening, when, irritated by the thought of that inevitable dark
drive together, he had taken his other 'little girl' all the way to the
bois, so as to delay as long as possible the moment of his appearance at
the verdurins', he was so late in reaching them that odette, supposing
that he did not intend to come, had already left. seeing the room bare
of her, swann felt his heart wrung by sudden anguish; he shook with the
sense that he was being deprived of a pleasure whose intensity he began
then for the first time to estimate, having always, hitherto, had that
certainty of finding it whenever he would, which (as in the case of
all our pleasures) reduced, if it did not altogether blind him to its
dimensions.

"did

ere, i won't have you saying nasty things about odette," broke in
mme. verdurin in her 'spoiled child' manner. "she is charming."

"there's no reason why she shouldn't be charming; we are not saying
anything nasty about her, only that she is not the embodiment of either
virtue or intellect. after all," he turned to the painter, "does it
matter so very much whether she is virtuous or not? you can't tell; she
might be a great deal less charming if she were."

on the landing swann had run into the verdurins' butler, who had been
somewhere else a moment earlier, when he arrived, and who had been asked
by odette to tell swann (but that was at least an hour ago) that she
would probably stop to drink a cup of chocolate at prévost's on her
way home. swann set off at once for prévost's, but every few yards
his carriage was held up by others, or by people crossing the street,
loathsome obstacles each of which he would gladly have crushed beneath
his wheels, were it not that a policeman fumbling with a

ly, exaggerated whatever chance there might actually be of his
arriving at prévost's in time, and of finding her still there. and then,
in a moment of illumination, like a man in a fever who awakes from sleep
and is conscious of the absurdity of the dream-shapes among which his
mind has been wandering without any clear distinction between himself
and them, swann suddenly perceived how foreign to his nature were the
thoughts which he had been revolving in his mind ever since he had heard
at the verdurins' that odette had left, how novel the heartache from
which he was suffering, but of which he was only now conscious, as
though he had just woken up. what! all this disturbance simply because
he would not see odette, now, till to-morrow, exactly what he had been
hoping, not an hour before, as he drove toward mme. verdurin's. he was
obliged to admit also that now, as he sat in the same carriage and
drove to prévost's, he was no longer the same man, was no longer alone
even--but that a new persona

 evening, once he was in odette's company, once he had begun to
cast furtive glances at her changing countenance, and instantly to
withdraw his eyes lest she should read in them the first symbols of
desire and believe no more in his indifference, he would cease to
be able even to think of her, so busy would he be in the search for
pretexts which would enable him not to leave her immediately, and to
assure himself, without betraying his concern, that he would find her
again, next evening, at the verdurins'; pretexts, that is to say, which
would enable him to prolong for the time being, and to renew for one day
more the disappointment, the torturing deception that must always come
to him with the vain presence of this woman, whom he might approach, yet
never dared embrace.

she was not at prevost's; he must search for her, then, in every
restaurant upon the boulevards. to save time, while he went in one
direction, he sent in the other his coachman rémi (rizzo's doge loredan)

special name which he was to give to it preserved its identity--entirely
individual and new.

the ice once broken, every evening, when he had taken her home, he must
follow her into the house; and often she would come out again in her
dressing-gown, and escort him to his carriage, and would kiss him before
the eyes of his coachman, saying: "what on earth does it matter what
people see?" and on evenings when he did not go to the verdurins' (which
happened occasionally, now that he had opportunities of meeting odette
elsewhere), when--more and more rarely--he went into society, she would
beg him to come to her on his way home, however late he might be. the
season was spring, the nights clear and frosty. he would come away from
an evening party, jump into his victoria, spread a rug over his knees,
tell the friends who were leaving at the same time, and who insisted on
his going home with them, that he could not, that he was not go

whom the perpetual
sacrifice which they are making of their comfort and of their practical
interests has engendered a spiritual charm. then, though he may not
consciously have taken this into consideration, the certainty that she
was waiting for him, that she was not anywhere or with anyone else, that
he would see her before he went home, drew the sting from that anguish,
forgotten, it is true, but latent and ever ready to be reawakened, which
he had felt on the evening when odette had left the verdurins' before
his arrival, an anguish the actual cessation of which was so agreeable
that it might even be called a state of happiness. perhaps it was to
that hour of anguish that there must be attributed the importance which
odette had since assumed in his life. other people are, as a rule, so
immaterial to us that, when we have entrusted to any one of them the
power to cause so much suffering or happiness to ourselves, that person
seems at once to belong to a different universe, is surrounded with

tten to take away with him, in
memory, some detail of her fragrance or of her features, while he drove
home in his victoria, blessing the name of odette who allowed him to pay
her these daily visits, which, although they could not, he felt, bring
any great happiness to her, still, by keeping him immune from the fever
of jealousy--by removing from him every possibility of a fresh outbreak
of the heart-sickness which had manifested itself in him that evening,
when he had failed to find her at the verdurins'--might help him to
arrive, without any recurrence of those crises, of which the first had
been so distressing that it must also be the last, at the termination of
this strange series of hours in his life, hours almost enchanted, in the
same manner as these other, following hours, in which he drove through a
deserted paris by the light of the moon: noticing as he drove home that
the satellite had now changed its position, relatively to his own,
and was almost touching the horizon; feeling that

is own liking for holland (which she imagined
as ugly) and for versailles (which bored her to tears). and so he denied
himself the pleasure of visiting those places, consoling himself with
the reflection that it was for her sake that he wished to feel, to like
nothing that was not equally felt and liked by her.

like everything else that formed part of odette's environment, and was
no more, in a sense, than the means whereby he might see and talk to her
more often, he enjoyed the society of the verdurins. with them, since,
at the heart of all their entertainments, dinners, musical evenings,
games, suppers in fancy dress, excursions to the country, theatre
parties, even the infrequent 'big evenings' when they entertained
'bores,' there were the presence of odette, the sight of odette,
conversation with odette, an inestimable boon which the verdurins, by
inviting him to their house, bestowed on swann, he was happier in the
little 'nucleus' than anywhere else, and tried to find some genuine
merit

in each of its members, imagining that his tastes would lead him
to frequent their society for the rest of his life. never daring to
whisper to himself, lest he should doubt the truth of the suggestion,
that he would always be in love with odette, at least when he tried to
suppose that he would always go to the verdurins' (a proposition
which, a priori, raised fewer fundamental objections on the part of his
intelligence), he saw himself for the future continuing to meet odette
every evening; that did not, perhaps, come quite to the same thing as
his being permanently in love with her, but for the moment while he was
in love with her, to feel that he would not, one day, cease to see her
was all that he could ask. "what a charming atmosphere!" he said to
himself. "how entirely genuine life is to these people! the

r he would still
be able to see her every day, mme. verdurin was going to invite them
both to spend the summer with her in the country; swann, unconsciously
allowing gratitude and self-interest to filter into his intelligence and
to influence his ideas, went so far as to proclaim that mme. verdurin
was "a great and noble soul." should any of his old fellow-pupils in the
louvre school of painting speak to him of some rare or eminent artist,
"i'd a hundred times rather," he would reply, "have the verdurins." and,
with a solemnity of diction which was new in him: "they are magnanimous
creatures, and magnanimity is, after all, the one thing that matters,
the one thing that gives us distinction here on earth. look you, there
are only two classes of men, the magnanimous, and the rest; and i have
reached an age when one has to take sides, to decide once and for all
whom one is going to like and dislike, to stick to the people one likes,

he has a profound understanding of art. but it is
not, perhaps, in that that she is most admirable; every little action,
ingeniously, exquisitely kind, which she has performed for my sake,
every friendly attention, simple little things, quite domestic and yet
quite sublime, reveal a more profound comprehension of existence than
all your textbooks of philosophy."

* * *

he might have reminded himself, all the same, that there were various
old friends of his family who were just as simple as the verdurins,
companions of his early days who were just as fond of art, that he knew
other 'great-hearted creatures,' and that, nevertheless, since he had
cast his vote in favour of simplicity, the arts, and magnanimity, he had
entirely ceased to see them. but these people did not know odette, and,
if they had known her, would never have thought of introducing her to
him.

and so there was probably not, in the whole of the verdurin circle, a
single one of the 'faithful' who loved them, or believed that he 
 
 ___________________________
 
loved
them, as dearly as did swann. and yet, when m. verdurin said that he was
not satisfied with swann, he had not only expressed his own sentiments,
he had unwittingly discovered his wife's. doubtless swann had too
particular an affection for odette, as to which he had failed to take
mme. verdurin daily into his confidence; doubtless the very discretion
with which he availed himself of the verdurins' hospitality, refraining,
often, from coming to dine with them for a reason which they never
suspected, and in place of which they saw only an anxiety on his part
not to have to decline an invitation to the house of some 'bore' or
other; doubtless, also, and despite all the precautions which he had
taken to keep it from them, the gradual discovery which they were
making of his brilliant position in society--doubtless all these things
contributed to their general annoyance with swann. but the re

as not grotesque, and that cottard's jokes were
not amusing; in a word (and for all that he never once abandoned his
friendly attitude towards them all, or revolted from their dogmas), they
had discovered an impossibility of imposing those dogmas upon him, of
entirely converting him to their faith, the like of which they had never
come across in anyone before. they would have forgiven his going to the
houses of 'bores' (to whom, as it happened, in his heart of hearts he
infinitely preferred the verdurins and all their little 'nucleus') had
he consented to set a good example by openly renouncing those 'bores'
in the presence of the 'faithful.' but that was an abjuration which, as
they well knew, they were powerless to extort.

what a difference was there in a 'newcomer' whom odette had asked them
to invite, although she herself had met him only a few times, and on
whom they were building great hopes--the comte de forcheville! (it
turned out that he was nothing more nor less than the brother-in-l

which the painter sometimes indulged,
the bag-man's pleasantries which cottard used to hazard,--whereas
swann, who liked both men sincerely, could easily find excuses for these
without having either the courage or the hypocrisy to applaud them,
forcheville, on the other hand, was on an intellectual level which
permitted him to be stupified, amazed by the invective (without in the
least understanding what it all was about), and to be frankly delighted
by the wit. and the very first dinner at the verdurins' at which
forcheville was present threw a glaring light upon all the differences
between them, made his qualities start into prominence and precipitated
the disgrace of swann.

there was, at this dinner, besides the usual party, a professor from
the sorbonne, one brichot, who had met m. and mme. verdurin at a
watering-place somewhere, and, if his duties at the university and his
other works of scholarship had not left him with very little time
to spare, would gladly have come to them more often

the world himself, in a tone of
good-natured criticism, and not as though he were congratulating swann
upon some undeserved good fortune: "isn't that so, swann? i never see
anything of you, do i?--but then, where on earth is one to see him? the
creature spends all his time shut up with the la trémoïlles, with the
laumes and all that lot!" the imputation would have been false at any
time, and was all the more so, now that for at least a year swann had
given up going to almost any house but the verdurins'. but the mere
names of families whom the verdurins did not know were received by them
in a reproachful silence. m. verdurin, dreading the painful impression
which the mention of these 'bores,' especially when flung at her in this
tactless fashion, and in front of all the 'faithful,' was bound to
make on his wife, cast a covert glance at her, instinct with anxious
solicitude. he saw then that in her fixed resolution to take no notice,
to have escaped contact, altogether, with the news which had

view two dark cavities that were, surely, modelled from life. you would
have said that her half-opened lips were just about to speak. it was
all no more, however, than a wax cast, a mask in plaster, the sculptor's
design for a monument, a bust to be exhibited in the palace of industry,
where the public would most certainly gather in front of it and marvel
to see how the sculptor, in expressing the unchallengeable dignity of
the verdurins, as opposed to that of the la trémoïlles or laumes, whose
equals (if not, indeed, their betters) they were, and the equals and
betters of all other 'bores' upon the face of the earth, had managed to
invest with a majesty that was almost papal the whiteness and rigidity
of his stone. but the marble at last grew animated and let it be

did not know that george sand was the pseudonym of a woman. swann,
who really liked saniette, felt bound to supply him with a few facts
illustrative of the duke's culture, which would prove that such
ignorance on his part was literally impossible; but suddenly he stopped
short; he had realised, as he was speaking, that saniette needed no
proof, but knew already that the story was untrue for the simple reason
that he had at that moment invented it. the worthy man suffered acutely
from the verdurins' always finding him so dull; and as he was conscious
of having been more than ordinarily morose this evening, he had made up
his mind that he would succeed in being amusing, at least once, before
the end of dinner. he surrendered so quickly, looked so wretched at the
sight of his castle in ruins, and replied in so craven a tone to swann,
appealing to him not to persist in a refutation which was already
superfluous, "all right; all right; anyhow, even if i have made a
mistake that's not a crime,

there are certain original and distinguished authors in whom the least
'freedom of speech' is thought revolting because they have not begun
by flattering the public taste, and serving up to it the commonplace
expressions to which it is used; it was by the same process that swann
infuriated m. verdurin. in his case as in theirs it was the novelty
of his language which led his audience to suspect the blackness of his
designs.

swann was still unconscious of the disgrace that threatened him at the
verdurins', and continued to regard all their absurdities in the most
rosy light, through the admiring eyes of love.

as a rule he made no appointments with odette except for the evenings;
he was afraid of her growing tired of him if he visited her during the
day as well; at the same time he was reluctant to forfeit, even for
an hour, the place that he held in her thoughts, and so was constantly
looking out for an opportunity of claiming her attention, in any way
that would not be displeasing to her. if,

and would increase her affection for himself; and he would order them to
be taken at once to the rue la pérouse, so as to accelerate the moment
in which, as she received an offering from him, he might feel himself,
in a sense, transported into her presence. he was particularly anxious,
always, that she should receive these presents before she went out
for the evening, so that her sense of gratitude towards him might give
additional tenderness to her welcome when he arrived at the verdurins',
might even--for all he knew--if the shopkeeper made haste, bring him a
letter from her before dinner, or herself, in person, upon his doorstep,
come on a little extraordinary visit of thanks. as in an earlier phase,
when he had experimented with the reflex action of anger and contempt
upon her character, he sought now by that of gratification to elicit
from her fresh particles of her intimate feelings, which she had never
yet revealed.

 light from a house. his mind
fumbled, for a moment, in the darkness, he took off his spectacles,
wiped the glasses, passed his hands over his eyes, but saw no light
until he found himself face to face with a wholly different idea, the
realisation that he must endeavour, in the coming month, to send odette
six or seven thousand-franc notes instead of five, simply as a surprise
for her and to give her pleasure.

in the evening, when he did not stay at home until it was time to meet
odette at the verdurins', or rather at one of the open-air restaurants
which they liked to frequent in the bois and especially at saint-cloud,
he would go to dine in one of those fashionable houses in which, at one
time, he had been a constant guest. he did not wish to lose touch with
people who, for all that he knew, might be of use, some day, to odette,
and thanks to whom he was often, in the meantime, able to procure for
her some privilege or pleasure. besides, he had been used for so long to
the refinement and com

animal which
he might take everywhere, and would keep with him at the dinner-table,
unobserved by his fellow-guests. he would stroke and fondle it, warm
himself with it, and, as a feeling of languor swept over him, would
give way to a slight shuddering movement which contracted his throat
and nostrils--a new experience, this,--as he fastened the bunch of
columbines in his buttonhole. he had for some time been feeling neither
well nor happy, especially since odette had brought forcheville to the
verdurins', and he would have liked to go away for a while to rest in
the country. but he could never summon up courage to leave paris, even
for a day, while odette was there. the weather was warm; it was the
finest part of the spring. and for all that he was driving through a
city of stone to immure himself in a house without grass or garden, what
was incessantly before his eyes was a park which he owned, near combray,
where, at four in the afternoon, before coming to the asparagus-bed,
thanks to the br

sat down to dinner,
trained and twined by the gardener's skilful hand, there ran all about
his table currant-bush and rose.

after dinner, if he had an early appointment in the bois or at
saint-cloud, he would rise from table and leave the house so
abruptly--especially if it threatened to rain, and so to scatter the
'faithful' before their normal time--that on one occasion the princesse
des laumes (at whose house dinner had been so late that swann had left
before the coffee came in, to join the verdurins on the island in the
bois) observed:

"really, if swann were thirty years older, and had diabetes, there might
be some excuse for his running away like that. he seems to look upon us
all as a joke."

he persuaded himself that the spring-time charm, which he could not go
down to combray to enjoy, he would find at least on the he des cygnes
or at saint-cloud. but as he could think only of odette, he would
return home not knowing even if he had tasted the fragrance of the young
leaves, or if the m

oon had been shining. he would be welcomed by the
little phrase from the sonata, played in the garden on the restaurant
piano. if there was none in the garden, the verdurins would have taken
immense pains to have a piano brought out either from a private room
or from the restaurant itself; not because swann was now restored to
favour; far from it. but the idea of arranging an ingenious form of
entertainment for some one, even for some one whom they disliked, would
stimulate them, during the time spent in its preparation, to a momentary
sense of cordiality and affection. now and then he would remind himself
that another fine spring evening was drawing to a close, an

d would force
himself to notice the trees and the sky. but the state of excitement
into which odette's presence never failed to throw him, added to a
feverish ailment which, for some time now, had scarcely left him,
robbed him of that sense of quiet and comfort which is an indispensable
background to the impressions that we derive from nature.

one evening, when swann had consented to dine with the verdurins, and
had mentioned during dinner that he had to attend, next day, the annual
banquet of an old comrades' association, odette had at once exclaimed
across the table, in front of everyone, in front of forcheville, who was
now one of the 'faithful,' in front of the painter, in front of cottard:

"yes, i know, you have your banquet to-morrow; i sha'n't see you, then,
till i get home; don't be too late."

and although swann had never yet taken offence, at all seriously,
at odette's demonstrations of

 pleasure that he
tasted in her company, every new caress that he invented (and had been
so imprudent as to point out to her how delightful it was), every fresh
charm that he found in her, for he knew that, a moment later, they
would go to enrich the collection of instruments in his secret
torture-chamber.

a fresh turn was given to the screw when swann recalled a sudden
expression which he had intercepted, a few days earlier, and for the
first time, in odette's eyes. it was after dinner at the verdurins'.
whether it was because forcheville, aware that saniette, his
brother-in-law, was not in favour with them, had decided to make a butt
of him, and to shine at his expense, or because he had been annoyed
by some awkward remark which saniette had made to him, although it had
passed unnoticed by the rest of the party who knew nothing of whatever
tactless allusion it might conceal, or possibly because he had been for
some time looking out for an opportunity of securing the expulsion from

ured him. and how could he not have
turned misanthrope, when in every man he saw a potential lover for
odette? thus his jealousy did even more than the happy, passionate
desire which he had originally felt for odette had done to alter swann's
character, completely changing, in the eyes of the world, even the
outward signs by which that character had been intelligible.

a month after the evening on which he had intercepted and read odette's
letter to forcheville, swann went to a dinner which the verdurins were
giving in the bois. as the party was breaking up he noticed a series of
whispered discussions between mme. verdurin and several of her guests,
and thought that he heard the pianist being reminded to come next day to
a party at chatou; now he, swann, had not been invited to any party.

the verdurins had spoken only in whispers, and in vague terms, but the
painter, perhaps without thinking, shouted out: "there must be no lights
of any sort, and he must play the moonlight sonata in the dark,

asant who is
engaged in taking its life. and when mme. verdurin's carriage had moved
on, and swann's took its place, his coachman, catching sight of his
face, asked whether he was unwell, or had heard bad news.

swann sent him away; he preferred to walk, and it was on foot, through
the bois, that he came home. he talked to himself, aloud, and in
the same slightly affected tone which he had been used to adopt
when describing the charms of the 'little nucleus' and extolling the
magnanimity of the verdurins. but just as the conversation, the smiles,
the kisses of odette became as odious to him as he had once found
them charming, if they were diverted to others than himself, so the
verdurins' drawing-room, which, not an hour before, had still seemed
to him amusing, inspired with a genuine feeling for art and even with
a sort of moral aristocracy, now that it was another than himself whom
odette was going to meet there, to love there without restraint, laid
bare to him all its absurdities, its stupi

forcheville there, can't you, odette?"... '"in the dark!' codfish!
pander!"... 'pander' was the name he applied also to the music which
would invite them to sit in silence, to dream together, to gaze in each
other's eyes, to feel for each other's hands. he felt that there was
much to be said, after all, for a sternly censorous attitude towards
the arts, such as plato adopted, and bossuet, and the old school of
education in france.

in a word, the life which they led at the verdurins', which he had so
often described as 'genuine,' seemed to him now the worst possible form
of life, and their 'little nucleus' the most degraded class of society.
"it really is," he repeated, "beneath the lowest rung of the social
ladder, the nethermost circle of dante. beyond a doubt, the august words
of the florentine refer to the verdurins! when one comes to think of it,
surely people 'in society' (and, though one may find fault with them now

they're the most perfect specimens of their disgusting class! thank god,
it was high time that i stopped condescending to promiscuous intercourse
with such infamy, such dung."

but, just as the virtues which he had still attributed, an hour or so
earlier, to the verdurins, would not have sufficed, even although the
verdurins had actually possessed them, if they had not also favoured
and protected his love, to excite swann to that state of intoxication
in which he waxed tender over their magnanimity, an intoxication which,
even when disseminated through the medium of other persons, could
have come to him from odette alone;--so the immorality (had it really
existed) which he now found in the verdurins would have been powerless,

doubtless swann's voice shewed a finer perspicacity than his own when it
refused to utter those words full of disgust at the verdurins and their
circle, and of joy at his having shaken himself free of it, save in an
artificial and rhetorical tone, and as though his words had been chosen
rather to appease his anger than to express his thoughts. the latter, in
fact, while he abandoned himself to invective, were probably, though he
did not know it, occupied with a wholly different matter, for once he
had reached his house, no sooner had he closed the front-door behind him
than he suddenly struck his forehead, and, making his serv

door again, dashed out into the street shouting, in a voice which,
this time, was quite natural; "i believe i have found a way of getting
invited to the dinner at chatou to-morrow!" but it must have been a
bad way, for m. swann was not invited; dr. cottard, who, having been
summoned to attend a serious case in the country, had not seen the
verdurins for some days, and had been prevented from appearing at
chatou, said, on the evening after this dinner, as he sat down to table
at their house:

"why, aren't we going to see m. swann this evening? he is quite what you
might call a personal friend..." "i sincerely trust that we sha'n't!"
cried mme. verdurin. "heaven preserve us from him; he's too deadly for
words, a stupid, ill-bred boor."

on hearing these words cottard exhibited an intense astonishment blended
with entire submission, as though

 in the face of a scientific truth
which contradicted everything that he had previously believed, but was
supported by an irresistible weight of evidence; with timorous
emotion he bowed his head over his plate, and merely replied:
"oh--oh--oh--oh--oh!" traversing, in an orderly retirement of his
forces, into the depths of his being, along a descending scale, the
whole compass of his voice. after which there was no more talk of swann
at the verdurins'.

and so that drawing-room which had brought swann and odette together
became an obstacle in the way of their meeting. she no longer said to
him, as she had said in the early days of their love: "we shall meet,
anyhow, to-morrow evening; there's a supper-party at the verdurins',"
but "we sha'n't be able to meet to-morrow evening; there's a
supper-party at the verdurins'." or else the verdurins were taking her
to the opéra-comique, to see _une nuit de cléopâtre_, and swann could

in her and could not find again. and yet the
knowledge that, within this new and strange chrysalis, it was still
odette that lurked, still the same volatile temperament, artful and
evasive, was enough to keep swann seeking, with as much passion as ever,
to captivate her. then he would look at photographs of her, taken two
years before, and would remember how exquisite she had been. and that
would console him, a little, for all the sufferings that he voluntarily
endured on her account.

when the verdurins took her off to saint-germain, or to chatou, or to
meulan, as often as not, if the weather was fine, they would propose
to remain there for the night, and not go home until next day. mme.
verdurin would endeavour to set at rest the scruples of the pianist,
whose aunt had remained in paris: "she will be only too glad to be rid
of you for a day. how on earth could she be anxious, when she knows
you're with us? anyhow, i'll take you all under my wing; she can put the
blame on me."

if this attempt

 failed, m. verdurin would set off across country until
he came to a telegraph office or some other kind of messenger, after
first finding out which of the 'faithful' had anyone whom they must
warn. but odette would thank him, and assure him that she had no message
for anyone, for she had told swann, once and for all, that she could
not possibly send messages to him, before all those people, without
compromising herself. sometimes she would be absent for several days
on end, when the verdurins took her to see the tombs at dreux, or to
compiègne, on the painter's advice, to watch the sun setting through the
forest--after which they went on to the château of pierrefonds.

"to think that she could visit really historic buildings with me, who
have spent ten years in the study of architecture, who am constantly
bombarded, by people who really count, to take them over beauvais or

it was, indeed, a piece of bad luck that she had forbidden him access
to the one spot that tempted him to-day. to-day! why, if he went down
there, in defiance of her prohibition, he would be able to see her that
very day! but then, whereas, if she had met, at pierrefonds, some one
who did not matter, she would have hailed him with obvious pleasure:
"what, you here?" and would have invited him to come and see her at the
hotel where she was staying with the verdurins, if, on the other hand,
it was himself, swann, that she encountered there, she would be annoyed,
would complain that she was being followed, would love him less in
consequence, might even turn away in anger when she caught sight of him.
"so, then, i am not to be allowed to go away for a day anywhere!" she
would reproach him on her return, whereas in fact it was he himself who
was not allowed to go.

beautiful in his eyes since it was on her account that he had gone to
visit it; in all the streets of the town, which struck him as romantic;
down every ride of the forest, roseate with the deep and tender glow of
sunset;--innumerable and alternative hiding-places, to which would fly
simultaneously for refuge, in the uncertain ubiquity of his hopes, his
happy, vagabond and divided heart. "we mustn't, on any account," he
would warn m. de forestelle, "run across odette and the verdurins. i
have just heard that they are at pierrefonds, of all places, to-day. one
has plenty of time to see them in paris; it would hardly be worth while
coming down here if one couldn't go a yard without meeting them." and
his host would fail to understand why, once they had reached the place,
swann would change his plans twenty times in an hour, inspect the
dining-rooms of all the hotels in compiègne without being able to make
up his mind to settle down in any of them, although he had found no

claimed to be most anxious to avoid, and would in fact avoid, the moment
he found it, for if he had come upon the little 'group,' he would have
hastened away at once with studied indifference, satisfied that he had
seen odette and she him, especially that she had seen him when he was
not, apparently, thinking about her. but no; she would guess at
once that it was for her sake that he had come there. and when m. de

ite of the orders which he had gone downstairs a dozen times to
deliver in person, they were quite capable of telling her that he was
not at home. it was only a servant coming in. he noticed the incessant
rumble of passing carriages, to which he had never before paid any
attention. he could hear them, one after another, a long way off, coming
nearer, passing his door without stopping, and bearing away into the
distance a message which was not for him. he waited all night, to no
purpose, for the verdurins had returned unexpectedly, and odette had
been in paris since midday; it had not occurred to her to tell him; not
knowing what to do with herself she had spent the evening alone at a
theatre, had long since gone home to bed, and was peacefully asleep.

as a matter of fact, she had never given him a thought. and such moments
as these, in which she forgot swann's very existence, were of more value
to odette, did more to attach him to her, than all her infidelities. for
in this way swann was kept

in that state of painful agitation which had
once before been effective in making his interest blossom into love, on
the night when he had failed to find odette at the verdurins' and had
hunted for her all evening. and he did not have (as i had, afterwards,
at combray in my childhood) happy days in which to forget the sufferings
that would return with the night. for his days, swann must pass them
without odette; and as he told himself, now and then, to allow so pretty
a woman to go out by herself in paris was just as rash as to leave a
case filled with jewels in the middle of the street. in this mood he
would scowl furiously at the passers-by, as though they were so ma

lulled; he would bless the name of odette, and next day, in the morning,
would order the most attractive jewels to be sent to her, because her
kindnesses to him overnight had excited either his gratitude, or the
desire to see them repeated, or a paroxysm of love for her which had
need of some such outlet.

but at other times, grief would again take hold of him; he would imagine
that odette was forcheville's mistress, and that, when they had both sat
watching him from the depths of the verdurins' landau, in the bois, on
the evening before the party at chatou to which he had not been invited,
while he implored her in vain, with that look of despair on his face
which even his coachman had noticed, to come home with him, and then
turned away, solitary, crushed,--she must have employed, to draw
forcheville's attention to him, while she murmured: "do look at him,
storming!" the same glance, brilliant, malicious, sidelong, cunning, as
on the evening when forcheville had driven saniette from

the verdurins'.

at such times swann detested her. "but i've been a fool, too," he would
argue. "i'm paying for other men's pleasures with my money. all the
same, she'd better take care, and not pull the string too often, for
i might very well stop giving her anything at all. at any rate, we'd
better knock off supplementary favours for the time being. to think
that, only yesterday, when she said she would like to go to bayreuth

ged odette, he detested her still more, and
would be able, if it turned out--as he tried to convince himself--that
she was indeed guilty of them, to take the opportunity of punishing her,
emptying upon her the overflowing vials of his wrath. in this way, he
went so far as to suppose that he was going to receive a letter from
her, in which she would ask him for money to take the house at bayreuth,
but with the warning that he was not to come there himself, as she had
promised forcheville and the verdurins to invite them. oh, how he
would have loved it, had it been conceivable that she would have
that audacity. what joy he would have in refusing, in drawing up that
vindictive reply, the terms of which he amused himself by selecting and
declaiming aloud, as though he had actually received her letter.

the very next day, her letter came. she wrote that the verdurins and
their friends had expressed a desire to be present at these performances
of wagner, and that, if he would be so good as to send he

she would be able at last, after going so often to their house, to have
the pleasure of entertaining the verdurins in hers. of him she said not
a word; it was to be taken for granted that their presence at bayreuth
would be a bar to his.

then that annihilating answer, every word of which he had carefully
rehearsed overnight, without venturing to hope that it could ever be
used, he had the satisfaction of having it conveyed to her. alas! he
felt only too certain that with the money which she had, or could easily
procure, she would be able, all the same, to take a house at bayreuth,

rvice to-day, feeling
no anger towards them because he no longer loved them? if the day ever
came when he would find himself in the same state of indifference with
regard to odette, he would then understand that it was his jealousy
alone which had led him to find something atrocious, unpardonable, in
this desire (after all, so natural a desire, springing from a childlike
ingenuousness and also from a certain delicacy in her nature) to be
able, in her turn, when an occasion offered, to repay the verdurins for
their hospitality, and to play the hostess in a house of her own.

he returned to the other point of view--opposite to that of his love
and of his jealousy, to which he resorted at times by a sort of mental
equity, and in order to make allowance for different eventualities--from
which he tried to form a fresh judgment of odette, based on the
supposition that he had never been in love with her, that she was to him
just a woman like other women, that her life had not been (whenever he

patience of the seamstress), a shroud from the constant image of which
in her mind's eye she drew a certain satisfactory sense, if not actually
of wealth and prosperity, at any rate of self-esteem. but most of
all,--since in every one of his actions and thoughts which had reference
to odette, swann was constantly subdued and swayed by the unconfessed
feeling that he was, perhaps not less dear, but at least less welcome
to her than anyone, even the most wearisome of the verdurins'
'faithful,'--when he betook himself to a world in which he was the
paramount example of taste, a man whom no pains were spared to attract,
whom people were genuinely sorry not to see, he began once again to
believe in the existence of a happier life, almost to feel an appetite
for it, as an invalid may feel who has been in bed for months and on a
strict diet, when he picks up a newspaper and reads the account of an
official banquet or the advertisement of a cruise round sicily.

exclaimed: "but i can see you at any time; i am always free!"--she, who
was never free now; the interest, the curiosity that she had shewn in
his life, her passionate desire that he should do her the favour--of
which it was he who, then, had felt suspicious, as of a possibly tedious
waste of his time and disturbance of his arrangements--of granting her
access to his study; how she had been obliged to beg that he would let
her take him to the verdurins'; and, when he did allow her to come to
him once a month, how she had first, before he would let himself be
swayed, had to repeat what a joy it would be to her, that custom of
their seeing each other daily, for which she had longed at a time when
to him it had seemed only a tiresome distraction, for which, since that
time, she had conceived a distaste and had definitely broken herself
of it, while it had become for him so insatiable, so dolorous a need.

 logical elements. but ever since, more than a year
before, discovering to him many of the riches of his own soul, the love
of music had been born, and for a time at least had dwelt in him, swann
had regarded musical _motifs_ as actual ideas, of another world, of
another order, ideas veiled in shadows, unknown, impenetrable by
the human mind, which none the less were perfectly distinct one from
another, unequal among themselves in value and in significance. when,
after that first evening at the verdurins', he had had the little
phrase played over to him again, and had sought to disentangle from his
confused impressions how it was that, like a perfume or a caress,
it swept over and enveloped him, he had observed that it was to the
closeness of the intervals between the five notes which composed it and
to the constant repetition of two of them that was due that impression
of a frigid, a contracted sweetness; but in reality he knew that he
was basing this conclusion not upon the phrase itself, but

 merely upon
certain equivalents, substituted (for his mind's convenience) for the
mysterious entity of which he had become aware, before ever he knew the
verdurins, at that earlier party, when for the first time he had heard
the sonata played. he knew that his memory of the piano falsified still
further the perspective in which he saw the music, that the field
open to the musician is not a miserable stave of seven notes, but an
immeasurable keyboard (still, almost all of it, unknown), on which,
here and there only, separated by the gross darkness of its unexplored
tracts, some few among the millions of keys, keys of tenderness, of
passion, of courage, of

themselves led by fate to act in a manner abhorrent to people of our own
class? he also suspected my grandfather. on every occasion when swann
had asked him to do him any service, had he not invariably declined?
besides, with his ideas of middle-class respectability, he might have
thought that he was acting for swann's good. he suspected, in turn,
bergotte, the painter, the verdurins; paused for a moment to admire
once again the wisdom of people in society, who refused to mix in the
artistic circles in which such things were possible, were, perhaps, even
openly avowed, as excellent jokes; but then he recalled the marks of
honesty that were to be observed in those bohemians, and contrasted them
with the life of expedients, often bordering on fraudulence, to which
the want of money, the craving for luxury, the corrupting influence of
their pleasures often drove members of the

often say that, by pointing out to a man the
faults of his mistress, you succeed only in strengthening his attachment
to her, because he does not believe you; yet how much more so if he
does! but, swann asked himself, how could he manage to protect her? he
might perhaps be able to preserve her from the contamination of any
one woman, but there were hundreds of other women; and he realised how
insane had been his ambition when he had begun (on the evening when
he had failed to find odette at the verdurins') to desire the
possession--as if that were ever possible--of another person. happily
for swann, beneath the mass of suffering which had invaded his soul like
a conquering horde of barbarians, there lay a natural foundation, older,
more placid, and silently laborious, like the cells of an injured organ
which at once set to work to repair the damaged tissues, or the muscles
of a paralysed limb which tend to recover their former movements. these

ch he had hitherto paid least attention, almost a
new sentence, came to relieve the first, and to strike at him with
undiminished force. the memory of the evening on which he had dined with
the princesse des laumes was painful to him, but it was no more than
the centre, the core of his pain. that radiated vaguely round about it,
overflowing into all the preceding and following days. and on whatever
point in it he might intend his memory to rest, it was the whole of that
season, during which the verdurins had so often gone to dine upon the
island in the bois, that sprang back to hurt him. so violently, that by
slow degrees the curiosity which his jealousy was ever exciting in him
was neutralised by his fear of the fresh tortures which he would be
inflicting upon himself were he to satisfy it. he recognised that all
the period of odette's life which had elapsed before she first met him,
a period of which he had never sought to form any picture in his mind,
was not the featureless abstraction whic

she ended discreetly, and left swann with the girl who had the blue
eyes. but presently he rose and said good-bye to her. she had ceased to
interest him. she did not know odette.

the painter having been ill, dr. cottard recommended a sea-voyage;
several of the 'faithful' spoke of accompanying him; the verdurins could
not face the prospect of being left alone in paris, so first of all
hired, and finally purchased a yacht; thus odette was constantly going
on a cruise. whenever she had been away for any length of time, swann
would feel that he was beginning to detach himself from her, but, as
though this moral distance were proportionate to the physical distance
between them, whenever he heard that odette had returned to paris, he
could not rest without seeing her. once, when they had gone away, as

fresh from the cleaners. wearing these badges of rank, she would,
in fine weather, go on foot from one house to another in the same
neighbourhood, but when she had to proceed to another district, would
make use of a transfer-ticket on the omnibus. for the first minute or
two, until the natural courtesy of the woman broke through the starched
surface of the doctor's-wife, not being certain, either, whether
she ought to mention the verdurins before swann, she produced, quite
naturally, in her slow and awkward, but not unattractive voice, which,
every now and then, was completely drowned by the rattling of the
omnibus, topics selected from those which she had picked up and would
repeat in each of the score of houses up the stairs of which she
clambered in the course of an afternoon.

"i needn't ask you, m. swann, whether a man so much in the movement as
yourself has been to the mirlitons, to see the portrait by machard that

having exhausted this topic, to which she had been inspired by the
loftiness of her plume, the monogram on her card-case, the little number
inked inside each of her gloves by the cleaner, and the difficulty of
speaking to swann about the verdurins, mme. cottard, seeing that they
had still a long way to go before they would reach the corner of the
rue bonaparte, where the conductor was to set her down, listened to the
promptings of her heart, which counselled other words than these.

"your ears must have been burning," she ventured, "while we were on the
yacht with mme. verdurin. we were talking about you all the time."

swann was genuinely astonished, for he supposed that his name was never
uttered in the verdurins' presence.
