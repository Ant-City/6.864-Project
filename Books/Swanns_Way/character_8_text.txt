without appearing to have seen me, but with an intensity, a half-hidden
smile which i was unable to interpret, according to the instruction i
had received in the ways of good breeding, save as a mark of infinite
disgust; and her hand, at the same time, sketched in the air an
indelicate gesture, for which, when it was addressed in public to a
person whom one did not know, the little dictionary of manners which
i carried in my mind supplied only one meaning, namely, a deliberate
insult.

"gilberte, come along; what are you doing?" called out in a piercing
tone of authority a lady in white, whom i had not seen until that
moment, while, a little way beyond her, a gentleman in a suit of linen
'ducks,' whom i did not know either, stared at me with eyes which seemed
to be starting from his head; the little girl's smile abruptly faded,
and, seizing her trowel, she made off without turning to look again in
my direction, with an air of obedience, inscrutable and sly.

talisman which might, perhaps, enable me some day to rediscover her whom
its syllables had just endowed with a definite personality, whereas, a
moment earlier, she had been only something vaguely seen. so it came
to me, uttered across the heads of the stocks and jasmines, pungent and
cool as the drops which fell from the green watering-pipe; impregnating
and irradiating the zone of pure air through which it had passed, which
it set apart and isolated from all other air, w

 their familiarity--so exquisitely painful to
myself--with her, and with all that unknown world of her existence, into
which i should never penetrate.

for a moment (while we moved away, and my grandfather murmured: "poor
swann, what a life they are leading him; fancy sending him away so
that she can be left alone with her charlus--for that was charlus: i
recognised him at once! and the child, too; at her age, to be mixed up
in all that!") the impression left on me by the despotic tone in which
gilberte's mother had spoken to her, without her replying, by exhibiting
her to me as being obliged to yield obedience to some one else, as not
being indeed superior to the whole world, calmed my sufferings somewhat,
revived some hope in me, and cooled the ardour of my love. but very soon
that love surged up again in me like a reaction by which my humiliated
heart was endeavouring to rise to gilberte's level, or to draw her down
to its own. i loved her; i was sorry not to have had the time and the

the name, which had for me become almost mythological, of swann--when i
talked with my family i would grow sick with longing to hear them
utter it; i dared not pronounce it myself, but i would draw them into a
discussion of matters which led naturally to gilberte and her family, in
which she was involved, in speaking of which i would feel myself not too
remotely banished from her company; and i would suddenly force my father
(by pretending, for instance, to believe that my grandfather's business
had been in our family before his day, or that the hedge with the pink
hawthorn which my aunt léonie wished to visit was on common ground) to
correct my statements, to say, as though in opposition to me and of his

st; then she had
gone away to lay down her things on a chair that stood with its back to
a shrubbery of laurels; while i waited for her i was pacing the broad
lawn, of meagre close-cropped grass already faded by the sun, dominated,
at its far end, by a statue rising from a fountain, in front of which a
little girl with reddish hair was playing with a shuttlecock; when, from
the path, another little girl, who was putting on her cloak and covering
up her battledore, called out sharply: "good-bye, gilberte, i'm going
home now; don't forget, we're coming to you this evening, after dinner."
the name gilberte passed close by me, evoking all the more forcibly her
whom it labelled in that it did not merely refer to her, as one speaks
of a man in his absence, but was directly addressed to her; it passed
thus close by me, in action, so to speak, with a force that
increased with the curve of its trajectory and as it drew near to
its target;--carrying in its wake, i could feel, the knowledge, the

effect that once, when, they found, they were not enough to make up a
prisoner's base, she sent one of them to ask me if i cared to complete
their side, and from that day i played with her whenever she came.
but this did not happen every day; there were days when she had
been prevented from coming by her lessons, by her catechism, by a
luncheon-party, by the whole of that life, separated from my own, which
twice only, condensed into the name of gilberte, i had felt pass so
painfully close to me, in the hawthorn lane near combray and on the
grass of the champs-elysées. on such days she would have told us
beforehand that we should not see her; if it were because of her
lessons, she would say: "it is too tiresome, i sha'n't be able to come
to-morrow; you will all be enjoying yourselves here without me," with an
air of regret which to some extent consoled me; if, on the other hand,
she had been invited to a party, and i, not knowing this, asked h

days i did at least know that i should not see her, whereas on others,
without any warning, her mother would take her for a drive, or some such
thing, and next day she would say: "oh, yes! i went out with mamma,"
as though it had been the most natural thing in the world, and not the
greatest possible misfortune for some one else. there were also the days
of bad weather on which her governess, afraid, on her own account, of
the rain, would not bring gilberte to the champs-elysées.

and so, if the heavens were doubtful, from early morning i would not
cease to interrogate them, observing all the omens. if i saw the lady
opposite, just inside her window, putting on her hat, i would say to
myself: "that lady is going out; it must, therefore, be weather in which
one can go out. why should not gilberte do the same as that lady?" but
the day grew dark. my mother said that it might clear again, that one
burst of sunshine would be enough, but that more pro

and on those days when all other vegetation had disappeared, when the
fine jerkins of green leather which covered the trunks of the old trees
were hidden beneath the snow; after the snow had ceased to fall, but
when the sky was still too much overcast for me to hope that gilberte
would venture out, then suddenly--inspiring my mother to say: "look,
it's quite fine now; i think you might perhaps try going to the
champs-elysées after all."--on the mantle of snow that swathed the
balcony, the sun had appeared and was stitching seams of gold, with
embroidered patches of dark shadow. that day we found no one there, or
else a solitary girl, on the point of departure, who assured me that
gilberte was not coming. the chairs, deserted by the imposing but
uninspiring company of g

overnesses, stood empty. only, near the grass,
was sitting a lady of uncertain age who came in all weathers, dressed
always in an identical style, splendid and sombre, to make whose
acquaintance i would have, at that period, sacrificed, had it lain in my
power, all the greatest opportunities in my life to come. for gilberte
went up every day to speak to her; she used to ask gilberte for news of
her "dearest mother" and it struck me that, if i had known her, i should
have been for gilberte some one wholly different, some one who knew
people in her parents' world. while her grandchildren played together at
a little distance, she would sit and read the débats, which she called
"my old _débats_!" as, with an aristocratic familiarity, she would say,
speaking of the police-sergeant or the woman who let the chairs, "my
old friend the police-sergeant," or "the chair-keeper and i, who are old
friends."

françoise found it too cold to stand about, so we walked to the pont

ch seemed to explain its gesture. the old lady
herself, having folded up her _débats_, asked a passing nursemaid
the time, thanking her with "how very good of you!" then begged the
road-sweeper to tell her grandchildren to come, as she felt cold, adding
"a thousand thanks. i am sorry to give you so much trouble!" suddenly
the sky was rent in two: between the punch-and-judy and the horses,
against the opening horizon, i had just seen, like a miraculous sign,
mademoiselle's blue feather. and now gilberte was running at full speed
towards me, sparkling and rosy beneath a cap trimmed with fur, enlivened
by the cold, by being late, by her anxiety for a game; shortly before
she reached me, she slipped on a piece of ice and, either to regain her
balance, or because it appeared to her graceful, or else pretending
that she was on skates, it was with outstretched arms that she smilingly
advanced, as though to embrace me. "bravo! bravo! that's splendid;
'topping,' i should say, like you--'sporting,' i s

uppose i ought to say,
only i'm a hundred-and-one, a woman of the old school," exclaimed the
lady, uttering, on behalf of the voiceless champs-elysées, their thanks
to gilberte for having come, without letting herself be frightened
away by the weather. "you are like me, faithful at all costs to our old
champs-elysées; we are two brave souls! you wouldn't believe me, i dare
say, if i told you that i love them, even like this. this snow (i know,
you'll laugh at me), it makes me think of ermine!" and the old lady
began to laugh herself.

the first of these days--to which the snow, a symbol of the powers that
were able to deprive me of the sight of gilberte, imparted the

 predilection that she shewed for me in thus
tolerating me as her travelling companion in this new, this wintry land,
and a sort of loyalty to me which she preserved through evil times.
presently, one after another, like shyly bopping sparrows, her friends
arrived, black against the snow. we got ready to play and, since this
day which had begun so sadly was destined to end in joy, as i went up,
before the game started, to the friend with the sharp voice whom i had
heard, that first day, calling gilberte by name, she said to me: "no,
no, i'm sure you'd much rather be in gilberte's camp; besides, look,
she's signalling to you." she was in fact summoning me to cross the
snowy lawn to her camp, to 'take the field,' which the sun, by casting
over it a rosy gleam, the metallic lustre of old and worn brocades, had
turned into a field of the cloth of gold.

this day, which i had begun with so many misgivings, was, as it
happened, one of the few on which i was not unduly wretched.

onger thought, now, of anything save not to let a
single day pass without seeing gilberte (so much so that once, when my
grandmother had not come home by dinner-time, i could not resist the
instinctive reflection that, if she had been run over in the street
and killed, i should not for some time be allowed to play in the
champs-elysées; when one is in love one has no love left for anyone),
yet those moments which i spent in her company, for which i had waited
with so much impatience all night and morning, for which i had quivered
with excitement, to which i would have sacrificed ev

erything else in the
world, were by no means happy moments; well did i know it, for they
were the only moments in my life on which i concentrated a scrupulous,
undistracted attention, and yet i could not discover in them one atom
of pleasure. all the time that i was away from gilberte, i wanted to see
her, because, having incessantly sought to form a mental picture of her,
i was unable, in the end, to do so, and did not know exactly to what my
love corresponded. besides, she had never yet told me that she loved me.
far from it, she had often boasted that she knew other little boys whom
she preferred to myself, that i was a good companion, with whom she was
always willing to play, although i was too absent-minded, not attentive
enough to the game. moreover, she had often shew

n signs of apparent
coldness towards me, which might have shaken my faith that i was for her
a creature different from the rest, had that faith been founded upon a
love that gilberte had felt for me, and not, as was the case, upon
the love that i felt for her, which strengthened its resistance to the
assaults of doubt by making it depend entirely upon the manner in which
i was obliged, by an internal compulsion, to think of gilberte. but my
feelings with regard to her i had never yet ventured to express to her
in words. of course, on every page of my exercise-books, i wrote out,
in endless repetition, her name and address, but at the sight of those
vague lines which i might trace, without her having to think, on that
account, of me, i felt discouraged, because they spoke to me, not of
gilberte, who would never so much as see them, but of my own desire,
which they seemed to shew me in its true colours, as something purely

ersonal, unreal, tedious and ineffective. the most important thing
was that we should see each other, gilberte and i, and should have an
opportunity of making a mutual confession of our love which, until then,
would not officially (so to speak) have begun. doubtless the various
reasons which made me so impatient to see her would have appeared less
urgent to a grown man. as life goes on, we acquire such adroitness in
the culture of our pleasures, that we content ourselves with that which
we derive from thinking of a woman, as i was thinking of gilberte,
without troubling ourselves to ascertain whether th

e image corresponds
to the reality,--and with the pleasure of loving her, without needing to
be sure, also, that she loves us; or again that we renounce the pleasure
of confessing our passion for her, so as to preserve and enhance the
passion that she has for us, like those japanese gardeners who, to
obtain one perfect blossom, will sacrifice the rest. but at the period
when i was in love with gilberte, i still believed that love did really
exist, apart from ourselves; that, allowing us, at the most, to surmount
the obstacles in our way, it offered us its blessings in an order in
which we were not free to make the least alteration; it seemed to me
that if i had, on my own initiative, substituted for the sweetness of
a confession a pretence of indifference, i should not only have been
depriving myself of one of the joys of which i had most often dreamed,
i should have been fabricating, of my o

wn free will, a love that was
artificial and without value, that bore no relation to the truth, whose
mysterious and foreordained ways i should thus have been declining to
follow.

but when i arrived at the champs-elysées,--and, as at first sight
it appeared, was in a position to confront my love, so as to make it
undergo the necessary modifications, with its living and independent
cause--as soon as i was in the presence of that gilberte swann on the
sight of whom i had counted to revive the images that my tired memory
had lost and could not find again, of that gilberte swann with whom i
had been playing the day before, and whom i had just been prompted to
greet, and then to recognise, by a blind instinct like that which, when
we are walking, sets one foot before the other, without giving us time
to think what we are doing, then at once it became as though she and the
little girl who had inspired my dreams had been two differen

t people.
if, for instance, i had retained in my memory overnight two fiery eyes
above plump and rosy cheeks, gilberte's face would now offer me (and
with emphasis) something that i distinctly had not remembered, a
certain sharpening and prolongation of the nose which, instantaneously
associating itself with certain others of her features, assumed the
importance of those characteristics which, in natural history, are used
to define a species, and transformed her into a little girl of the kind
that have sharpened profiles. while i was making myself ready to take
advantage of this long expected moment, and to sur

render myself to the
impression of gilberte which i had prepared beforehand but could no
longer find in my head, to an extent which would enable me, during the
long hours which i must spend alone, to be certain that it was indeed
herself whom i had in mind, that it was indeed my love for her that i
was gradually making grow, as a book grows when one is writing it, she
threw me a ball; and, like the idealist philosopher whose body takes
account of the external world in the reality of which his intellect

, made me,
out of politeness, until the time came when she had to i go, address
a thousand polite and trivial remarks to her, and so prevented me both
from keeping a silence in which i might at last have laid my hand upon
the indispensable, escaped idea, and from uttering the words which might
have made that definite progress in the course of our love on which i
was always obliged to count only for the following afternoon. there was,
however, an occasional development. one day, we had gone with gilberte
to the stall of our own special vendor, who was always particularly
nice to us, since it was to her that m. swann used to send for his
gingerbread, of which, for reasons of health (he suffered from a racial
eczema, and from the constipation of the prophets), he consumed a great
quantity,--gilberte pointed out to me with a laugh two little boys who
were like the little artist and the little naturalist in the children's
storybooks. for one of them would not have a red stick of rock because
he pre

ferred the purple, while the other, with tears in his eyes,
refused a plum which his nurse was buying for him, because, as he
finally explained in passionate tones: "i want the other plum; it's got
a worm in it!" i purchased two ha'penny marbles. with admiring eyes i
saw, luminous and imprisoned in a bowl by themselves, the agate marbles
which seemed precious to me because they were as fair and smiling as
little girls, and because they cost five-pence each. gilberte, who was
given a great deal more pocket money than i ever had, asked me which i
thought the prettiest. they were as transparent, as liquid-seeming as
life itself. i would not have had her sacrifice a single one of them.
i should have liked her to be able to buy them, to liberate them all.
still, i pointed out one that had the same colour as her eyes. gilberte
took it, turned it about until it shone with a ray of gold, fondled it,
paid its ransom, but at once handed me her captive, saying: "take

 it; it
is for you, i give it to you, keep it to remind yourself of me."

another time, being still obsessed by the desire to hear berma in
classic drama, i had asked her whether she had not a copy of a pamphlet
in which bergotte spoke of racine, and which was now out of print. she
had told me to let her know the exact title of it, and that evening
i had sent her a little telegram, writing on its envelope the name,
gilberte swann, which i had so often, traced in my exercise-books. next
day she brought me in a parcel tied with pink bows and sealed with white
wax, the pamphlet, a copy of which she had managed to find. "you see, it
is what you asked me for," she said, taking from her muff the telegram
that i had sent her. but in the address on the pneumatic message--which,
only yesterday, was nothing, was merely a 'little blue' that i had
written, and, after a messenger had delivered it to gilberte's porter
and a ser

 that she had
received in the course of the day--i had difficulty in recognising
the futile, straggling lines of my own handwriting beneath the circles
stamped on it at the post-office, the inscriptions added in pencil by
a postman, signs of effectual realisation, seals of the external world,
violet bands symbolical of life itself, which for the first time came to
espouse, to maintain, to raise, to rejoice my dream.

and there was another day on which she said to me: "you know, you may
call me 'gilberte'; in any case, i'm going to call you by your first
name. it's too silly not to." yet she continued for a while to address
me by the more formal '_vous_,' and, when i drew her attention to this,
smiled, and composing, constructing a phrase like those that are put
into the grammar-books of foreign languages with no other object than to
teach us to make use of a new word, ended it with my christian name. and
when i recalled, later, what i had felt at the time, i could distinguish
the impression of

adapting itself
to the same new degree of intimacy as her speech, fell on me also more
directly, not without testifying to the consciousness, the pleasure,
even the gratitude that it felt, accompanying itself with a smile.

but at that actual moment, i was not able to appreciate the worth of
these new pleasures. they were given, not by the little girl whom i
loved, to me who loved her, but by the other, her with whom i used to
play, to my other self, who possessed neither the memory of the true
gilberte, nor the fixed heart which alone could have known the value
of a happiness for which it alone had longed. even after i had returned
home i did not taste them, since, every day, the necessity which made
me hope that on the morrow i should arrive at the clear, calm, happy
contemplation of gilberte, that she would at last confess her love
for me, explaining to me the reasons by which she had been obliged,
hitherto, to conceal it, that same necessity forced me to regard the
past as of no account, t

 she had given me not in themselves and as if they were
self-sufficient, but like fresh rungs of the ladder on which i might
set my feet, which were going to allow me to advance a step further and
finally to attain the happiness which i had not yet encountered.

if, at times, she shewed me these marks of her affection, she troubled
me also by seeming not to be pleased to see me, and this happened often
on the very days on which i had most counted for the realisation of my
hopes. i was sure that gilberte was coming to the champs-elysées, and
i felt an elation which seemed merely the anticipation of a great
happiness when--going into the drawing-room in the morning to kiss
mamma, who was already dressed to go out, the coils of her black hair
elaborately built up, and her beautiful hands, plump and white, fragrant
still with soap--i had been apprised, by seeing a column of dust
standing by itself in the air above the piano, and by hearing a
barrel-organ playing, beneath the window, _en revenant

an invitation to the feast at which i could not myself arrive before
three o'clock, until the moment when françoise came to fetch me at the
school-gate, and we made our way towards the champs-elysées through
streets decorated with sunlight, dense with people, over which the
balconies, detached by the sun and made vaporous, seemed to float in
front of the houses like clouds of gold. alas! in the champs-elysées
i found no gilberte; she had not yet arrived. motionless, on the lawn
nurtured by the invisible sun which, here and there, kindled to a flame
the point of a blade of grass, while the pigeons that had alighted upon
it had the appearance of ancient sculptures which the gardener's pick
had heaved to the surface of a hallowed soil, i stood with my eyes fixed
on the horizon, expecting at every moment to see appear the form of
gilberte following that of her governess, behind the statue that
seemed to be holding out the

gratitude to the donor, the most becoming place upon her person. when
she had found it, she performed a circular movement with her neck,
straightened her boa, and fastened upon the collector, as she shewed
her the end of yellow paper that stuck out over her bare wrist, the
bewitching smile with which a woman says to a young man, pointing to her
bosom: "you see, i'm wearing your roses!"

i dragged françoise, on the way towards gilberte, as far as the arc
de triomphe; we did not meet her, and i was returning towards the lawn
convinced, now, that she was not coming, when, in front of the wooden
horses, the little girl with the sharp voice flung herself upon me:
"quick, quick, gilberte's been here a quarter of an hour. she's just
going. we've been waiting for you, to make up a prisoner's base."

while i had been going up the avenue des champs-elysées, gilberte had
arrived by the rue boissy-d'anglas, mademoiselle having taken ad

coming to fetch his daughter. and so it was my fault; i ought not to
have strayed from the lawn; for one never knew for certain from what
direction gilberte would appear, whether she would be early or late, and
this perpetual tension succeeded in making more impressive not only the
champs-elysées in their entirety, and the whole span of the afternoon,
like a vast expanse of space and time, on every point and at every
moment of which it was possible that the form of gilberte might appear,
but also that form itself, since behind its appearance i felt that there
lay concealed the reason for which it had shot its arrow into my heart

those occupations in which i might not follow gilberte, occupations
that forced her to go out or to stay at home, i was in contact with the
mystery of her unknown life. it was this mystery, too, which troubled
me when, running at the sharp-voiced girl's bidding, so as to begin our
game without more delay, i saw gilberte, so quick and informal with
us, make a ceremonious bow to the old lady with the _débats_ (who
acknowledged it with "what a lovely sun! you'd think there was a fire
burning.") speaking to her with a shy smile, with an air of constra

at home with her parents, or with friends of her parents, paying
visits, in all the rest, that escaped me, of her existence. but of that
existence no one gave me so strong an impression as did m. swann, who
came a little later to fetch his daughter. that was because he and mme.
swann--inasmuch as their daughter lived with them, as her lessons,
her games, her friendships depended upon them--contained for me, like
gilberte, perhaps even more than gilberte, as befitted subjects that had
an all-powerful control over her in whom it must have had its source, an
undefined, an inaccessible quality of melancholy charm. everything that
concerned them was on my part the object of so constant a preoccupation
that the days on which, as on this day, m. swann (whom i had seen so
often, long ago, without his having aroused my curiosity, when he
was still on good terms with my parents) came for gilberte to the

as if no one else had ever known the house of orleans; they set him
in vivid detachment against the vulgar background of pedestrians
of different classes, who encumbered that particular path in the
champs-elysées, in the midst of whom i admired his condescending to
figure without claiming any special deference, which as it happened none
of them dreamed of paying him, so profound was the incognito in which he
was wrapped.

he responded politely to the salutations of gilberte's companions, even
to mine, for all that he was no longer on good terms with my family,
but without appearing to know who i was. (this reminded me that he had
constantly seen me in the country; a memory which i had retained, but
kept out of sight, because, since i had seen gilberte again, swann had
become to me pre-eminently her father, and no longer the combray swann;

thread, secondary and transversal, to our former guest; and as nothing
had any longer any value for me save in the extent to which my love
might profit by it, it was with a spasm of shame and of regret at not
being able to erase them from my memory that i recaptured the years in
which, in the eyes of this same swann who was at this moment before me
in the champs-elysées, and to whom, fortunately, gilberte had perhaps
not mentioned my name, i had so often, in the evenings, made myself
ridiculous by sending to ask mamma to come upstairs to my room to say
good-night to me, while she was drinking coffee with him and my father
and my grandparents at the table in the garden.) he told gilberte that
she might play one game; he could wait for a quarter of an hour; and,

the monotony of the stone, and with an attribute which, when the goddess
bears it, entitles her to a particular epithet and makes of her, as a
different christian name makes of a mortal, a fresh divinity.

on one of these sunny days which had not realised my hopes, i had not
the courage to conceal my disappointment from gilberte.

"i had ever so many things to ask you," i said to her; "i thought that
to-day was going to mean so much in our friendship. and no sooner have
you come than you go away! try to come early to-morrow, so that i can
talk to you."

her face lighted up and she jumped for joy as she answered: "tomorrow,
you may make up your mind, my dear friend, i sha'n't come!

"first of all i've a big luncheon-party; then in the afternoon i
am going to a friend's house to see king theodosius arrive from her
window

i returned home with françoise through streets that were still gay with
sunshine, as on the evening of a holiday when the merriment is over. i
could scarcely drag my legs along.

"i'm not surprised;" said françoise, "it's not the right weather for the
time of year; it's much too warm. oh dear, oh dear, to think of all
the poor sick people there must be everywhere; you would think that up
there, too, everything's got out of order."

i repeated to myself, stifling my sobs, the words in which gilberte had
given utterance to her joy at the prospect of not coming back, for a
long time, to the champs-elysées. but already the charm with which, by
the mere act of thinking, my mind was filled as soon as it thought of
her, the privileged position, unique even if it were painful, in which
i was inevitably placed in relation to gilberte by the contraction of a
scar in my mind, had begun to add to that very mark of her indifference
something romantic, and in the midst of my tears my lips would shape

themselves in a smile which was indeed the timid outline of a kiss. and
when the time came for the postman i said to myself, that evening as on
every other: "i am going to have a letter from gilberte, she is going to
tell me, at last, that she has never ceased to love me, and to explain
to me the mysterious reason by which she has been forced to conceal her
love from me until now, to put on the appearance of being able to be
happy without seeing me; the reason for which she has assumed the form
of the other gilberte, who is simply a companion."

every evening i would beguile myself into imagining this letter,
believing that i was actually reading it, reciting each of its sentences
in turn. 
 
 ___________________________
 
suddenly i would stop, in alarm. i had realised that, if i was
to receive a letter from gilberte, it could not, in any case, be this
letter, since it was i myself who had just composed it. and from that
moment i would strive to keep my thoughts clear of the words which i
should have liked her to write to me, from fear lest, by first selecting
them myself, i should be excluding just those identical words,--the
dearest, the most desired--from the field of possible events. even if,
by an almost impossible coincidence, it had been precisely the letter
of my invention that gilberte had addresse

d to me of her own accord,
recognising my own work in it i should not have had the impression that
i was receiving something that had not originated in myself, something
real, something new, a happiness external to my mind, independent of my
will, a gift indeed from love.

while i waited i read over again a page which, although it had not been
written to me by gilberte, came to me, none the less, from her, that
page by bergotte upon the beauty of the old myths from which racine
drew his inspiration, which (with the agate marble) i always kept within
reach. i was touched by my friend's kindness in having procured the book
for me; and as everyone is obliged to find some reason for his passion,
so much so that he is glad to find in the creature whom he loves
qualities which (he has learned by reading or in conversation) are
worthy to excite a man's love, that he

 assimilates them by imitation
and makes out of them fresh reasons for his love, even although these
qualities be diametrically opposed to those for which his love would
have sought, so long as it was spontaneous--as swann, before my day, had
sought to establish the aesthetic basis of odette's beauty--i, who had
at first loved gilberte, in combray days, on account of all the unknown
element in her life into which i would fain have plunged headlong, have
undergone reincarnation, discarding my own separate existence as a thing
that no longer mattered, i thought now, as of an inestimable advantage,
that of this, my own, my too familiar, my contemptible existence
gilberte might one day become the humble servant, the kindly, the
comforting collaborator, who in the evenings, helping me in my work,
would collate for me the texts of

rare pamphlets. as for bergotte, that
infinitely wise, almost divine old man, because of whom i had first,
before i had even seen her, loved gilberte, now it was for gilberte's
sake, chiefly, that i loved him. with as much pleasure as the pages that
he had written about racine, i studied the wrapper, folded under great
seals of white wax and tied with billows of pink ribbon, in which she
had brought those pages to me. i kissed the agate marble, which was
the better part of my love's heart, the part that was not frivolous but
faithful, and, for all that it was adorned with the mysterious charm of
gilberte's life, dwelt close beside me, inhabited my chamber, shared my

bed. but the beauty of that stone, and the beauty also of those pages
of bergotte which i was glad to associate with the idea of my love for
gilberte, as if, in the moments when my love seemed no longer to have
any existence, they gave it a kind of consistency, were, i perceived,
anterior to that love, which they in no way resembled; their elements
had been determined by the writer's talent, or by geological laws,
before ever gilberte had known me, nothing in book or stone would have
been different if gilberte had not loved me, and there was nothing,
consequently, that authorised me to read in them a message of happiness.
and while my love, incessantly waiting for the morrow to bring a
confession of gilberte's love for me, destroyed, unravelled every
evening, the ill-done work of the day, in some shadowed part of my being
was an unknown weaver who would not leave where they lay the severed
threads, but collected and rearrang

ed them, without any thought of
pleasing me, or of toiling for my advantage, in the different order
which she gave to all her handiwork. without any special interest in my
love, not beginning by deciding that i was loved, she placed, side by
side, those of gilberte's actions that had seemed to me inexplicable and
her faults which i had excused. then, one with another, they took on
a meaning. it seemed to tell me, this new arrangement, that when i saw
gilberte, instead of coming to me in the champs-elysées, going to a
party, or on errands with her governess, when i saw her prepared for
an absence that would extend over the new year holidays, i was wrong in
thinking, in saying: "it is because she is frivolous," or "easily lead."
for she would have ceased to be either if she had loved me, and if she
had been forced to obey it would have been with the same despair in
her heart that i felt on the days when i did not see her. it shewed me
further, this n

ew arrangement, that i ought, after all, to know what
it was to love, since i loved gilberte; it drew my attention to the
constant anxiety that i had to 'shew off' before her, by reason of which
i tried to persuade my mother to get for françoise a waterproof coat and
a hat with a blue feather, or, better still, to stop sending with me to
the champs-elysées an attendant with whom i blushed to be seen (to all
of which my mother replied that i was not fair to françoise, that
she was an excellent woman and devoted to us all) and also that sole,
exclusive need to see gilberte, the result

 of which was that, months in
advance, i could think of nothing but how to find out at what date she
would be leaving paris and where she was going, feeling that the most
attractive country in the world would be but a place of exile if she
were not to be there, and asking only to be allowed to stay for ever
in paris, so long as i might see her in the champs-elysées; and it had
little difficulty in making me see that neither my anxiety nor my
need could be justified by anything in gilberte's conduct. she, on the
contrary, was genuinely fond of her governess, without troubling herself
over what i might choose to think about it. it seemed quite natural to
her not to come to the champs-elysées if she had to go shopping with
mademoiselle, delightful if she had to go out somewhere with her mother.
and even supposing that she would ever have allowed me to spend my
holidays in the same place as herself, when it came to choosing
that place she considered her parents' wishes, a thousand

seen weaver,
that, if we find ourselves hoping that the actions of a person who has
hitherto caused us anxiety may prove not to have been sincere, they shed
in their wake a light which our hopes are powerless to extinguish, a
light to which, rather than to our hopes, we must put the question, what
will be that person's actions on the morrow.

these new counsels, my love listened and heard them; they persuaded it
that the morrow would not be different from all the days that had gone
before; that gilberte's feeling for me, too long established now to
be capable of alteration, was indifference; that in my friendship with
gilberte, it was i alone who loved. "that is true," my love responded,
"there is nothing more to be made of that friendship. it will not alter
now." and so the very next day (unless i were to wait for a public
holiday, if there was one approaching, some anniversary, the new year,
perhaps, one of those days which are not like other days, on which time
starts afresh, casting aside

the heritage of the past, declining its
legacy of sorrows) i would appeal to gilberte to terminate our old and
to join me in laying the foundations of a new friendship.

* * *

i had always, within reach, a plan of paris, which, because i could see
drawn on it the street in which m. and mme. swann lived, seemed to me to
contain a secret treasure. and to please myself, as well as by a sort
of chivalrous loyalty, in any connection or with no relevance at all, i
would repeat the name of that street until my father, not being, like
my mother and grandmother, in the secret of my love

 for ever present in my mind, which could not, however, grow
accustomed to it. i analysed it, i spelt it; its orthography came to me
as a surprise. and with its familiarity it had simultaneously lost its
innocence. the pleasure that i derived from the sound of it i felt to
be so guilty, that it seemed to me as though the others must read my
thoughts, and would change the conversation if i endeavoured to guide it
in that direction. i fell back upon subjects which still brought me into
touch with gilberte, i eternally repeated the same words, and it was no
use my knowing that they were but words--words uttered in her absence,
which she could not hear, words without virtue in themselves, repeating
what were, indeed, facts, but powerless to modify them--for still
it seemed to me that by dint of handling, of stirring in this way
everything that had reference to gilberte, i might perhaps make emerge
from it something that would bring me happiness. i told my parents again
that gilberte was very fond

of her governess, as if the statement, when
repeated for the hundredth time, would at last have the effect of making
gilberte suddenly burst into the room, come to live with us for ever.
i had already sung the praises of the old lady who read the _débats_
(i had hinted to my parents that she must at least be an ambassador's
widow, if not actually a highness) and i continued to descant on her
beauty, her splendour, her nobility, until the day on which i mentioned
that, by what i had heard gilberte call her, she appeared to be a mme.
blatin.

"oh, now i know whom you mean," cried my mother, while i felt myself
grow red all over with shame. "on guard! on guard!--as your grandfather
says. and so it's she that you think so wonderful? why, she's perfectly
horrible, and always has been. she's the widow of a bailiff. you can't
remember, when you were little, all the trouble i used to have to avoid
her at your gymnastic lessons, where she was always trying to get hold

ly by the words: "by the way, guess whom i saw at the
trois quartiers--at the umbrella counter--swann!" caused to burst open
in the midst of her narrative (an arid desert to me) a mystic blossom.
what a melancholy satisfaction to learn that, that very afternoon,
threading through the crowd his supernatural form, swann had gone to
buy an umbrella. among the events of the day, great and small, but
all equally unimportant, that one alone aroused in me those peculiar
vibrations by which my love for gilberte was invariably stirred. my
father complained that i took no interest in anything, because i did not
listen while he was speaking of the political developments that might
follow the visit of king theodosius, at that moment in france as
the nation's guest and (it was hinted) ally. and yet how intensely
interested i was to know whether swann had been wearing his hooded cape!

"did you speak to him?" i asked.

"why, of course i did," answered my mother, who always seemed afraid
lest, were she to ad

ed, certain details of our past
life, all of which i myself perhaps did not know. but my mother did not
seem to have noticed anything particularly attractive in that counter at
the trois quartiers where she had represented to swann, at the moment
in which he caught sight of her, a definite person with whom he had
sufficient memories in common to impel him to come up to her and to
speak.

nor did either she or my father seem to find any occasion now to mention
swann's family, the grandparents of gilberte, nor to use the title of
stockbroker, topics than which nothing else gave me so keen a pleasure.
my imagination had isolated and consecrated in the social paris a
certain family, just as it had set apart in the structural paris a
certain house, on whose porch it had fashioned sculptures and made its
windows precious. but these ornaments i alone had eyes to see. just as
my father and mother looked upon the house in which swann lived as one
that closely resembled the other houses built at the sam

s. their judgment was
more or less favourable according to the extent to which the family in
question shared in merits that were common to the rest of the universe,
and there was about it nothing that they could call unique. what, on the
other hand, they did appreciate in the swanns they found in equal, if
not in greater measure elsewhere. and so, after admitting that the house
was in a good position, they would go on to speak of some other house
that was in a better, but had nothing to do with gilberte, or of
financiers on a larger scale than her grandfather had been; and if they
had appeared, for a moment, to be of my opinion, that was a mistake
which was very soon corrected. for in order to distinguish in all
gilberte's surroundings an indefinable quality analogous, in the scale
of emotions, to what in the scale of colours is called infra-red, a
supplementary sense of perception was required, with which love, for the
time being, had endowed me; and this my parents lacked.

on the days when

gilberte had warned me that she would not be coming to
the champs-elysées, i would try to arrange my walks so that i should
be brought into some kind of contact with her. sometimes i would lead
françoise on a pilgrimage to the house in which the swanns lived, making
her repeat to me unendingly all that she had learned from the governess
with regard to mme. swann. "it seems, she puts great faith in medals.
she would never think of starting on a journey if she had heard an

at midnight, or if the furniture had creaked. oh yes! she's a most
religious lady, she is!" i was so madly in love with gilberte that if,
on our way, i caught sight of their old butler taking the dog out, my
emotion would bring me to a standstill, i would fasten on his white
whiskers eyes that melted with passion. and françoise would rouse me
with: "what's wrong with you now, child?" and we would continue on our
way until we reached their gate, where a porter, different from every
other porter in the world, and saturated, even to the braid on his
livery, with the same melancholy charm that i had felt to be latent in
the

 name of gilberte, looked at me as though he knew that i was one
of those whose natural unworthiness would for ever prevent them from
penetrating into the mysteries of the life inside, which it was his duty
to guard, and over which the ground-floor windows appeared conscious of
being protectingly closed, with far less resemblance, between the nobly
sweeping arches of their muslin curtains, to any other windows in the
world than to gilberte's glancing eyes. on other days we would go along
the boulevards, and i would post myself at the corner of the rue duphot;
i had heard that swann was often to be seen passing there, on his way
to the dentist's; and my imagination so far differentiated gilberte's
father from the rest of humanity, his presence in the midst of a crowd
of real people introduced among them so miraculous an element, that even
before we reached the madeleine i would be trembling with emotion at
the thought that i was a

pproaching a street from which that supernatural
apparition might at any moment burst upon me unawares.

but most often of all, on days when i was not to see gilberte, as i
had heard that mme. swann walked almost every day along the allée des
acacias, round the big lake, and in the allée de la reine marguerite, i
would guide françoise in the direction of the bois de boulogne. it was
to me like one of those zoological gardens in which one sees assembled
together a variety of flora, and contrasted effects in landscape; where
from a hill one passes to a grotto, a meadow, rocks, a stream, a trench,
another hill, a marsh, but knows that they are there only to

laws into the knowledge of which they had been initiated, and that they
had the power to realise it, i accepted before seeing them, like the
truth of a coming revelation, the appearance of their clothes, of their
carriages and horses, of a thousand details among which i placed my
faith as in an inner soul which gave the cohesion of a work of art to
that ephemeral and changing pageant. but it was mme. swann whom i wished
to see, and i waited for her to go past, as deeply moved as though
she were gilberte, whose parents, saturated, like everything in her
environment, with her own special charm, excited in me as keen a passion
as she did herself, indeed a still more painful disturbance (since their
point of contact with her was that intimate, that internal part of
her life which was hidden from me), and furthermore, for i very soon
learned, as we shall see in due course, that they did not like my
playing with her, that feeling of veneration which we always have for
those who hold, and exercise wi

h, to
whom they had not, so far, been paying the slightest attention, salute
(without knowing her, it was true, but i thought that i had sufficient
authority since my parents knew her husband and i was her daughter's
playmate) this woman whose reputation for beauty, for misconduct, and
for elegance was universal. but i was now close to mme. swann; i pulled
off my hat with so lavish, so prolonged a gesture that she could not
repress a smile. people laughed. as for her, she had never seen me with
gilberte, she did not know my name, but i was for her--like one of the
keepers in the bois, like the boatman, or the ducks on the lake, to
which she threw scraps of bread--one of the minor personages, familiar,
nameless, as devoid of individual character as a stage-hand in a
theatre, of her daily walks abroad.

on certain days when i had missed her in the allée des acacias i would
be so fortunate as to meet her in the allée de la reine marguerite,
where women went who wished to be alone, or to appear
