 "orderly!"
 dr. frame was standing in the door of the watch room; the paper disappeared into the man's
clothes. "coming, sir. i was just getting this tray."
 "what were you reading?"
 "nothing."
 "i saw you. never mind, come out of there quickly. this patient is not to be disturbed." the man
obeyed; dr. frame closed the door behind them. smith lay motionless for the next half hour, but try as he
might he could not grok it at all.

 gillian boardman was considered professionally competent as a nurse; she was
judged competent in wider fields by the bachelor internes and she was judged harshly by some other
women. there was no harm in her and her hobby was men. when the grapevine carried the word that
there was a patient in special suite k-12 who had never laid eyes on a woman in his life, she did not
believe it. when detailed explanation convinced her, she resolved to remedy it. she went on duty that
day as floor supervisor in the wing wher

y must know-else they would never have come here. that damned robo-cab must have
given her away.
 well, should she answer? or play 'possum?
 the shout over the announcing circuit was repeated. she whispered to smith, "stay here!" then
went into the living room. "who is it?" she called out, striving to keep her voice normal.
 "open in the name of the law!"
 "open in the name of what law? don't be silly. tell me who you are and what you want before i
call the police."
 "we are the police. are you gillian boardman?"
 "me? of course not. i'm phyllis o'toole and i'm waiting for mr. caxton to come home. now
you had better go away, because i'm going to call the police and report an invasion of privacy."
 "miss boardman, we have a warrant for your arrest. open up at once or it will go hard with
you."

 the voice did not answer. jill waited, swallowing. shortly she felt radian

haw was not. he continued his usual routine of aimless loafing, varied only
by casual and unplanned observation of his laboratory animal, the man from mars. he arranged no
schedule for smith, no programme of study, no regular physical examinations, but simply allowed smith
to do as he pleased, run wild, like a puppy growing up on a ranch. what supervision smith received
came from jill: more than enough, in jubal's grumpy opinions as he took a dim view of males being reared
by females.
 however, gillian boardman did little more than coach valentine smith in the rudiments of human

social behavior-and he needed very little coaching. he ate at the table with the others now, dressed
himself (at least jubal thought he did; he made a mental note to ask jill if she still had to assist him); he
conformed acceptably to the household's very informal customs and appeared able to cope with most
new experiences on a "monkey~see~monkeyd0" b

 recited his pay number. one by one, the other six men who had left the car,
and at last the driver, went through the same rigamarole at heinrich's frozen-faced orders.
 when they were done, jubal said sweetly, "and now, captain heinrich, how may i help you?"
 "i have a search warrant here for gilbert berquist, which warrant names this property, its
buildings and grounds."
 "show it to me, then show it to the witness."
 "i will do so. but i have another search warrant, similar to the first, for gillian boardman."
 "who?"
 "gillian boardman. the charge is kidnapping."
 "my goodness!"
 "and another for hector c. johnson ... and one for valentine michael smith . . . and one for
you, jubal harshaw."
 "me? taxes again?"
 "no. look at it. accessory to this and that ... and material witness on some other things . . . and
i'd take you in on my own for obstructing justice if the warrant didn't make it unnecessary."
 "oh, come now, captain! i've been most cooperative since you identified yourself and started

smith-the real valentine michael smith, not the one who has appeared in the newscasts-escaped from
confinement-and, i should add, illegal confinement-at bethesda medical center on thursday last, in
company with nurse gillian boardman. he kept his freedom and is now free-and he will continue to
keep it. if any of your large staff of assistants has told you anything else, then someone has been lying to
you . . . which is why i am speaking to you yourself. so that you can straighten it out."

me the scenery flowing beneath him was a never-ending delight, and he was filled
with eagerness for experience to come. he expected, or hoped, to meet a human old one.
 senator tom boone was waiting to meet them at the landing flat. "howdy, folks! and may the
good lord bless you on this beautiful sabbath. mr. smith, i'm happy to see you again. and you, too,
doctor." he took his cigar out of his mouth and looked at jill. "and this little lady- didn't i see you at the
palace?"
 "yes, senator. i'm gillian boardman."
 "thought so, m'dear. are you saved?"
 "uh, i guess not, senator."
 "well, it's never too late. we'll be very happy to have you attend the seekers' service in the outer
tabernacle-i'll find a guardian to guide you. mr. smith and the doc will be going into the sanctuary, of
course." the senator looked around.
 "senator-"
 "uh, what, doc?"
 "if miss boardmnan can't go into the sanctuary, i think we had all better attend the seekers'
service. she's his nurse and translator."
