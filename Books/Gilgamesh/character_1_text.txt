writing and the internal evidence showed, from the hammurabi period,
which undoubtedly is a portion of what by way of distinction we may
call an old babylonian version. [8] it was picked up by dr. meissner
at a dealer's shop in bagdad and acquired for the berlin museum. the
tablet consists of four columns (two on the obverse and two on the
reverse) and deals with the hero's wanderings in search of a cure
from disease with which he has been smitten after the death of his
companion enkidu. the hero fears that the disease will be fatal and
longs to escape death. it corresponds to a portion of tablet x of
the assyrian version. unfortunately, only the lower portion of the
obverse and the upper of the reverse have been preserved (57 lines
in all); and in default of a colophon we do not know the numeration
of the tablet in this old babylonian edition. its chief value,
apart from its furnishing a proof for the existence of the epic
as early as 2000 b. c., lies (a) in the writin

description of the weapons of gilgamesh with which he arms himself
for an encounter--presumably the encounter with humbaba or huwawa,
the ruler of the cedar forest in the mountain. [14] the latter deals
with the building operations of gilgamesh in the city of erech. a
text in zimmern's _sumerische kultlieder aus altbabylonischer zeit_
(leipzig, 1913), no. 196, appears likewise to be a fragment of the
sumerian version of the gilgamesh epic, bearing on the episode of
gilgamesh's and enkidu's relations to the goddess ishtar, covered in
the sixth and seventh tablets of the assyrian version. [15]

until, however, further fragments shall have turned up, it would
be hazardous to institute a comparison between the sumerian and the
akkadian versions. all that can be said for the present is that there
is every reason to believe in the existence of a literary form of the
epic in sumerian which presumably antedated the akkadian recension,
just as we have a sumerian form of ishtar's

the sumerians in their earliest home before they came to the euphrates
valley. they may have adopted it after their conquest of southern
babylonia from the semites who, there are now substantial grounds for
believing, were the earlier settlers in the euphrates valley. [18]
we must distinguish, therefore, between the earliest _literary_ form,
which was undoubtedly sumerian, and the _origin_ of the episodes
embodied in the epic, including the chief actors, gilgamesh and his
companion enkidu. it will be shown that one of the chief episodes,
the encounter of the two heroes with a powerful guardian or ruler
of a cedar forest, points to a western region, more specifically to
amurru, as the scene. the names of the two chief actors, moreover,
appear to have been "sumerianized" by an artificial process, [19]
and if this view turns out to be correct, we would have a further
ground for assuming the tale to have originated among the akkadian
settlers and to have been taken over from

their conflict, followed by their reconciliation, while the yale

the two heroes with the guardian of the cedar forest, humbaba--but
probably pronounced hubaba [27]--or, as the name appears in the old
babylonian version, huwawa. the two tablets correspond, therefore,
to portions of tablets i to v of the assyrian version; [28] but,
as will be shown in detail further on, the number of _completely_

t may be said that the assyrian
version is more elaborate, which points to its having received its
present form at a considerably later period than the old babylonian
version. [29] on the other hand, we already find in the babylonian
version the tendency towards repetition, which is characteristic
of babylonian-assyrian tales in general. through the two babylonian
tablets we are enabled to fill out certain details of the two episodes
with which they deal: (1) the meeting of gilgamesh and enkidu, and
(2) the encounter with huwawa; while their greatest value consists
in the light that they throw on the gradual growth of the epic until
it reached its definite form in the text represented by the fragments
in ashurbanapal's library. let us now take up the detailed analysis,
first of the pennsylvania tablet and then of the yale tablet. the
pennsylvania tablet begins with two dreams recounted by gilgamesh
to his mother, which the latter interprets as presaging the coming
of enkidu to

d almost crushes him. with the help of
the heroes of erech, gilgamesh carries the heavy burden to his mother
ninsun. the burden, his mother explains, symbolizes some one who,
like gilgamesh, is born in the mountains, to whom all will pay homage
and of whom gilgamesh will become enamoured with a love as strong as
that for a woman. in a second dream, gilgamesh sees some one who is
like him, who brandishes an axe, and with whom he falls in love. this
personage, the mother explains, is again enkidu.

langdon is of the opinion that these dreams are recounted to
enkidu by a woman with whom enkidu cohabits for six days and seven
nights and who weans enkidu from association with animals. this,
however, cannot be correct. the scene between enkidu and the woman
must have been recounted in detail in the first tablet, as in the
assyrian version, [30] whereas here in the second tablet we have the
continuation of the tale with gilgamesh recounting his dreams directly
to his mother. the sto

ry then continues with the description of the
coming of enkidu, conducted by the woman to the outskirts of erech,
where food is given him. the main feature of the incident is the
conversion of enkidu to civilized life. enkidu, who hitherto had
gone about naked, is clothed by the woman. instead of sucking milk
and drinking from a trough like an animal, food and strong drink are
placed before him, and he is taught how to eat and drink in human
fashion. in human fashion he also becomes drunk, and his "spree" is
naïvely described: "his heart became glad and his face shone." [31]
like an animal, enkidu's body had hitherto been covered with hair,
which is now shaved off. he is anointed with oil, and clothed "like

a man." enkidu becomes a shepherd, protecting the fold against wild
beasts, and his exploit in dispatching lions is briefly told. at this
point--the end of column 3 (on the obverse), i.e., line 117, and the
beginning of column 4 (on the reverse), i.e., line 131--a gap of 13
lines--the tablet is obscure, but apparently the story of enkidu's
gradual transformation from savagery to civilized life is continued,
with stress upon his introduction to domestic ways with the wife
chosen or decreed for him, and with work as part of his fate. all
this has no connection with gilgamesh, and it is evident that the
tale of enkidu was originally an _independent_ tale to illustrate the
evolution of man's career and destiny, how through intercourse with
a woman he awakens to the sense of human dignity, how he becomes
accustomed to the wa

ys of civilization, how he passes through the
pastoral stage to higher walks of life, how the family is instituted,
and how men come to be engaged in the labors associated with human
activities. in order to connect this tale with the gilgamesh story,
the two heroes are brought together; the woman taking on herself,
in addition to the rôle of civilizer, that of the medium through
which enkidu is brought to gilgamesh. the woman leads enkidu from
the outskirts of erech into the city itself, where the people on
seeing him remark upon his likeness to gilgamesh. he is the very
counterpart of the latter, though somewhat smaller in stature. there
follows the encounter between the two heroes in the streets of erech,
where they engage in a fierce combat. gilgamesh is overcome by enkidu
and is enraged at being thrown to the ground. the tablet closes with
the endeavor of enkidu to pacify gilgamesh. enkidu declares that the

 the main episode
in the yale tablet, which, therefore, forms the third tablet of the
old babylonian version.

in the first column of the obverse of the yale tablet, which is badly
preserved, it would appear that the elders of erech (or perhaps the
people) are endeavoring to dissuade gilgamesh from making the attempt
to penetrate to the abode of huwawa. if this is correct, then the
close of the first column may represent a conversation between these
elders and the woman who accompanies enkidu. it would be the elders
who are represented as "reporting the speech to the woman," which is
presumably the determination of gilgamesh to fight huwawa. the elders
apparently desire enkidu to accompany gilgamesh in this perilous
adventure, and with this in view appeal to the woman. in the second
column after an obscure reference to the mother of gilgamesh--perhaps
appealing to the sun-god--we find gilgamesh and enkidu again face to
face. from the reference to enkidu's eyes "filled with te

ars," we may
conclude that he is moved to pity at the thought of what will happen to
gilgamesh if he insists upon carrying out his purpose. enkidu, also,
tries to dissuade gilgamesh. this appears to be the main purport of
the dialogue between the two, which begins about the middle of the
second column and extends to the end of the third column. enkidu
pleads that even his strength is insufficient,


	"my arms are lame,
	my strength has become weak." (lines 88-89)


gilgamesh apparently asks for a description of the terrible tyrant
who thus arouses the fear of enkidu, and in reply enkidu tells
him how at one time, when he was roaming about with the cattle, he
penetrated into the forest and heard the roar of huwawa which was
like that of a deluge. the mouth of the tyrant emitted fire, and his
breath was death. it is clear, as prof

essor haupt has suggested, [32]
that enkidu furnishes the description of a volcano in eruption, with
its mighty roar, spitting forth fire and belching out a suffocating
smoke. gilgamesh is, however, undaunted and urges enkidu to accompany
him in the adventure.

"i will go down to the forest," says gilgamesh, if the conjectural
restoration of the line in question (l. 126) is correct. enkidu replies
by again drawing a lurid picture of what will happen "when we go
(together) to the forest......." this speech of enkidu is continued on
the reverse. in reply gilgamesh emphasizes his reliance upon the good
will of shamash and reproaches enkidu with cowardice. he declares
himself superior to enkidu's warning, and in bold terms says that
he prefers to perish in the attempt to overcome huwawa rather than
abandon it.


	"wherever terror is to be faced,

 away,

they try to frighten gilgamesh by repeating the description of
the terrible huwawa. gilgamesh is still undaunted and prays to his
patron deity shamash, who apparently accords him a favorable "oracle"
(_têrtu_). the two heroes arm themselves for the fray, and the elders
of erech, now reconciled to the perilous undertaking, counsel gilgamesh
to take provision along for the undertaking. they urge gilgamesh to
allow enkidu to take the lead, for


	"he is acquainted with the way, he has trodden the road
	[to] the entrance of the forest." (lines 252-253)


the elders dismiss gilgamesh with fervent wishes that enkidu may track
out the "closed path" for gilgamesh, and commit him to the care of
lugalbanda--here perhaps an epithet of shamash. they advise gilgamesh
to perform certain rites, to wash his feet in the stream of huwawa and
to pour out a libation of water to shamash. enkidu follows in a speech

lucian, _de dea syria_, § 19, the name kombabos
[40] (the guardian of stratonika), which forms a perfect parallel to
hu(m)baba. of the important bearings of this western character of the
name huwawa on the interpretation and origin of the gilgamesh epic,
suggesting that the episode of the encounter between the tyrant and
the two heroes rests upon a tradition of an expedition against the
west or amurru land, we shall have more to say further on.

the variation in the writing of the name enkidu is likewise
interesting. it is evident that the form in the old babylonian
version with the sign du (i.e., dúg) is the original, for it furnishes
us with a suitable etymology "enki is good." the writing with dúg,
pronounced du, also shows that the sign dú as the third element in the
form which the name has in the assyrian version is to be read dú, and
that former readings like ea-bani must be definitely abandoned. [41]
the form with dú is clearly a _phonetic_ writing of the sumerian

 name,
the sign dú being chosen to indicate the _pronunciation_ (not the
ideograph) of the third element dúg. this is confirmed by the writing
en-gi-dú in the syllabary _ct_ xviii, 30, 10. the phonetic writing
is, therefore, a warning against any endeavor to read the name by
an akkadian transliteration of the signs. this would not of itself
prove that enkidu is of sumerian _origin_, for it might well be that
the writing en-ki-dú is an endeavor to give a sumerian _aspect_ to
a name that _may_ have been foreign. the element dúg corresponds to
the semitic _tâbu_, "good," and en-ki being originally a designation
of a deity as the "lord of the land," which would be the sumerian
manner of indicating a semitic baal, it is not at all impossible
that en-ki-dúg may be the "sumerianized" form of a semitic ba`l tzob

ed that in the third column of the
yale tablet, enkidu speaks of himself in his earlier period while
still living with cattle, as wandering into the cedar forest of
huwawa, while in another passage (ll. 252-253) he is described as
"acquainted with the way ... to the entrance of the forest." this
would clearly point to the west as the original home of enkidu. we
are thus led once more to amurru--taken as a general designation of
the west--as playing an important role in the gilgamesh epic. [42] if
gilgamesh's expedition against huwawa of the lebanon district recalls
a babylonian campaign against amurru, enkidu's coming from his home,
where, as we read repeatedly in the assyrian version,


	"he ate herbs with the gazelles,

may rest on a tradition of an amorite invasion of babylonia. the

between gilgamesh and enkidu would fit in with this tradition,
while the subsequent reconciliation would be the form in which the
tradition would represent the enforced union between the invaders
and the older settlers.

leaving this aside for the present, let us proceed to a consideration
of the relationship of the form dgish, for the chief personage
in the epic in the old babylonian version, to dgish-gi(n)-mash in
the assyrian version. of the meaning of gish there is fortunately
no doubt. it is clearly the equiv

the pronunciation of which is not definite but approximate, and which
is written in various ways, the probabilities are that the name is
foreign. a foreign name might naturally be spelled in various ways. the
epic in the assyrian version clearly depicts dgish-gì(n)-mash as a
conqueror of erech, who forces the people into subjection, and whose
autocratic rule leads the people of erech to implore the goddess
aruru to create a rival to him who may withstand him. in response
to this appeal denkidu is formed out of dust by aruru and eventually
brought to erech. [47] gish-gì(n)-mash or gilgamesh is therefore in
all probability a foreigner; and the simplest solution suggested by the
existence of the two forms (1) gish in the old babylonian version and
(2) gish-gì(n)-mash in the assyrian version, is to regard the former
as an abbreviation, which seemed appropriate, because the short name
conveyed the idea of the "hero" _par excellence_. if gish-gì(n)-mash
is a foreign name, one wou

ames like ga-lu-mu-um, zu-ga-gi-ib,
ar-pi, e-ta-na, [63] which are distinctly foreign, while such names as
en-me(n)-nun-na and bar-sal-nun-na strike one again as "sumerianized"
names rather than as genuine sumerian formations. [64]

some of these names, as galumum, arpi and etana, are so amoritic
in appearance, that one may hazard the conjecture of their western
origin. may gilgamesh likewise belong to the amurru [65] region, or
does he represent a foreigner from the east in contrast to enkidu,
whose name, we have seen, may have been baal-tôb in the west, with
which region he is according to the epic so familiar? it must be
confessed that the second element _ga-mesh_ would fit in well with
a semitic origin for the name, for the element impresses one as
the participial form of a semitic stem g-m-s, just as in the second
element of meskin-gaser we have such a form. gil might then be the
name of a west-semitic deity. such conjectures, however, can for the
present not be substan

the form which comes closest to the real name, points to a foreign
origin for the hero, and that such forms as dgish-bil-ga-mesh and
dgish-bíl-gi-mesh and other variants are "sumerianized" forms for which
an artificial etymology was brought forward to convey the idea of the
"original hero" or the hero _par excellence_. by means of this "play"
on the name, which reverts to the compilers of the sumerian version
of the epic, gilgamesh was converted into a sumerian figure, just as
the name enkidu may have been introduced as a sumerian translation
of his amoritic name. dgish at all events is an abbreviated form of
the "sumerianized" name, introduced by the compilers of the earliest
akkadian version, which was produced naturally under the influence
of the sumerian version. later, as the epic continued to grow, a
phonetic writing was introduced, dgish-gi-mash, which is in a measure
a compromise between the genuine name and the "sumerianized" form,
but at the same time an _approach_

to the real pronunciation.



vi.


next to the new light thrown upon the names and original character
of the two main figures of the epic, one of the chief points of
interest in the pennsylvania fragment is the proof that it furnishes
for a striking resemblance of the two heroes, gish and enkidu, to one
another. in interpreting the dream of gish, his mother. ninsun, lays
stress upon the fact that the dream portends the coming of someone
who is like gish, "born in the field and reared in the mountain"
(lines 18-19). both, therefore, are shown by this description to
have come to babylonia from a mountainous region, i.e., they are
foreigners; and in the case of enkidu we have seen that the mountain
in all probability refers to a region in the west, while the same may
also be the c
 
 ___________________________
 
ase with gish. the resemblance of the two heroes to one
another extends to their personal appearance. when enkidu appears on
the streets of erech, the people are struck by this resemblance. they
remark that he is "like gish," though "shorter in stature" (lines
179-180). enkidu is described as a rival or counterpart. [66]

this relationship between the two is suggested also by the assyrian
version. in the creation of enkidu by aruru, the people urge the
goddess to create the "counterpart" (_zikru_) of gilgamesh, someone who
will be like him (_ma-si-il_) (tablet i, 2, 31). enkidu not only comes
from the mountain, [67] but the mountain is specifically designated as
his birth-place (i, 4, 2), precisely as in the pennsylvania tablet,
while in another passage he is also described, as in our tablet, as
"born in the field." [68] still more significant is the designation of
gilgamesh as the _talimu_, "younger broth
 
 ___________________________
 
er," of enkidu. [69] in accord
with this, we find gilgamesh in his lament over enkidu describing
him as a "younger brother" (_ku-ta-ni_); [70] and again in the last
tablet of the epic, gilgamesh is referred to as the "brother" of
enkidu. [71] this close relationship reverts to the sumerian version,
for the constantinople fragment (langdon, above, p. 13) begins with the
designation of gish-bil-ga-mesh as "his brother." by "his" no doubt
enkidu is meant. likewise in the sumerian text published by zimmern
(above, p. 13) gilgamesh appears as the brother of enkidu (rev. 1, 17).

turning to the numerous representations of gilgamesh and enkidu on
seal cylinders, [72] we find this resemblance of the two heroes to each
other strikingly confirmed. both are represented as bearded, with the
strands arranged in the same fashion. the face in both cases is broad,
with curls protruding at the side of the head, though at times these
curls ar

e lacking in the case of enkidu. what is particularly striking
is to find gilgamesh generally _a little taller_ than enkidu, thus
bearing out the statement in the pennsylvania tablet that enkidu is
"shorter in stature." there are, to be sure, also some distinguishing
marks between the two. thus enkidu is generally represented with
animal hoofs, but not always. [73] enkidu is commonly portrayed with
the horns of a bison, but again this sign is wanting in quite a number
of instances. [74] the hoofs and the horns mark the period when enkidu
lived with animals and much like an animal. most remarkable, however,
of all are cylinders on which we find the two heroes almost exactly
alike as, for example, ward no. 199 where two figures, the one a
duplicate of the other (except that one is just a shade taller), are in
conflict with each other. dr. ward was puzzled b

blet as alike, one the counterpart of the other,
the seal cylinder portrays them almost exactly alike, as alike as two
brothers could possibly be; with just enough distinction to make it
clear on close inspection that two figures are intended and not one
repeated for the sake of symmetry. there are slight variations in the
manner in which the hair is worn, and slightly varying expressions
of the face, just enough to make it evident that the one is intended
for gilgamesh and the other for enkidu. when, therefore, in another
specimen, no. 173, we find a gilgamesh holding his counterpart by the
legs, it is merely another aspect of the fight between the two heroes,
one of whom is intended to represent enkidu, and not, as dr. ward
supposed, a grotesque repetition of gilgamesh. [75]

the description of enkidu in the pennsylvania tablet as a parallel
figure to gilgamesh leads us to a consideration of the relationship
of the two figures to one another. many years ago it was pointed
o
 
 ___________________________
 
ut that the gilgamesh epic was a composite tale in which various
stories of an independent origin had been combined and brought into
more or less artificial connection with the _heros eponymos_ of
southern babylonia. [76] we may now go a step further and point out
that not only is enkidu originally an entirely independent figure,
having no connection with gish or gilgamesh, but that the latter is
really depicted in the epic as the counterpart of enkidu, a reflection
who has been given the traits of extraordinary physical power that
belong to enkidu. this is shown in the first place by the fact that
in the encounter it is enkidu who triumphs over gilgamesh. the entire
analysis of the episode of the meeting between the two heroes as given
by gressmann [77] must be revised. it is not enkidu who is terrified
and who is warned against the encounter. it is gilgamesh who, during
the night on his way from the house in which the goddess ishhara
 
 ___________________________
 

lies, encounters enkidu on the highway. enkidu "blocks the path"
[78] of gilgamesh. he prevents gilgamesh from re-entering the house,
[79] and the two attack each other "like oxen." [80] they grapple
with each other, and enkidu forces gilgamesh to the ground. enkidu
is, therefore, the real hero whose traits of physical prowess are
afterwards transferred to gilgamesh.

similarly in the next episode, the struggle against huwawa, the yale
tablet makes it clear that in the original form of the tale enkidu
is the real hero. all warn gish against the undertaking--the elders
of erech, enkidu, and also the workmen. "why dost thou desire to do
this?" [81] they say to him. "thou art young, and thy heart carries
thee away. thou knowest not what thou proposes
 
 ___________________________
 
t to do." [82] this part
of the incident is now better known to us through the latest fragment
of the assyrian version discovered and published by king. [83] the
elders say to gilgamesh:


	"do not trust, o gilgamesh, in thy strength!
	be warned(?) against trusting to thy attack!
	the one who goes before will save his companion, [84]
	he who has foresight will save his friend. [85]
	let enkidu go before thee.
	he knows the roads to the cedar forest;
	he is skilled in battle and has seen fight."


gilgamesh is sufficiently impressed by this warning to invite enkidu
to accompany him on a visit to his mother, ninsun, for the purpose
of receiving her counsel. [86]

it is only after enkidu, who himself hesitates and tries to dissuade
gish, decides to accompany the latter that the elders of erech
are reconciled and encourage gish for the fray. the two in concert
proceed against

 huwawa. gilgamesh alone cannot carry out the plan. now
when a tale thus associates two figures in one deed, one of the
two has been added to the original tale. in the present case there
can be little doubt that enkidu, without whom gish cannot proceed,
who is specifically described as "acquainted with the way ... to the
entrance of the forest" [87] in which huwawa dwells is the _original_
vanquisher. naturally, the epic aims to conceal this fact as much
as possible _ad majorem gloriam_ of gilgamesh. it tries to put the
one who became the favorite hero into the foreground. therefore, in
both the babylonian and the assyrian version enkidu is represented
as hesitating, and gilgamesh as determined to go a

head. gilgamesh,
in fact, accuses enkidu of cowardice and boldly declares that he
will proceed even though failure stare him in the face. [88] traces
of the older view, however, in which gilgamesh is the one for whom
one fears the outcome, crop out; as, for example, in the complaint of
gilgamesh's mother to shamash that the latter has stirred the heart
of her son to take the distant way to hu(m)baba,


	"to a fight unknown to him, he advances,
	an expedition unknown to him he undertakes." [89]


ninsun evidently fears the

consequences when her son informs her
of his intention and asks her counsel. the answer of shamash is not
preserved, but no doubt it was of a reassuring character, as was the
answer of the sun-god to gish's appeal and prayer as set forth in
the yale tablet. [90]

again, as a further indication that enkidu is the real conqueror of
huwawa, we find the coming contest revealed to enkidu no less than
three times in dreams, which gilgamesh interprets. [91] since the
person who dreams is always the one to whom the dream applies, we may
see in these dreams a further trace of the primary rôle originally
assigned to enkidu.

another exploit which, according to the assyrian version, the two
heroes perform in concert is the killing of a bull, sent by anu at
the instance of ishtar to avenge an insult offered to the goddess
by gilgamesh, who rejects her offer of marriage. in t

he fragmentary
description of the contest with the bull, we find enkidu "seizing"
the monster by "its tail." [92]

that enkidu originally played the part of the slayer is also shown
by the statement that it is he who insults ishtar by throwing a
piece of the carcass into the goddess' face, [93] adding also an
insulting speech; and this despite the fact that ishtar in her rage
accuses gilgamesh of killing the bull. [94] it is thus evident that
the epic alters the original character of the episodes in order to
find a place for gilgamesh, with the further desire to assign to the
latter the _chief_ rôle. be it note
 
 ___________________________
 
d also that enkidu, not gilgamesh,
is punished for the insult to ishtar. enkidu must therefore in the
original form of the episode have been the guilty party, who is
stricken with mortal disease as a punishment to which after twelve
days he succumbs. [95] in view of this, we may supply the name of
enkidu in the little song introduced at the close of the encounter
with the bull, and not gilgamesh as has hitherto been done.


	"who is distinguished among the heroes?
	who is glorious among men?
	[enkidu] is distinguished among heroes,
	[enkidu] is glorious among men." [96]


finally, the killing of lions is directly ascribed to enkidu in the
pennsylvania tablet:


	"lions he attacked
	*     *     *     *     *
	lions he overcame" [97]


whereas gilgamesh appe

ch
for utnapishtim he says:


	"on reaching the entrance of the mountain at night
	i saw lions and was afraid." [98]


he prays to sin and ishtar to protect and save him. when, therefore,
in another passage some one celebrates gilgamesh as the one who
overcame the "guardian," who dispatched hu(m)baba in the cedar forest,
who killed lions and overthrew the bull, [99] we have the completion
of the process which transferred to gilgamesh exploits and powers
which originally belonged to enkidu, though ordinarily the process
stops short at making gilgamesh a _sharer_ in the exploits; with the
natural tendency, to be sure, to enlarge the share of the favorite.

we can now understand why the two heroes are described in the
pennsylvania tablet as alike, as born in the same place, aye, as
brothers. gilgamesh in the epic is merely a reflex of enkidu. the
latter is the real hero and presumably, therefore, the older
figure. [100] gilgamesh resembles enkidu, because he _is_ originally
 
 ___________________________
 

enkidu. the "resemblance" _motif_ is merely the manner in which
in the course of the partly popular, partly literary transfer, the
recollection is preserved that enkidu is the original, and gilgamesh
the copy.

the artificiality of the process which brings the two heroes together
is apparent in the dreams of gilgamesh which are interpreted by
his mother as portending the coming of enkidu. not the conflict is
foreseen, but the subsequent close association, naïvely described as
due to the personal charm which enkidu exercises, which will lead
gilgamesh to fall in love with the one whom he is to meet. the two
will become one, like man and wife.

on the basis of our investigations, we are now in a position to
reconstruct in part the cycle of episodes that once formed part of
an enkidu epic. the fight between enkidu and gilgamesh, in which
the former is the victor, is typi

cal of the kind of tales told of
enkidu. he is the real prototype of the greek hercules. he slays
lions, he overcomes a powerful opponent dwelling in the forests of
lebanon, he kills the bull, and he finally succumbs to disease sent
as a punishment by an angry goddess. the death of enkidu naturally
formed the close of the enkidu epic, which in its original form may,
of course, have included other exploits besides those taken over into
the gilgamesh epic.



vii.


there is another aspect of the figure of enkidu which is brought
forward in the pennsylvania tablet more clearly than had hitherto been
the case. many years ago attention was called to certain striking
resemblances between enkidu and the figure of the first man as
described in the early chapters of genesis. [101] at that time we had
merely the a

ssyrian version of the gilgamesh epic at our disposal,
and the main point of contact was the description of enkidu living
with the animals, drinking and feeding like an animal, until a woman
is brought to him with whom he engages in sexual intercourse. this
suggested that enkidu was a picture of primeval man, while the
woman reminded one of eve, who when she is brought to adam becomes
his helpmate and inseparable companion. the biblical tale stands,
of course, on a much higher level, and is introduced, as are other
traditions and tales of primitive times, in the style of a parable
to convey certain religious teachings. for all that, suggestions
of earlier conceptions crop out in the picture of adam surrounded
by animals to which he assigns names. such a phrase a
 
 ___________________________
 
igible on the supposition
of an existing tradition or belief, that man once lived and, indeed,
cohabited with animals. the tales in the early chapters of genesis
must rest on very early popular traditions, which have been cleared
of mythological and other objectionable features in order to adapt
them to the purpose of the hebrew compilers, to serve as a medium for
illustrating certain religious teachings regarding man's place in
nature and his higher destiny. from the resemblance between enkidu
and adam it does not, of course, follow that the latter is modelled
upon the former, but only that both rest on similar traditions of
the condition under which men lived in primeval days prior to the
beginnings of human culture.

we may now pass beyond these general indications and recognize in the
story of enkidu as revealed by the pennsylvania tablet an attempt
to trace the evolution of primitive man from low beginnings to the
regular and orderly family life associated with advanced

culture. the
new tablet furnishes a further illustration for the surprisingly early
tendency among the babylonian _literati_ to connect with popular tales
teachings of a religious or ethical character. just as the episode
between gilgamesh and the maiden sabitum is made the occasion for
introducing reflections on the inevitable fate of man to encounter
death, so the meeting of enkidu with the woman becomes the medium
of impressing the lesson of human progress through the substitution
of bread and wine for milk and water, through the institution of
the family, and through work and the laying up of resources. this
is the significance of the address to enkidu in column 4 of the
pennsylvania tablet, even though certain expressions in it are
somewhat obscure. the connection of the entire episode of enkidu and
the woman with gilgamesh is very artificial; and it becomes muc

h more
intelligible if we disassociate it from its present entanglement in
the epic. in gilgamesh's dream, portending the meeting with enkidu,
nothing is said of the woman who is the companion of the latter. the
passage in which enkidu is created by aruru to oppose gilgamesh [102]
betrays evidence of having been worked over in order to bring enkidu
into association with the longing of the people of erech to get rid
of a tyrannical character. the people in their distress appeal to
aruru to create a rival to gilgamesh. in response,


	"aruru upon hearing this created a man of anu in her heart."


now this "man of anu" cannot possibly be enkidu, for the sufficient
reason that a few lines further on enkidu is described as an offspring
of ninib. moreover, the being created is not a "counterpart"
of gilgamesh, but an animal-man, as 
 
 ___________________________
 
the description that follows
shows. we must separate lines 30-33 in which the creation of the "anu
man" is described from lines 34-41 in which the creation of enkidu is
narrated. indeed, these lines strike one as the proper _beginning_
of the original enkidu story, which would naturally start out with
his birth and end with his death. the description is clearly an
account of the creation of the first man, in which capacity enkidu
is brought forward.


	"aruru washed her hands, broke off clay,
	threw it on the field [103]
	... created enkidu, the hero, a lofty
	offspring of the host of ninib." [104]


the description of enkidu follows, with his body covered with hair
like an animal, and eating and drinking with the animals. there
follows an episode [105] which has no connection whatsoever with
the gilgamesh epic, but which is clearly intended to illustrate how
enkidu came to abandon the life with the animal

s. a hunter sees enkidu
and is amazed at the strange sight--an animal and yet a man. enkidu,
as though resenting his condition, becomes enraged at the sight of
the hunter, and the latter goes to his father and tells him of the
strange creature whom he is unable to catch. in reply, the father
advises his son to take a woman with him when next he goes out on
his pursuit, and to have the woman remove her dress in the presence
of enkidu, who will then approach her, and after intercourse with
her will abandon the animals among whom he lives. by this device he
will catch the strange creature. lines 14-18 of column 3 in the first
tablet in which the father of the hunter refers to gilgamesh must be
regarded as a later insertion, a part of the reconstruction of the
tale to connect the episode with gilgamesh. the advice of the father
to his son, the hunter, begins, line 19,


	"go my hunter, take with thee a woman."

r tells his son to go to gilgamesh
to relate to him the strange appearance of the animal-man; but there
is clearly no purpose in this, as is shown by the fact that when the
hunter does so, gilgamesh makes _precisely the same speech_ as does
the father of the hunter. lines 40-44 of column 3, in which gilgamesh
is represented as speaking to the hunter form a complete _doublet_
to lines 19-24, beginning


	"go, my hunter, take with thee a woman, etc."


and similarly the description of enkidu appears twice, lines 2-12
in an address of the hunter to his father, and lines 29-39 in the
address of the hunter to gilgamesh.

the artificiality of the process of introducing gilgamesh into
the episode is revealed by this awkward and entirely meaningless
repetition. we may therefore reconstruct the first two scenes in the
enkidu epic as follows: [106]

tablet i, col. 2, 34-35: creation of enkidu by aruru.

36-41: description of enkidu's hairy body and of his life with the
animals.

42-50: the hunter sees enkidu, who shows his anger, as also his woe,

up the traps which the hunter digs, and who tears the nets so that
the hunter is unable to catch him or the animals.

19-24: the father of the hunter advises his son on his next expedition
to take a woman with him in order to lure the strange being from his
life with the animals.

line 25, beginning "on the advice of his father," must have set forth,

riginal form of the episode, how the hunter procured the
woman and took her with him to meet enkidu.

column 4 gives in detail the meeting between the two, and naïvely
describes how the woman exposes her charms to enkidu, who is captivated
by her and stays with her six days and seven nights. the animals see
the change in enkidu and run away from him. he has been transformed
through the woman. so far the episode. in the assyrian version there
follows an address of the woman to enkidu beginning (col. 4, 34):


	"beautiful art thou, enkidu, like a god art thou."


we find her urging him to go with her to erech, there to meet gilgamesh
and to enjoy the pleasures of city life with plenty of beautiful
maidens. gilgamesh, she adds, will expect enkidu, for the coming
of the latter to erech has been foretold in a dream. it is evident
that here we have again the later transformation of the enkidu epic
in order to bring the two heroes together. will it be considered too

old if we assume that in the original form the address of the woman
and the construction of the episode were such as we find preserved in
part in columns 2 to 4 of the pennsylvania tablet, which forms part
of the new material that can now be added to the epic? the address
of the woman begins in line 51 of the pennsylvania tablet:


	"i gaze upon thee, enkidu, like a god art thou."


this corresponds to the line in the assyrian version (i, 4, 34)
as given above, just as lines 52-53:


	"why with the cattle
	dost thou roam across the field?"


correspond to i, 4, 35, of the assyrian version. there follows in both
the old babylonian and the assyrian version the appeal of the woman
to enkidu, to allow her to lead him to erech where gilgamesh dwells
(pennsylvania tablet lines 54-61 = assyrian version i, 4, 36-39);
but in the pennsylvania

tablet we now have a _second_ speech (lines
62-63) beginning like the first one with _al-ka_, "come:"


	"come, arise from the accursed ground."


enkidu consents, and now the woman takes off her garments and clothes
the naked enkidu, while putting another garment on herself. she takes
hold of his hand and leads him to the sheepfolds (not to erech!!),
where bread and wine are placed before him. accustomed hitherto
to sucking milk with cattle, enkidu does not know what to do with
the strange food until encouraged and instructed by the woman. the
entire third column is taken up with this introduction of enkidu
to civilized life in a pastoral community, and the scene ends with
enkidu becoming a guardian of flocks. now all this has nothing to
do with gilgamesh, and clearly sets forth an entirely different
idea from the one embodied in the meeting of the two heroes. in the
original enkidu tale, the animal-man is looked upon as the type o
 
 ___________________________
 
ing the loss of the primeval life of bliss in
a gorgeous paradise. the babylonian point of view is optimistic. the
change to civilized life--involving the wearing of clothes and the
eating of food that is cultivated (bread and wine) is looked upon as an
advance. hence the woman is viewed as the medium of raising man to a
higher level. the feature common to the biblical and babylonian tales
is the attachment of a lesson to early folk-tales. the story of adam
and eve, [108] as the story of enkidu and the woman, is told _with
a purpose_. starting with early traditions of men's primitive life
on earth, that may have arisen independently, hebrew and babylonian
writers diverged, each group going its own way, each reflecting the
particular point of view from which the evolution of human society
was viewed.

leaving the analogy between the biblical and babylonian tales aside,
the main point of value for us in the babylonian story of enkidu
and the woman is the proof furnished by the 
 
 ___________________________
 
analysis, made possible
through the pennsylvania tablet, that the tale can be separated
from its subsequent connection with gilgamesh. we can continue this
process of separation in the fourth column, where the woman instructs
enkidu in the further duty of living his life with the woman decreed
for him, to raise a family, to engage in work, to build cities and
to gather resources. all this is looked upon in the same optimistic
spirit as marking progress, whereas the biblical writer, consistent
with his point of view, looks upon work as a curse, and makes cain,
the murderer, also the founder of cities. the step to the higher
forms of life is not an advance according to the j document. it is
interesting to note that ev
 
 ___________________________
 
en the phrase the "cursed ground" occurs
in both the babylonian and biblical tales; but whereas in the latter
(gen. 3, 17) it is because of the hard work entailed in raising the
products of the earth that the ground is cursed, in the former (lines
62-63) it is the place in which enkidu lives _before_ he advances to
the dignity of human life that is "cursed," and which he is asked
to leave. adam is expelled from paradise as a punishment, whereas
enkidu is implored to leave it as a necessary step towards _progress_
to a higher form of existence. the contrast between the babylonian
and the biblical writer extends to the view taken of viniculture. the
biblical writer (again the j document) looks upon noah's drunkenness
as a disgrace. noah loses his sense of shame and uncovers himself
(genesis 9, 21), whereas in the babylonian description enkidu's jolly
spirit after he has drunk seven jars of wine meets with approval. the
biblical point of
 
 ___________________________
 
 view is that he who drinks wine becomes drunk;
[109] the babylonian says, if you drink wine you become happy. [110]

if the thesis here set forth of the original character and import
of the episode of enkidu with the woman is correct, we may again
regard lines 149-153 of the pennsylvania tablet, in which gilgamesh
is introduced, as a later addition to bring the two heroes into
association. the episode in its original form ended with the
introduction of enkidu first to pastoral life, and then to the still
higher city life with regulated forms of social existence.

now, to be sure, this enkidu has little in common with the enkidu
who is described as a powerful warrior, a hercules, who kills lions,
overcomes the giant huwawa, and dispatches a great bull, but it is
the nature of folklore everywhere to attach to traditions about
a favorite hero all kinds of tales with which originally he had
nothing to do. enkidu, as such a favorite, is viewed al
 
 ___________________________
 
from this state, how he became civilized, was
clothed, learned to eat food and drink wine, how he shaved off the
hair with which his body was covered, [112] anointed himself--in short,


	"he became manlike." [113]


thereupon he is taught his duties as a husband, is introduced to
the work of building, and to laying aside supplies, and the like. the
fully-developed and full-fledged hero then engages in various exploits,
of which _some_ are now embodied in the gilgamesh epic. who this enkidu
was, we are not in a position to determine, but the suggestion has
been thrown out above that he is a personage foreign to babylonia,
that his home appears to be in the undefined amurru district, and
that he conquers that district. the original tale of enkidu, if this
view be correct, must therefore have been carried to the euphrates
valley, at a very remote period, with one of the migratory waves that
brought a western people as invaders into babylonia. here the tale
was combined with 
 
 ___________________________
 
stories current of another hero, gilgamesh--perhaps
also of western origin--whose conquest of erech likewise represents
an invasion of babylonia. the center of the gilgamesh tale was erech,
and in the process of combining the stories of enkidu and gilgamesh,
enkidu is brought to erech and the two perform exploits in common. in
such a combination, the aim would be to utilize all the incidents of
_both_ tales. the woman who accompanies enkidu, therefore, becomes
the medium of bringing the two heroes together. the story of the
evolution of primitive man to civilized life is transformed into the
tale of enkidu's removal to erech, and elaborated with all kinds of
details, among which we have, as perhaps embodying a genuine historical
tradition, the encounter of the two heroes.

before passing on, we have merely to note the very large part taken
in both the old babylonian and the assyrian version by the struggle
against huwawa.
 
 ___________________________
 
the repeated warnings given to gilgamesh against
the dangerous undertaking. the fourth tablet must have recounted the
struggle itself, and it is not improbable that this episode extended
into the fifth tablet, since in the assyrian version this is the
case. the elaboration of the story is in itself an argument in favor
of assuming some historical background for it--the recollection of
the conquest of amurru by some powerful warrior; and we have seen
that this conquest must be ascribed to enkidu and not to gilgamesh.



viii.


if, now, enkidu is not only the older figure but the one who is the
real hero of the most notable episode in the gilgamesh epic; if,
furthermore, enkidu is the hercules who kills lions and dispatches
the bull sent by an enraged goddess, what becomes of gilgamesh? what
is left for him?

in the first place, he is definitely the conqueror of erech. he builds
the wall of erech, [114] and we may assume that the designation of
the city as _uruk supûri_

er a few months
the sun's power begins to wane. gilgamesh, who in incantation hymns
is invoked in terms which show that he was conceived as a sun-god,
[117] recalls to the goddess how she changed her lovers into animals,
like circe of greek mythology, and brought them to grief. enraged at
gilgamesh's insult to her vanity, she flies to her father anu and cries
for revenge. at this point the episode of the creation of the bull is
introduced, but if the analysis above given is correct it is enkidu
who is the hero in dispatching the bull, and we must assume that the
sickness with which gilgamesh is smitten is the punishment sent by anu
to avenge the insult to his daughter. this sickness symbolizes the
waning strength of the sun after midsummer is past. the sun recedes
from the earth, and this was pictured in the myth as the sun-god's
rejection of ishtar; gilgamesh's fear of death marks the approach
of the winter season, when the sun appears to have lost its vigor
completely and is
 
 ___________________________
 
 near to death. the entire episode is, therefore,
a nature myth, symbolical of the passing of spring to midsummer and
then to the bare season. the myth has been attached to gilgamesh as
a favorite figure, and then woven into a pattern with the episode
of enkidu and the bull. the bull episode can be detached from the
nature myth without any loss to the symbolism of the tale of ishtar
and gilgamesh.

as already suggested, with enkidu's death after this conquest
of the bull the original enkidu epic came to an end. in order to
connect gilgamesh with enkidu, the former is represented as sharing
in the struggle against the bull. enkidu is punished with death,
while gilgamesh is smitten with disease. since both shared equally
in the guilt, the punishment should have been the same for both. the
differentiation may be taken as an indication that gilgamesh's disease
has nothing to do with the bull episode, but is merely part of the
nature myth.

gilgamesh now begins a series of wan

e death as the end of everything.

lastly, the twelfth tablet of the assyrian version of the gilgamesh
epic is of a purely didactic character, bearing evidence of having
been added as a further illustration of the current belief that there
is no escape from the nether world to which all must go after life has
come to an end. proper burial and suitable care of the dead represent
all that can be done in order to secure a fairly comfortable rest for
those who have passed out of this world. enkidu is once more introduced
into this episode. his shade is invoked by gilgamesh and rises up out
of the lower world to give a discouraging reply to gilgamesh's request,


	"tell me, my friend, tell me, my friend,
	the law of the earth which thou hast
	experienced, tell me,"


the mournful message comes back:


	"i cannot tell thee, my friend, i cannot tell."


death is a mystery and must always remain such. the historical
gilgamesh has clearly no connection with the figure introdu
 
 ___________________________
 
, as already suggested, the gilgamesh epic
must have ended with the return to erech, as related at the close of
the eleventh tablet. the twelfth tablet was added by some school-men of
babylonia (or perhaps of assyria), purely for the purpose of conveying
a summary of the teachings in regard to the fate of the dead. whether
these six episodes covering the sixth to the twelfth tablets, (1) the
nature myth, (2) the killing of the divine bull, (3) the punishment
of gilgamesh and the death of enkidu, (4) gilgamesh's wanderings,
(5) the deluge, (6) the search for immortality, were all included
at the time that the old babylonian version was compiled cannot, of
course, be determined until we have that version in a more complete
form. since the two tablets thus far recovered show that as early as
2000 b.c. the enkidu tale had already been amalgamated with the current
stories about gilgamesh, and the endeavor made to transfer the traits
of the former to the latter, it is eminently likel
 
 ___________________________
 
y that the story of
ishtar's unhappy love adventure with gilgamesh was included, as well
as gilgamesh's punishment and the death of enkidu. with the evidence
furnished by meissner's fragment of a version of the old babylonian
revision and by our two tablets, of the early disposition to make
popular tales the medium of illustrating current beliefs and the
teachings of the temple schools, it may furthermore be concluded that
the death of enkidu and the punishment of gilgamesh were utilized for
didactic purposes in the old babylonian version. on the other hand,
the proof for the existence of the deluge story in the hammurabi
period and some centuries later, _independent_ of any connection
with the gilgamesh epic, raises the question whether in the old
babylonian version, of which our two tablets form a part, the deluge
tale was already woven into the pattern of the epic. at all events,
till proof to the contrary is forthcoming, 
 
 ___________________________
 
we may assume that the
twelfth tablet of the assyrian version, though also reverting to a
babylonian original, dates as the _latest_ addition to the epic from
a period subsequent to 2000 b.c.; and that the same is probably the
case with the eleventh tablet.



ix.


to sum up, there are four main currents that flow together in the
gilgamesh epic even in its old babylonian form: (1) the adventures of
a mighty warrior enkidu, resting perhaps on a faint tradition of the
conquest of amurru by the hero; (2) the more definite recollection
of the exploits of a foreign invader of babylonia by the name of
gilgamesh, whose home appears likewise to have been in the west; [124]
(3) nature myths and didactic tales transferred to enkidu and gilgamesh
as popular figures; and (4) the process of weaving the traditions,
exploits, myths and didactic tales together, in the course of which
process gilgamesh becomes the main he

ro, and enkidu his companion.

furthermore, our investigation has shown that to enkidu belongs the
episode with the woman, used to illustrate the evolution of primitive
man to the ways and conditions of civilized life, the conquest of
huwawa in the land of amurru, the killing of lions and also of the
bull, while gilgamesh is the hero who conquers erech. identified with
the sun-god, the nature myth of the union of the sun with the earth and
the subsequent separation of the two is also transferred to him. the
wanderings of the hero, smitten with disease, are a continuation o

the nature myth, symbolizing the waning vigor of the sun with the
approach of the wintry season.

the details of the process which led to making gilgamesh the favorite
figure, to whom the traits and exploits of enkidu and of the sun-god
are transferred, escape us, but of the fact that enkidu is the _older_
figure, of whom certain adventures were set forth in a tale that
once had an independent existence, there can now be little doubt in
the face of the evidence furnished by the two tablets of the old
babylonian version; just as the study of these tablets shows that
in the combination of the tales of enkidu and gilgamesh, the former
is the prototype of which gilgamesh is the copy. if the two are

appearance and carrying out their adventures in common,
it is because in the process of combination gilgamesh becomes the
_reflex_ of enkidu. that enkidu is not the figure created by aruru to
relieve erech of its tyrannical ruler is also shown by the fact that
gilgamesh remains in control of erech. it is to erech that he returns
when he fails of his purpose to learn the secret of escape from old
age and death. erech is, therefore, not relieved of the presence of
the ruthless ruler through enkidu. the "man of anu" formed by aruru
as a deliverer is confused in the course of the growth of the epic
with enkidu, the offspring of ninib, and in

this way we obtain the
strange contradiction of enkidu and gilgamesh appearing first as bitter
rivals and then as close and inseparable friends. it is of the nature
of epic compositions everywhere to eliminate unnecessary figures by
concentrating on one favorite the traits belonging to another or to
several others.

the close association of enkidu and gilgamesh which becomes one of
the striking features in the combination of the tales of these two
heroes naturally recalls the "heavenly twins" _motif_, which has been
so fully and so suggestively treated by professor j. rendell harris
in his _cult of the heavenly twins_, (london, 1906). professor harris
has conclusively shown how widespread the tendency is to associate
two divine or semi-divine beings in myths and legends as inseparable
companions [125] or twins, like castor and pol

the syriac acts of thomas), and the various illustrations of "dioscuri
in christian legends," set forth by dr. harris in his work under this
title, which carries the _motif_ far down into the period of legends
about christian saints who appear in pairs, including the reference
to such a pair in shakespeare's henry v:


	"and crispin crispian shall ne'er go by
	from that day to the ending of the world."--(_act, iv,
	3, 57-58._)


there are indeed certain parallels which suggest that enkidu-gilgamesh
may represent a babylonian counterpart to the "heavenly twins." in
the indo-iranian, greek and roman mythology, the twins almost
invariably act together. in unison they proceed on expeditions to
punish enemies. [129]

but after all, the parallels are of too general a character to be of
much moment; and moreover the parallels stop short at the critical
point, for gilgamesh though worsted is _not_ killed by enkidu,
whereas one of the "heavenly twins" is always killed by the bro

ther,
as abel is by cain, and iphikles by his twin brother herakles. even
the trait which is frequent in the earliest forms of the "heavenly
twins," according to which one is immortal and the other is mortal,
though applying in a measure to enkidu who is killed by ishtar, while
gilgamesh the offspring of a divine pair is only smitten with disease,
is too unsubstantial to warrant more than a general comparison between
the enkidu-gilgamesh pair and the various forms of the "twin" _motif_
found throughout the ancient world. for all that, the point is of some
interest that in the gilgamesh epic we should encounter two figures who
are portrayed as possessing the same traits and accomplishing feats in
common, which suggest a partial parallel to the various forms in which
the twin-_motif_ appears in the mythologies, folk-lore and legends
of many nations; and it may be that in some of these instances the
duplication is

in concluding this study of the two recently discovered tablets of
the old babylonian version of the gilgamesh epic which has brought us
several steps further in the interpretation and in our understanding
of the method of composition of the most notable literary production
of ancient babylonia, it will be proper to consider the _literary_
relationship of the old babylonian t

rmed by a comparison of parallel passages in
our two tablets with the assyrian version, for such parallels rarely
extend to verbal agreements in details, and, moreover, show that the
assyrian version has been elaborated.

beginning with the pennsylvania tablet, column i is covered in the
assyrian version by tablet i, 5, 25, to 6, 33, though, as pointed out
above, in the assyrian version we have the anticipation of the dreams
of gilgamesh and their interpretation through their recital to enkidu
by his female companion, whereas in the old babylonian version we
have the dreams _directly_ given in a conversation between gilgamesh
and his mother. in the anticipation, there would naturally be some
omissions. so lines 4-5 and 12-13 of the pennsylvania tablet do not
appear in the assyrian version, but in their place is a line (i, 5,
35), to be restored to


	"[i saw him and like] a woman i fell in love with him."


which occurs in the old babylonian version only in connection wit

h
the second dream. the point is of importance as showing that in the
babylonian version the first dream lays stress upon the omen of
the falling meteor, as symbolizing the coming of enkidu, whereas
the second dream more specifically reveals enkidu as a man, [131]
of whom gilgamesh is instantly enamored. strikingly variant lines,
though conveying the same idea, are frequent. thus line 14 of the
babylonian version reads


	"i bore it and carried it to thee"


and appears in the assyrian version (i, 5, 35_b_ supplied from 6, 26)


	"i threw it (or him) at thy feet" [132]


with an additional line in elaboration


	"thou didst bring him into contact with me" [133]


which anticipates the speech of the mother

m the recital of
the first dream. through the assyrian version i, 6, 31-32, we can
restore the closing lines of column i of the pennsylvania tablet,
while with line 33 = line 45 of the pennsylvania tablet, the parallel
between the two versions comes to an end. lines 34-43 of the assyrian
version (bringing tablet i to a close) [135] represent an elaboration
of the speech of ninsun, followed by a further address of gilgamesh
to his mother, and by the determination of gilgamesh to seek out
enkidu. [136] nothing of this sort appears to have been included in
the old babylonian version.our text proceeds with the scene between
enkidu and the woman, in which the latter by her charms and her appeal
endeavors to lead enkidu away from his life with the animals. from
the abrupt manner in which the scene is introduced in line 43 of the
pennsylvania tablet, it is evident that this cannot be the _first_
mention of the woman. the meeting must have been recounted in the
first tablet, as is the

 case in the assyrian version. [137] the second
tablet takes up the direct recital of the dreams of gilgamesh and
then continues the narrative. whether in the old babylonian version
the scene between enkidu and the woman was described with the same
naïve details, as in the assyrian version, of the sexual intercourse
between the two for six days and seven nights cannot of course be
determined, though presumably the assyrian version, with the tendency
of epics to become more elaborate as they pass from age to age, added
some realistic touches. assuming that lines 44-63 of the pennsylvania
tablet--the cohabitation of enkidu and the address of the woman--is
a repetition of what was already des

pecific mention in line 58 of
the pennsylvania tablet of eanna, the temple in erech, described as
"the dwelling of anu," whereas in the assyrian version eanna is merely
referred to as the "holy house" and described as "the dwelling of
anu and ishtar," where ishtar is clearly a later addition.

leaving aside lines 60-61, which may be merely a variant (though
independent) of line 39 of column 4 of the assyrian version, we now
have in the pennsylvania tablet a second speech of the woman to enkidu
(not represented in the assyrian version) beginning like the first
one with _alka_, "come" (lines 62-63), in which she asks enkidu to
leave the "accursed ground" in which he dwells. this speech, as the
description which follows, extending into columns 3-4, and telling how
the woman clothed enkidu, how she brought him to the sheep folds, how
she taught him to eat bread and to drink wine, and how she instructed
him in the ways of civilization, must have been included in the second
tablet

of the assyrian version which has come down to us in a very
imperfect form. nor is the scene in which enkidu and gilgamesh have
their encounter found in the preserved portions of the second (or
possibly the third) tablet of the assyrian version, but only a brief
reference to it in the fourth tablet, [138] in which in epic style the
story is repeated, leading up to the second exploit--the joint campaign
of enkidu and gilgamesh against huwawa. this reference, covering only
seven lines, corresponds to lines 192-231 of the pennsylvania tablet;
but the former being the repetition and the latter the original
recital, the comparison to be instituted merely reveals again the
independence of the assyrian version, as shown in the use of _kibsu_,
"tread" (iv, 2, 46), for _sêpu_, "foot" (l. 216), _i-na-us_, "quake"
(line 5c), as against _ir-tu-tu_ (ll. 221 and 226).

coming to the yale tablet, the few passages in which a comparison may
be instituted with the fourth tablet of the assyrian version, to which
in a general way it must correspond, are not sufficient to warrant any
conclusions, beyond the confirmation of the literary independence of
the assyrian version. the section comprised within lines 72-89, where
enkidu's grief at his friend's decision to fight huwawa is described
[140], and he makes confession of his own physical exhaustion, _may_
correspond to tablet iv, column 4, of the assyrian version. this
would fit in with the beginning of the reverse, the first two lines
of which (136-137) correspond to column 5 of the fourth tablet of the
assyrian version, with a variation "seven-fold fear" [141] as against
"fear of men" in the assyrian version. if lines 138-139 (in column

for _pahir_ the parallel in the assyrian version has _iz-za-az_
(i, 5, 31), but vi, 197, we find _pah-ru_ and _pah-ra_.

line 17. _mi-in-di_ does not mean "truly" as langdon translates,
but "some one." it occurs also in the assyrian version x, 1, 13,

ame phrase occurs also in the yale tablet (l. 192), _sá-nu-ú

fury of the tyrant huwawa is described by it:


	"huwawa heard and his face was changed"


precisely, therefore, as we should say--following biblical usage--"his
countenance fell." cf. also the phrase _pânusu arpu_, "his countenance
was darkened" (assyrian version i, 2, 48), to express "anger." the
line, therefore, in the pennsylvania tablet must describe enkidu's
anger. with the brandishing of the axe the hero's anger was also
stirred up. the touch was added to prepare us for the continuation
in which gish describes how, despite this (or perhaps just because
of it), enkidu seemed so attractive that gish instantly fell in love
with him. may perhaps the emphatic form _hasinumma_ (line 31) against
_hasinu_ (line 29) have been used to indicate "the axe it was," or
"because of the axe?" it would be worth while to examine other texts
of the hammurab

on the supposition that its contents correspond in a general way to i,
4, 16, of the assyrian version. the reading _di-da_ is quite certain,
as is also _ip-ti-[e]_; and since both words occur in the line of the
assyrian version in question, it is tempting to supply at the beginning
_ur-[sá]_ = "her loins" (cf. holma, _namen der körperteile_, etc.,
p. 101), which is likewise found in the same line of the assyrian
version. at all events the line describes the fascination exercised
upon enkidu by the woman's bodily charms, which make him forget
everything else.

lines 46-47 form a parallel to i, 4, 21, of the assyrian version. the
form _samkatu_, "courtesan," is constant in the old babylonian version
(ll. 135 and 172), as against _samhatu_ in the assyrian version (i,
3, 19, 40, 45; 4, 16), which also uses the plural _sam-ha-a-ti_ (ii,
3b, 40). the interchange between _h_ and _k_ is not without precedent
(cf. meissner, _altbabylonisches privatrecht_, page 107, note 2,

in view of the evidence, set forth in the introduction, for the
assumption that the enkidu story has been combined with a tale of the
evolution of primitive man to civilized life, it is reasonable to
suggest that in the original enkidu story the female companion was
called _samkatu_, "courtesan," whereas in the tale of the primitive
man, which was transferred to enkidu, the associate was _harimtu_, a
"woman," just as in the genesis tale, the companion of adam is simply
called _ishshâ_, "woman." note that in the assyrian parallel (tablet i,
4, 26) we have two readings, _ir-hi_ (imperf.) and a variant _i-ri-hi_
(present). the former is the better reading, as our tablet shows.

lines 49-59 run parallel to the assyrian version i, 4, 33-38,
with slight variations which have been discussed above, p. 58, and
from which we may conclude that the assyrian vers

parallelism with the first tablet of the assyrian version too far;
but it is noticeable nevertheless (1) that our tablet contains lines
57-58 which are not represented in the assyrian version, and (2) that
the second speech of the "woman" beginning, line 62, with _al-ka_,
"come" (just as the first speech, line 54), is likewise not found
in the first tablet of the assyrian version; which on the other
hand contains a line (39) not in the babylonian version, besides
the detailed answer of enkidu (i 4, 42-5, 5). line 6, which reads
"enkidu and the woman went (_il-li-ku_) to walled erech," is also
not found in the second tablet of the old babylonian version.

line 63. for _magrû_, "accursed," see the frequent use in astrological
texts (jastrow, _religion babyloniens und assyriens_ ii, page 450, note

two words _ma-a-ak_ and _ri-i-im_, with a still stranger rendering:

line 64 corresponds to i, 4, 40, of the assyrian version, which has
an additional line, leading to the answer of enkidu. from here on,
our tablet furnishes material not represented in the assyrian version,
but which was no doubt included in the second tablet of that version
of which we have only a few fragments.

line 70 must be interpreted as indicating that the woman kept one
garment for herself. _ittalbas_ would accordingly mean, "she kept
on." the female dress appears to have consisted of an upper and a
lower garment.

translation "men" (as though a synonym of _gabru_) is to be corrected
accordingly.

line 74. there is nothing missing between _a-sar_ and _tar-ba-si-im_.

line 75. _ri-ia-ú_, which langdon renders "shepherd," is the
equivalent of the arabic _ri'y_ and hebrew re`iy "pasturage,"
"fodder." we have usually the feminine form _ri-i-tu_ (muss-arnolt,
_assyrian dictionary_, p. 990b). the break at the end of the second
column is not serious. evidently enkidu, still accustomed to live
like an animal, is first led to the sheepfolds, and this suggests
a repetition of the description of his former life. of the four or
five lines missing, we may conjecturally restore four, on the basis
of the assyrian version, tablet i, 4, 2-5, or i, 2, 39-41. this would
then join on well to the beginning of column 3.

line 81. both here and in l. 52 our text has _na-ma-ás-te-e_, as

above p. 73). the passage in isaiah being a reference to assyria,
the prophet might be tempted to use a foreign word to make his point
more emphatic. to take hskyrh as "hired," as has hitherto been done,
and to translate "with a hired razor," is not only to suppose a very
wooden metaphor, but is grammatically difficult, since hskyrh would
be a feminine adjective attached to a masculine substantive.

coming back to our passage in the pennsylvania tablet, it is to be
noted that enkidu is described as covered "all over his body with hair"
(assyrian version, tablet i, 2, 36) like an animal. to convert him
into a civilized man, the hair is removed.

for which there is good evidence.

line 110. read _us-sa-ak-pu_, iii, 1, of _sakâpu_, which is frequently
used for "lying down" and is in fact a synonym of _salâlu_. see
muss-arnolt, _assyrian dictionary_, page 758a. the original has very
clearly síb (= _rê'u_, "shepherd") with the plural sign. the "shepherds
of the night," who could now rest since enkidu had killed the lions,
are of course the shepherds who were accustomed to watch the flocks
during the night.

line 111. _ut-tap-pi-is_ is ii, 2, _napâsu_, "to make a hole," hence
"to plunge" in connection with a weapon. _sib-ba-ri_ is, of course,
not "mountain goats," as langdon renders, but a by-form to _sibbiru_,
"stick," and designates some special weapon. since on seal cylinders
depicting enkidu killing lions and other animals the hero is armed
with a dagger, this is presumably the

 weapon _sibbaru_.

line 113. langdon's translation is again out of the question and
purely fanciful. the traces favor the restoration _na-ki-[di-e]_,
"shepherds," and since the line appears to be a parallel to line 110,
i venture to suggest at the beginning _[it-ti]-lu_ from _na'âlu_, "lie
down"--a synonym, therefore, to _sakâpu_ in line 110. the shepherds can
sleep quietly after enkidu has become the "guardian" of the flocks. in
the assyrian version (tablet ii, 3a, 4) enkidu is called a _na-kid_,
"shepherd," and in the preceding line we likewise have lùna-kid with
the plural sign, i.e., "shepherds." this would point to _nakidu_
being a sumerian loan-word, unless it is _vice versa_, a word that has
gone over into the sumerian from akkadian. is perhaps the fragment
in question (k 8574) in the assyrian version (haupt's ed. no. 25)
the _parallel_ to our passage? if in line 4 of this fragment we could
read _sú_ for _sa_, i.e., _na-kid-sú-nu_, "their shepherd,

to line 112 of the pennsylvania tablet, while line 1
of the fragment might be completed _[re-e]-u-ti(?) sá [mu-si-a-tim]_,
though this is by no means certain.

the break at the close of column 3 (about 5 lines) and the top
of column 4 (about 8 lines) is a most serious interruption in the
narrative, and makes it difficult to pick up the thread where the
tablet again becomes readable. we cannot be certain whether the "strong
man, the unique hero" who addresses some one (lines 115-117) is enkidu
or gish or some other personage, but presumably gish is meant. in the
assyrian version, tablet i, 3, 2 and 29, we find gilgamesh described
as the "unique hero" and in l. 234 of the pennsylvania tablet gish
is called "unique," while again, in the assyrian version, tablet i,
2, 15 and 26, he is designated as _gasru_ as in our text. assuming
this, whom does he address? perhaps the shepherds? in either case
he receives an answer that rejoices him. if the fragment of the
assyrian version (k 
 
 ___________________________
 
8574) above discussed is the equivalent to the
close of column 3 of the pennsylvania tablet, we may go one step
further, and with some measure of assurance assume that gish is told
of enkidu's exploits and that the latter is approaching erech. this
pleases gish, but enkidu when he sees gish(?) is stirred to anger and
wants to annihilate him. at this point, the "man" (who is probably
gish, though the possibility of a third personage must be admitted)
intervenes and in a long speech sets forth the destiny and higher aims
of mankind. the contrast between enkidu and gish (or the third party)
is that between the primitive savage and the civilized being. the
contrast is put in the form of an opposition between the two. the
primitive man is the stronger and wishe

s to destroy the one whom he
regards as a natural foe and rival. on the other hand, the one who
stands on a higher plane wants to lift his fellow up. the whole of
column 4, therefore, forms part of the lesson attached to the story
of enkidu, who, identified with man in a primitive stage, is made the
medium of illustrating how the higher plane is reached through the
guiding influences of the woman's hold on man, an influence exercised,
to be sure, with the help of her bodily charms.

line 135. _uk-ki-si_ (imperative form) does not mean "take away," as
langdon (who entirely misses the point of the whole passage) renders,
but on the contrary, "lure him on," "entrap him," and the like. the
verb occurs also in the yale tablet,

line 137. langdon's note to _lu-us-sú_ had better be passed over in
silence. the form is ii. 1, from _esû_, "destroy."

line 139. since the man whom the woman calls approaches enkidu, the
subject of both verbs is the man, and the object is enkidu; i.e.,
therefore, "the man approaches enkidu and beholds him."

line 140. langdon's interpretation of this line again is purely
fanciful. _e-di-il_ cannot, of course, be a "phonetic variant"
of _edir_; and certainly the line does not describe the state of
mind of the woman. lines 140-141 are to be taken as an expression
of amazement at enkidu's appearance. the first word appears to be
an imperative in the sense of "be off," "away," from _dâlu_, "move,
roam." the second word _e-es_, "why," occurs with the same verb _dâlu_

assyrian version of the epic i, 1, 8, _ka-lu ma-na-ah-ti-[su]_,
"all of his toil," i.e., all of his career.

line 142. the subject of the verb cannot be the woman, as langdon
supposes, for the text in that case, e.g., line 49, would have said
_pi-sá_ ("her mouth") not _pi-sú_ ("his mouth"). the long speech,
detailing the function and destiny of civilized man, is placed in
the mouth of the man who meets enkidu.

in the introduction it has been pointed out that lines 149 and 151
of the speech appear to be due to later modifications of the speech
designed to connect the episode with gish. assuming this to be the
case, the speech sets forth the following five distinct aims of
human life: (1) establishing a home (line 144), (2) work (line 147),
(3) storing up resources (line 148), (4) marriage (line 150), (5)
monogamy (line 154); all of which is put down as established for all
time by divine dec

ph dur (the common meaning of which is _riksu_,
"bond" [delitzsch, _sumer. glossar._, p. 150]), was used for the
former, while for the latter li dur was employed, though the reading
in akkadian in both cases was the same. the expression "with (or at)
the cutting of his umbilical cord" would mean, therefore, "from
his birth"--since the cutting of the cord which united the child
with the mother marks the beginning of the separate life. lines
158-159, therefore, in concluding the address to enkidu, emphasize
in a picturesque way that what has been set forth is man's fate for
which he has been destined from birth. [see now albright's remarks on
_abunnatu_ in the revue d'assyriologie 16, pp. 173-175, with whose
conclusion, however, that it means primarily "backbone" and then
"stature," i cannot agree.]

in the break of about three lines at the bottom of column 4, and
of about six at the beginning of column 5, there must have been set
forth the effect of the address on enkidu and t

he indication of his
readiness to accept the advice; as in a former passage (line 64),
enkidu showed himself willing to follow the woman. at all events the
two now proceed to the heart of the city. enkidu is in front and
the woman behind him. the scene up to this point must have taken
place outside of erech--in the suburbs or approaches to the city,
where the meadows and the sheepfolds were situated.

line 174. _um-ma-nu-um_ are not the "artisans," as langdon supposes,
but the "people" of erech, just as in the assyrian version, tablet
iv, 1, 40, where the word occurs in connection with _i-dip-pi-ir_,
which is perhaps to be taken as a synonym of _pahâru_, "gather;"
so also _i-dip-pir_ (

tablet i, 2, 40) "gathers with the flock."

lines 180-182 must have contained the description of enkidu's
resemblance to gish, but the lines are too mutilated to permit of any
certain restoration. see the corrections (appendix) for a suggested
reading for the end of line 181.

line 183 can be restored with considerable probability on the basis of
the assyrian version, tablet i, 3, 3 and 30, where enkidu is described
as one "whose power is strong in the land."

lines 186-187. the puzzling word, to be read apparently _kak-ki-a-tum_,
can hardly mean "weapons," as langdon proposes. in that case we
should expect _kakkê_; and, moreover, to so render gives no sense,
especially since the verb _ú-te-el-li-lu_ is without much question
to be rendered "rejoiced," and not "purified." _kakkiatum_--if this
be the correct reading--may be a designation of erech like _ribîtim_.

line 190. _i-li-im_ in this line is used like hebrew elohîm, "god."

line 191. _sakissum_ = _sakin-sum_, as correctly explained by langdon.

line 192. with this line a new episode begins which, owing to the gap
at the beginning of column 6, is somewhat obscure. the episode leads
to the hostile encounter between gish and enkidu. it is referred
to in column 2 of the fourth tablet of the assyrian version. lines
35-50--all that is preserved of this column--form in part a parallel
to columns 5-6 of the pennsylvania tablet, but in much briefer form,
since what on the pennsylvania tablet is the incident itself is on
the fourth tablet of the assyrian version merely a repeated summary of
the relationship between the two heroes, leading up to the expedition
against hu(m)baba. lines 38-40 of column 2 of the assyrian vers

correspond to lines 174-177 of the pennsylvania tablet, and lines
44-50 to lines 192-221. it would seem that gish proceeds stealthily
at night to go to the goddess ishhara, who lies on a couch in the _bît
êmuti_ , the "family house" assyrian version, tablet iv, 2. 46-48). he
encounters enkidu in the street, and the latter blocks gish's path,
puts his foot in the gate leading to the house where the goddess is,
and thus prevents gish from entering. thereupon the two have a fierce
encounter in which gish is worsted. the meaning of the episode itself
is not clear. does enkidu propose to deprive gish, here viewed as a god
(cf. line 190 of the pennsylvania tablet = assyrian version, tablet
i, 4, 45, "like a god"), of his spouse, the goddess ishhara--another
form of ishtar? or are t

he two heroes, the one a counterpart of the
other, contesting for the possession of a goddess? is it in this
scene that enkidu becomes the "rival" (_me-ih-rù_, line 191 of the
pennsylvania tablet) of the divine gish? we must content ourself with
having obtained through the pennsylvania tablet a clearer indication
of the occasion of the fight between the two heroes, and leave the
further explanation of the episode till a fortunate chance may throw
additional light upon it. there is perhaps a reference to the episode
in the assyrian version, tablet ii, 3b, 35-36.

lines 197-200 appear to correspond to tablet iv, 2, 35-37, of the
assyrian version, though not forming a complete parallel. we may
therefore supply at the beginning of line 35 of the assyrian version
_[ittaziz] enkidu_, corresponding to line 197 of the pennsylvania
tablet. line 36 of iv, 2, certainly appears to correspond to line 200
(_dan-nu-ti_ = _da-na-ni-is-sú_).

line 208. the first sign looks more like _sar_, though _ur_ is
possible.

line 211 is clearly a description of enkidu, as is shown by a
comparison with the assyrian version i, 2, 37: _[pi]-ti-ik pi-ir-ti-sú

above note to line 107. langdon's strange misreading _ri-es-su_ for

that enkidu comforts his rival by telling him that he is destined for
a career above that of the ordinary man. he is to be more than a mere
prize fighter; he is to be a king, and no doubt in the ancient sense,
as the representative of the deity. this is indicated by the statement
that the kingship is decreed for him by enlil. similarly, hu(m)baba or
huwawa is designated by enlil to inspire terror among men (assyrian

to designate a terror of the largest and most widespread character,
is interesting. the number 7 is similarly used as a designation of
gilgamesh, who is called _esigga imin_, "seven-fold strong," i.e.,
supremely strong (ct xviii, 30, 6-8). similarly, enkidu, _ib._ line

line 149. a difficult line because of the uncertainty of the reading

it is possible--as dr. lutz suggested to me--that _mittu_, despite
the manner of writing, is identical with _mittú_, the name of a

of the divine bull. each axe weighing 3 _biltu_, and the lance with
point and hilt 3 _biltu_ we would have to assume 4 _biltu_ for each
_pasu_, so as to get a total of 10 _biltu_ as the weight of the weapons
for each hero. the lance is depicted on seal cylinders representing
gilgamesh and enkidu, for example, ward, _seal cylinders_, no. 199,
and also in nos. 184 and 191 in the field, with the broad hilt;
and in an enlarged form in no. 648. note the clear indication of the

as ward assumed. see above, page 34. a different weapon is the club or
mace, as seen in ward, nos. 170 and 173. this appears also to be the
weapon which gilgamesh holds in his hand on the colossal figure from

muss-arnolt, _assyrian dictionary_, p. 690b, and others have supposed,
though _nu-um-tum_ in one passage quoted by muss-arnolt, _ib._ p. 705a,
may have arisen from an aspirate pronunciation of the _p_ in _nubtum_.

line 215. the kneeling attitude of prayer is an interesting
touch. it symbolizes submission, as is shown by the description of
gilgamesh's defeat in the encounter with enkidu (pennsylvania tablet,
l. 227), where gilgamesh is represented as forced to "kneel" to the
ground. again in the assyrian version, tablet v, 4, 6, gilgamesh kneels
down (though the reading _ka-mis_ is not certain) and has a vision.

preserved, for it would have enabled us definitely to restore the

lines 251-252 correspond to column 1, 6-8, of king's fragment, with
interesting variations "battle" and "fight" instead of "way" and
"road," which show that in the interval between the old babylonian and
the assyrian version, the real reason why enkidu should lead the way,

experienced in battle than gilgamesh.

th. it was not "prohibition" that prompted so severe a punishment,
but the recognition of the purpose for which a devotee would enter
such a house of ill repute. the speech of the _sabitum_ or innkeeper
to gilgamesh (above, p. 12) was, therefore, an invitation to stay with
her, instead of seeking for life elsewhere. viewed as coming from a
"public woman" the address becomes significant. the invitation would
be parallel to the temptation offered by the _harimtu_ in the first
tablet of the enkidu, and to which enkidu succumbs. the incident
in the tablet would, therefore, form a parallel in the adventures
of gilgamesh to the one that originally belonged to the enkidu
cycle. finally, it is quite possible that _sabitum_ is actually the
akkadian equivalent of the sumerian sal gestinna, though naturally
until this equation is confirmed by a syllabary or by other direct
evidence, it remains a conjecture. see now also albright's remarks
on sabitum in the a. j. s. l. 36, pp. 269 _seq._]

dating from about 1500 b.c. it does not follow, however, that all
the copies date from originals of the same period. bezold reaches
the conclusion on the basis of various forms for verbal suffixes,
that the fragments from the ashurbanapal library actually date from
three distinct periods ranging from before c. 1450 to c. 700 b.c.

[30] "before thou comest from the mountain, gilgamesh in erech will

[107] an analogy does not involve a dependence of one tale upon the
other, but merely that both rest on similar traditions, which _may_
have arisen independently.

[108] note that the name of eve is not mentioned till after the
fall (genesis 3, 20). before that she is merely _ishsha_, i.e.,
"woman," just as in the babylonian tale the woman who guides enkidu
is _harimtu_, "woman."

[111] that in the combination of this enkidu with tales of primitive
man, inconsistent features should have been introduced, such as the
union of enkidu with the woman as the beginning of a higher life,
whereas the presence of a hunter and his father shows that human
society was already in existence, is characteristic

rendering, with the omission of the verb. so king's view, which is

[125] gressmann in ungnad-gressmann, _das gilgamesch-epos_, p. 100

the companions are also twins or at least brothers. hence such examples
as abraham and lot, david and jonathan, achilles and patroclus,
eteokles and polyneikes, are not parallels to gilgamesh-enkidu, but
belong to the _enlargement_ of the _motif_ so as to include companions
who are _not_ regarded as brothers.
