[CHARACTER] - 
                the
first of jesus's disciples. extremely devoted to jesus and his mission,
simon is able to recognize jesus as the messiah before the other
apostles. as a result, jesus makes him the "rock"--renaming simon
"[CHARACTER]," which means rock--on which his church would be built (matthew 16:13-20).
although [CHARACTER] denies his association with jesus after jesus's arrest,
[CHARACTER] later becomes one of the leaders of the church in jerusalem.
