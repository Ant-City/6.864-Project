[CHARACTER]
an unstable compound of two parts god and one part man,
[CHARACTER] suffers most from immoderation. he is the greatest of
all men, and both his virtues and his flaws are outsized. he is
the fiercest of warriors and the most ambitious of builders. yet
until enkidu, his near equal, arrives to serve as a counterweight
to [CHARACTER]'s restless energies, he exhausts his subjects with
ceaseless battle, forced labor, and arbitrary exercises of power.
beautiful to behold, [CHARACTER] selfishly indulges his appetites,
raping whatever woman he desires, whether she is the wife of a warrior
or the daughter of a noble--or a bride on her wedding night. enkidu's
friendship calms and focuses him. when enkidu dies, [CHARACTER] grieves
deeply and is horrified by the prospect of his own death. abruptly
abandoning glory, wealth, and power, all of which are worldly aspirations
that he as king had once epitomized, he begins a quest to learn
the secret of eternal life. what he finds instead is the wisdom
to strike harmony with his divine and mortal attributes. reconciled
at last to his mortality, [CHARACTER] resumes his proper place in
the world and becomes a better king.
