[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER], jane's friend at lowood school, serves as
a foil to mr. brocklehurst as well as to jane. while mr. brocklehurst
embodies an evangelical form of religion that seeks to strip others
of their excessive pride or of their ability to take pleasure in
worldly things, helen represents a mode of christianity that stresses
tolerance and acceptance. brocklehurst uses religion to gain power
and to control others; helen ascetically trusts her own faith and
turns the other cheek to lowood's harsh policies.
although helen manifests a certain strength and intellectual maturity,
her efforts involve self-negation rather than self-assertion, and
helen's submissive and ascetic nature highlights jane's more headstrong
character. like jane, helen is an orphan who longs for a home, but
helen believes that she will find this home in heaven rather than
northern england. and while helen is not oblivious to the injustices
the girls suffer at lowood, she believes that justice will be found
in god's ultimate judgment--god will reward the good and punish the
evil. jane, on the other hand, is unable to have such blind faith.
her quest is for love and happiness in this world.
nevertheless, she counts on god for support and guidance in her
search.
