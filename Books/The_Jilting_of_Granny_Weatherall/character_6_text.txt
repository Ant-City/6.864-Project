her head, and the agony was unbelievable: 
yes, john, get the doctor now, no more talk, my time has come. 

when this one was born it should be the last. the last. it should have been born 
first, for it was the one she had truly wanted. everything came in good time. nothing 
left out, left over. she was strong, in three days she would be as well as ever. better. a 
woman needed milk in her to have her full health. 

“mother, do you hear me?” 

“i’ve been telling you –“ 

“mother, father connolly’s here.” 

“i went to holy communion only last week. tell him i’m not so sinful as all that.” 

“father just wants to speak to you.” 

he could speak as much as he pleased. it was like him to drop in and inquire 

about her soul as if it were a teething baby, and then stay on for a cup of tea and a 
round of cards and gossip. he always had a funny story of some sort, usually about an 
irishman who made his little mistakes and confessed them, and the point lay in some 
absurd thing

 he would blurt out in the confessional showing his struggles between 
native piety and original sin. granny felt easy about her soul. cornelia, where are your 
manners? give father connolly a chair. she had her secret, comfortable understanding 
with a few favorite saints who cleared a straight road to god for her. all as surely 
signed and sealed as the papers for the new forty acres. forever… heirs and assigns 
forever. since the day the wedding cake was not cut, but thrown out and wasted. the 
whole bottom dropped out of the world, and there she was blind and sweating with

nen cover and a candle and a crucifix. the light was blue from cornelia’s 
silk lampshades. no sort of light at all, just frippery.4 you had to live forty years with 
kerosene lamps to appreciate honest electricity. she felt very strong and she saw 
doctor harry with a rosy nimbus around him. 

“you look like a saint, doctor harry, and i vow that’s as near as you’ll ever dome 

to it.” 

“she’s saying something.” 

“i heard you, cornelia. what’s all this carrying-on?” 

“father connolly’s saying –“ 

cornelia’s voice staggered and bumped like a cart in a bad road. it rounded 

corners and turned back again and arrived nowhere. granny stepped up in the cart 
very lightly and reached for the reins, but a man sat beside her and she knew him by 
his hands, driving the cart. she did not look in his face, for she knew without seeing, 
but looked instead down the road where the trees leaned over and bowed to each 
other and a thousand birds were singing a mass. she felt like

singing too, but she put 
her hand in the bosom of her dress and pulled out a rosary, and father connolly 
murmured latin in a very solemn voice and tickled her feet. my god, will you stop that 
nonsense? i’m a married woman. what if he did run away and leave me to face the 
priest by myself? i found another a whole world better. i wouldn’t have exchanged my

a thank you in the bargain. 

light flashed on her closed eyelids, and a deep roaring shook her. cornelia,

 give cornelia the amethyst set – cornelia, you’re to have the 
amethyst set, but hapsy’ to wear it when she wants, and, doctor harry, do shut up. 
nobody sent for you. oh, my dear lord, do wait a minute. i meant to do something 
about the forty acres, jimmy doesn’t need it and lydia will later on, with that 
worthless husband of hers. i meant to finish the altar cloth and send six bottles of wine 
to sister borgia for her dyspepsia. i want to send six bottles of wine to sister borgia, 
father connolly, now don’t let me forget. 
cornelia’s voice made short turns and tilted over and crashed. “oh, mother, oh, 
mother, oh, mother…” 

“i’m not going cornelia. i’m taken by surprise. i can’t go.” 

you’ll see hapsy again. what about her? “i thought you’d never come.” granny 

made a long journey outward, looking for hapsy. what if i don’t find her? what then? 
her heart sank down and down, there was no bottom to death, she couldn’t come to 
the end of it. the blue li
