ith black netting and ostrich 
feathers. 

if this was not enough, they wore clip-on earbobs 
of  various  colored  rhinestones  and  circles  of  rouge  on 
their brown cheeks. i thought they were beautiful. 

in addition to  all  these daughters, it turned out 
mary had one son besides jesus, a man named otis hill, 
with stubby teeth, in an oversize navy suit, so technically 
the  group  was  the  daughters  and  son  of  mary.  he'd 
come  with  his  wife,  who  was  known  to  everyone  as 
sugar-girl.  she  wore  a  white  dress,  turquoise  cotton 
gloves, and an emerald green turban on her head.

august  and  june,  hatless,  gloveless,  earbobless, 
looked  practically  poverty-stricken  next  to  them,  but 
may, good old may, had tied on a  bright blue hat with 
the brim up on one side and down on the other. 

august had brought in chairs and arranged them 
in a semicircle facing the wooden statue of mary. when 
we  were  all seated,  she  lit  the candle and june  played

"by  the  time  the  next  sunday  came,  everyone 
had heard about the statue  washing up from the  river, 
how  it  had  spoken  to  obadiah.  the  praise  house  was 
filled with people spilling out the door and sitting on the 
window  ledges.  obadiah  told  them  he  knew  the  lord 
god had sent her, but he didn't know who she was." 

"he didn't know who she was!" cried sugar-girl, 
breaking in to the story. then all the daughters of mary 
broke  loose,  saying  over  and  over,  "not  one  of  them 
knew."

or.  i  thought  this  was  the 
grand  finale,  but  no,  june  switched  over  to  the  piano 
and banged out a jazzed-up version of "go tell it on the 
mountain." that's when august started a conga-line. she 
danced  over  to  lunelle,  who  latched  on  to  august's 
waist.  cressie  hooked  on  to  lunelle,  followed  by 
mabelee, and  off  they  went around the  room,  causing 
cressie to grab hold of her crimson hat. 

when  they  swung  back  by,  queenie  and  violet 
joined them, then sugar-girl.  i wanted  to be  part of it, 
too,  but  i only watched,  and  so  did rosaleen and otis. 
june seemed to play faster and faster. i fanned my face, 
trying to get a little air, feeling light-headed. when the 
dance  ended,  the  daughters  stood  panting  in  a  half 
circle before our lady of chains, and what they did next

touched the statue's fading red heart.

"i'm going to talk to august," i said. 
he  slammed  down  the  hood  and  smeared  his 
hands front and back on his pants. "august is with sugar-
girl  in  the  parlor.  she  showed  up  crying.  something 
about otis  using their life savings to buy a secondhand 
fishing boat." 

"but i've  got something  really important to  talk 

to her about." 

"you'll  have  to  get  in  line,"  he  said.  "come  on,  

we'll be back before sugar-girl leaves." 

i hesitated, then gave in. "all right." 
the  auto-parts  store  sat  two  doors  down  from 
the movie theater. as zach pulled into a parking space in 
front, i saw them—five or six white men standing by the 
ticket  booth.  they milled  around,  casting  quick  glances 
up  and  down  the  sidewalk,  like  they  were  waiting  for 
someone,  all  of  them  so  nicely  dressed,  wearing  ties 
with clips on them like store clerks and bank tellers.

m,  queenie  and  her  daughter,  violet,  had  on  the 
smallest hats in the group, and this time they'd left them 
off completely. i think it was because queenie hated to 
cover the whiteness of her hair, which she was proud to 
have, and violet, who had to be forty at least, couldn't 
bring herself to wear a hat if her mother wasn't wearing 
one.  if  queenie  went  into  the  kitchen  and  stuck  her 
head in the oven, violet would go stick hers in, too. 

lunelle,  mabelee,  cressie,  and  sugar-girl  each 
wore  a  black  hat,  not  as  spectacular  as  the  previous 
ones, except for lunelle's, which had both a red veil and 
a red feather. they took off the hats and lined them up 
on  the  piano  as  soon  as  they  came  in,  so  that  you  
wanted to say, what's the use? 

they got under way slicing ham, laying out fried 
chicken,  shaking  paprika  on  the  deviled  eggs.  we  had

lunelle  said,  "i  drove  in  there  one  time  to  see  
mrs. lamar after she passed, since i used to work for her 
way  back  when.  the  woman  who  sat  in  the  window 
beside her casket used to be the bank teller there, and 
when i drove off, she said, 'you have a nice day now.'" 

i  turned  to  august,  who  was  wiping  her  eyes 
from  tears  of  hilarity.  i  said,  "you  won't  let  them  put  
may in the bank window, will you?" 

"honey,  don't  worry  about  it,"  said  sugar-girl. 
"the  drive-by  window  is  at  the  white  people's  funeral 
home. they're the only ones with enough money to fix 
up something that ridiculous." 

they  all  broke  down  again  with  hysterics,  and  i  
could  not  help  laughing,  too,  partly  with  relief  that 
people would not be joyriding through the funeral home 
to  see  may  and  partly  because  you  could  not  help 
laughing at the sight of all the daughters laughing. 

but i will tell you this secret thing, which not one

said what she did, like i was truly one of them. not one 
person in the room said, sugar-girl, really, talking about 
white  people  like  that  and  we  have  a  white  person 
present. they didn't even think of me being different. 

up until then i'd thought that white people and 
colored people getting along was the big aim, but after 
that i decided everybody being colorless together was a 
better  plan. 
i  thought  of  that  policeman,  eddie 
hazelwurst, saying i'd lowered myself to be in this house 
of colored women, and for the very life of me i couldn't 
understand how it had

mary, comb of honey." 

rosaleen  and  i  brought  up  the  rear,  toting 
candles, too, trying to hum along, since we didn't know 
the words. i cupped one hand around  the flame  of  my 
candle to be sure it didn't blow out. 

at  the  door  of  the  honey  house,  neil  and  zach 
lifted the statue out of the wagon and carried her inside. 
sugar-girl nudged otis with her elbow, and he stepped 
up  and  helped  them  get  her  situated  between  the 
extractor and the baffle tank. 

"all right," august said. "now we'll start the last 
part of our service. why don't you stand in a semicircle 
right here around our lady." 

june  played  us  a  gloomy-sounding  song  on  the 
cello  while  august  retold  black  mary's  story  start  to 
finish.  when  she  got  to  the  part  about  the  slaves 
touching our lady's heart and how she filled th

il and zach stepped out of 
the honey  house  carrying our lady; it  got my mind off 
the trailways bus. they carried her under their arms like 
a tube of carpet, with the chains slapping back and forth 
against her body. you'd think they would use the wagon 
again, something a little more dignified than this. and if 
that wasn't bad enough, when they set her down, they 
deposited her in the middle of an anthill, which started 
an ant stampede. we had to jump around, shaking them 
off our feet. sugar-girl's wig, which for some reason she 
insisted on calling a "wig hat," had slid down toward her 
eyebrows from the jumping around, so we had to have 
time  out  for  her  to  go  inside  and  adjust  it.  otis  yelled 
after her, "i told you not to wear that thing, it's too hot 
for  a  wig.  it's  sliding  around  on  your  head  from  the 
perspiration." 

"if i wanna wear my wig hat, i'm gonna wear it," 

she said over her shoulder. 

"don't we know it," he snapped back, looking at 
us like we w

we just didn't like otis giving her orders. 

when all  that  finally  settled  down,  august  said, 

"well, here we are, and here's our lady." 

i looked her over, proud of how clean she was. 
august  read  mary's words from  the bible:  "'for 
behold  from  henceforth  all  generations  shall  call  me 
blessed—"'" 

"blessed mary," violet interrupted. 
"blessed, blessed ma

ugh the clouds. "blessed mary," she said one more 
time. 

"today  we're  celebrating  the  assumption  of 
mary,"  august  said.  "we're  celebrating  how  she  woke 
from her sleep and rose into heaven. and we're here to 
remember  the  story  of  our  lady  of  chains,  to  remind 
ourselves that those chains could never keep her down. 
our lady broke free of them every time." 

august  grabbed  hold  of  the  chain  around  black 
mary  and  unwrapped  a  loop  before  handing  it  off  to 
sugar-girl, who unwrapped it a little further. every one 
of  us  got  to  join  in  taking  off  a  loop  of  chain.  what  i  
remember is the clinking noise it made as it uncoiled in a

the  front  door  opened,  and  queenie,  violet, 
lunelle,  and  mabelee  stumbled  into  the  house,  all 
wound  up  and  looking  like  they  had  their  clothes  on 
backward. queenie stared at my cheek. 

"everybody all right?" she said, out of breath. 
"we're all right," said august. "this is mr. owens, 

lily's father. he came for a visit." 

"i didn't get an answer at sugar-girl's or cressie's 

house,"

us,  clutching their  pocketbooks  up against their  bodies 
like they might have to use them to beat the living hell 
out of somebody. 

i wondered how we must look to him. a bunch of 
women—mabelee four foot ten, lunelle's hair standing 
straight  up  on  her  head  begging  to  be  braided,  violet 
muttering,  "blessed  mary,"  and  queenie—tough  old 
queenie—with her hands on her hips and her l
