r still. following the pathbreaking and ultimately
nobel  prize–winning  work  of  glashow,  salam,  and  weinberg  that  established  a  deep  connection
between the electromagnetic and weak forces (discussed in chapter 5), in 1974 glashow, together

with his harvard colleague howard georgi, suggested that an analogous connection might be forged
with the strong force. their work, which proposed a "grand unification" of three of the four forces,
differed in one essential way from that of the electroweak theory: whereas the electromagnetic and
weak forces crystallized out of a more symmetric union when the temperature of the universe dropped
to about a million billion degrees above absolute zero (1015 kelvin), georgi and glashow showed
that the union with the strong force would have been apparent only at a temperature some ten trillion
times higher—around ten billion billion billion degrees above absolute zero (1028 kelvin). from the
point of view of energy, this is about a million billion times the
