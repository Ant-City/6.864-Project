'alas!' said aragorn. 'thus passes the heir of denethor, lord of the tower of guard! this is a bitter end. now the company is all in ruin. it is i that have failed. vain was gandalf's trust in me. what shall i do now? boromir has laid it on me to go to minas tirith, and my heart desires it; but where are the ring and the bearer? how shall i find them and save the quest from disaster?'
he knelt for a while, bent with weeping, still clasping boromir's hand. so it was that legolas and gimli found him. they came from the western slopes of the hill, silently, creeping through the trees as if they were hunting. gimli had his axe in hand, and legolas his long knife: all his arrows were spent. when they came into the glade they halted in amazement; and then they stood a moment with heads bowed in grief, for it seemed to them plain what had happened.
'alas!' said legolas, coming to aragorn's side. 'we have hunted and slain many orcs in the woods, but we should have been of mor

. he fell defending the hobbits, while i was away upon the hill.'
'the hobbits!' cried gimli 'where are they then? where is frodo?'
'i do not know,' answered aragorn wearily. 'before he died boromir told me that the orcs had bound them; he did not think that they were dead. i sent him to follow merry and pippin; but i did not ask him if frodo or sam were with him: not until it was too late. all that i have done today has gone amiss. what is to be done now?'
'first we must tend the fallen,' said legolas. 'we cannot leave him lying like carrion among these foul orcs.'
'but we must be swift,' said gimli. 'he would not wish us to linger. we must follow the orcs, if there is hope that any of our company are living prisoners.'
'but we do not know whether the ring-bearer is with them or not ' said aragorn. 'are we to abandon him? must we not seek him first? an evil choice is now before us!'
'then let us do first what we must do,' said legolas. 'we have not the time or the tools to bury our comrade f

 knives, leaf-bladed, damasked in gold and red; and searching further he found also the sheaths, black, set with small red gems. 'no orc-tools these!' he said. 'they were borne by the hobbits. doubtless the orcs despoiled them, but feared to keep the knives, knowing them for what they are: work of westernesse, wound about with spells for the bane of mordor. well, now, if they still live, our friends are weaponless. i will take these things, hoping against hope, to give them back.'
'and i,' said legolas, 'will take all the arrows that i can find, for my quiver is empty.' he searched in the pile and on the ground about and found not a few that were undamaged and longer in the shaft than such arrows as the orcs were accustomed to use. he looked at them closely.
and aragorn looked on the slain, and he said: 'here lie many that are not folk of mordor. some are from the north, from the misty mountains, if i know anything of orcs and their kinds. and here are others strange to me. their gear is not

and large hands. they were armed with short broad-bladed swords, not with the curved scimitars usual with orcs: and they had bows of yew, in length and shape like the bows of men. upon their shields they bore a strange device: a small white hand in the centre of a black field; on the front of their iron helms was set an s-rune, wrought of some white metal.
'i have not seen these tokens before,' said aragorn. 'what do they mean?'
's is for sauron,' said gimli. 'that is easy to read.'
'nay!' said legolas. 'sauron does not use the elf-runes.'
'neither does he use his right name, nor permit it to be spelt or spoken,' said aragorn. 'and he does not use white. the orcs in the service of barad-d√ªr use the sign of the red eye.' he stood for a moment in thought. 's is for saruman, i guess,' he said at length. 'there is evil afoot in isengard, and the west is no longer safe. it is as gandalf feared: by some means the traitor saruman has had news of our journey. it is likely too that he knows of gandal

taking his axe the dwarf now cut several branches. these they lashed together with bowstrings, and spread their cloaks upon the frame. upon this rough bier they carried the body of their companion to the shore, together with such trophies of his last battle as they chose to send forth with him. it was only a short way, yet they found it no easy task, for boromir was a man both tall and strong.
at the water-side aragorn remained, watching the bier. while legolas and gimli hastened back on foot to parth galen. it was a mile or more, and it was some time before they came back, paddling two boats swiftly along the shore.
'there is a strange tale to tell!' said legolas. 'there are only two boats upon the bank. we could find no trace of the other.'
'have orcs been there?' asked aragorn.
'we saw no signs of them,' answered gimli. 'and orcs would have taken or destroyed all the boats, and the baggage as well.'
'i will look at the ground when we come there,' s

'what news from the west, o wandering wind, do you bring to me tonight?
have you seen boromir the tall by moon or by starlight?'
'i saw him ride over seven streams, over waters wide and grey;
i saw him walk in empty lands, until he passed away
into the shadows of the north. i saw him then no more.
the north wind may have heard the horn of the son of denethor.'
'o boromir! from the high walls westward i looked afar,
but you came not from the empty lands where no men are.'
then legolas sang:
from the mouths of the sea the south wind flies, from the sandhills and the stones;
the wailing of the gulls it bears, and at the gate it moans.
'what news from the south, o sighing wind, do you bring to me at eve?
where now is boromir the fair? he tarries and i grieve.'
'ask not of me where he doth dwell-so many bones there lie
on the white shores and the dark shores under the stormy sky;
so many have passed down anduin to find the flowing sea.

. he guessed his master s mind and came back here before frodo had gone. he did not find it easy to leave sam behind!'
'but why should he leave us behind, and without a word?' said gimli. 'that was a strange deed!'
'and a brave deed,' said aragorn. 'sam was right, i think. frodo did not wish to lead any friend to death with him in mordor. but he knew that he must go himself. something happened after he left us that overcame his fear and doubt.'
'maybe hunting orcs came on him and he fled,' said legolas.
'he fled, certainly,' said aragorn, 'but not, i think, from orcs.' what he thought was the cause of frodo's sudden resolve and flight aragorn did not say. the last words of boromir he long kept secret.
'well, so much at least is now clear,' said legolas: 'frodo is no longer on this side of the river: only he can have taken the boat. and sam is with him; only he would have taken his pack.'
'our choice then,' said gimli, 'is either to take the remaining boat and follow frodo, or else to follow t

they drew up the last boat and carried it to the trees. they laid beneath it such of their goods as they did not need and could not carry away. then they left parth galen. the afternoon was fading as they came back to the glade where boromir had fallen. there they picked up the trail of the orcs. it needed little skill to find.
'no other folk make such a trampling,' said legolas. 'it seems their delight to slash and beat down growing things that are not even in their way.'
'but they go with a great speed for all that,' said aragorn, 'and they do not tire. and later we may have to search for our path in hard bare lands.'
'well, after them!' said gimli. 'dwarves too can go swiftly, and they do not tire sooner than orcs. but it will be a long chase: they have a long start.'
'yes,' said aragorn, 'we shall all need the endurance of dwarves. but come! with hope or without ho

imbing to the crest of the first and tallest ridge, and down again into the darkness of a deep winding valley on the other side.
there in the still cool hour before dawn they rested for a brief space. the moon had long gone down before them, the stars glittered above them; the first light of day had not yet come over the dark hills behind. for the moment aragorn was at a loss: the orc-trail had descended into the valley, but there it had vanished.
'which way would they turn, do you think?' said legolas. 'northward to take a straighter road to isengard, or fangorn, if that is their aim as you guess? or southward to strike the entwash?'
'they will not make for the river, whatever mark they aim at'' said aragorn. 'and unless there is much amiss in rohan and the power of saruman is greatly increased; they will take the shortest way that they can find over the fields of the rohirrim. let us search northwards!'
the dale ran like a stony trough between the ridged hills, and a trickling stream flowed

'we have already overtaken some of those that we are hunting,' he said. 'look!' he pointed, and they saw that what they had at first taken to be boulders lying at the foot of the slope were huddled bodies. five dead orcs lay there. they had been hewn with many cruel strokes, and two had been beheaded. the ground was wet with their dark blood.
'here is another riddle!' said gimli. 'but it needs the light of

day and for that we cannot wait.'
'yet however you read it, it seems not unhopeful,' said legolas. 'enemies of the orcs are likely to be our friends. do any folk dwell in these hills?'
'no,' said aragorn. 'the rohirrim seldom come here, and it is far from minas tirith. it might be that some company of men were hunting here for reasons that we do not know. yet i think not.'
'what do you think?' said gimli.
'i think that the enemy brought his own enemy with him,' answered aragorn. 'these are northern orcs from far away. among the slain are none of the great orcs with the strange badges. there

n the mountains and the sea?
now let us go!' he said, drawing his eyes away from the south, and looking out west and north to the way that he must tread.
the ridge upon which the companions stood went down steeply before their feet. below it twenty fathoms or more, there was a wide and rugged shelf which ended suddenly in the brink of a sheer cliff: the east wall of rohan. so ended the emyn muil, and the green plains of the rohirrim stretched away before them to the edge of sight.
'look!' cried legolas, pointing up into the pale sky above them. 'there is the eagle again! he is very high. he seems to be flying now away, from this land back to the north. he is going with great speed. look!'
'no, not even my eyes can see him, my good legolas,' said aragorn. 'he must be far aloft indeed. i wonder what is his errand, if he is the same bird that i have seen before. but look! i can see something nearer at hand and more urgent; there is something moving over the plain!'
'many things,' said legolas. '

 suddenness on the grass of rohan. it swelled like a green sea up to the very foot of the emyn muil. the falling stream vanished into a deep growth of cresses and water-plants, and they could hear it tinkling away in green tunnels, down long gentle slopes towards the fens of entwash vale far away. they seemed to have left winter clinging to the hills behind. here the air was softer and warmer, and faintly scented, as if spring was already stirring and the sap was flowing again in herb and leaf. legolas took a deep breath, like one that drinks a great draught after long thirst in barren places.
'ah! the green smell!' he said. 'it is better than much sleep. let us run!'
'light feet may run swiftly here,' said aragorn. 'more swiftly, maybe, than iron-shod orcs. now we have a chance to lessen their lead!'
they went in single file, running like hounds on a strong scent, and an eager light was in their eyes. nearly due west the broad swath of the marching orcs tramped its ugly slot; the sweet grass

 behind and in front, and then they curved sharply back again and were lost in the trampling. at the furthest point aragorn stooped and picked up something from the grass; then he ran back.
'yes,' he said, 'they are quite plain: a hobbit's footprints. pippin's i think. he is smaller than the other. and look at this! he held up a thing that glittered in the sunlight. it looked like the new-opened leaf of a beech-tree, fair and strange in that treeless plain.
'the brooch of an elven-cloak!' cried legolas and gimli together.
'not idly do the leaves of l√≥rien fall,' said aragorn. 'this did not drop by chance: it was cast away as a token to any that might follow. i think pippin ran away from the trail for that purpose.'
'then he at least was alive,' said gimli. 'and he had the use of his wits, and of his legs too. that is heartening. we do not pursue in vain.'
'let us hope that he did not pay too dearly for his boldness,' said legolas. 'come! let us go on! the thought of those merry young folk dr

far ahead. no longer could any sight of them be seen in the level plains.
as nightshade was closing about them aragorn halted. only twice in the day's march had they rested for a brief while, and twelve leagues now lay between them and the eastern wall where they had stood at dawn.
'we have come at last to a hard choice,' he said. 'shall we rest by night, or shall we go on while our will and strength hold?'
'unless our enemies rest also, they will leave us far behind, if we stay to sleep.' said legolas. 'surely even orcs must pause on the march?' said gimli. 'seldom will orcs journey in the open under the sun. yet these have done so,' said legolas. 'certainly they will not rest by night.'
'but if we walk by night, we cannot follow their trail,' said gimli.
'the trail is straight, and turns neither right nor left, as far as my eyes can see,' said legolas.
'maybe, i could lead you at guess in the darkness and hold to the line,' said aragorn; 'but if we strayed, or they turned aside, then when l

mordor, we might pass the signs and never know it.'
'that is true,' said aragorn. 'but if i read the signs back yonder rightly, the orcs of the white hand prevailed, and the whole company is now bound for isengard. their present course bears me out.'
'yet it would be rash to be sure of their counsels,' said gimli. 'and what of escape? in the dark we should have passed the signs that led you to the brooch.'
'the orcs will be doubly on their guard since then, and the prisoners even wearier,' said legolas. 'there will be no escape again, if we do not contrive it. how that is to be done cannot be guessed, but first we must overtake them.'
'and yet even i, dwarf of many journeys, and not the least hardy of my folk, cannot run all the way to isengard without any pause ' said gimli. 'my heart burns me too, and i would have started sooner but now i must rest a little to run the better. and if we rest, then the blind night is the time to do so.'
'i said that it was a hard choice,' said aragorn. 'how s

hall we end this debate?'
'you are our guide,' said gimli, 'and you are skilled in the chase. you shall choose.'
'my heart bids me go on,' said legolas. 'but we must hold together. i will follow your counsel.'
'you give the choice to an ill chooser,' said aragorn. 'since we passed through the argonath my choices have gone amiss.' he fell silent gazing north and west into the gathering night for a long while.
'we will not walk in the dark,' he said at length. 'the peril of missing the trail or signs of other coming and going seems to me the greater. if the moon gave enough light, we would use it, but alas! he sets early and is yet young and pal

be more needed where it is bestowed,' said aragorn. 'with him lies the true quest. ours is but a small matter in the great deeds of this time. a vain pursuit from its beginning, maybe, which no choice of mine can mar or mend. well, i have chosen. so let us use the time as best we may!'
he cast himself on the ground and fell at once into sleep, for he had not slept since their night under the shadow of tol brandir. before dawn was in the sky he woke and rose. gimli was still deep in slumber, but legolas was standing, gazing northwards into the darkness, thoughtful and silent as a young tree in a windless night.
'they are far far away,' he said sadly, turning to aragorn. 'i know in my heart that they have not rested this night. only an eagle could overtake them now.'
'nonetheless we will still follow as we may,' said aragorn. stooping he roused the dwarf. 'come! we must go,' he said. 'the scent is growing cold.'
'but it is still dark,' said gimli. 'even legolas on a hill-top could not see them

till the sun is up.'
'i fear they have passed beyond my sight from hill or plain, under moon or sun,' said legolas.
'where sight fails the earth may bring us rumour,' said aragorn. 'the land must groan under their hated feet.' he stretched himself upon the ground with his ear pressed against the turf. he lay there motionless, for so long a time that gimli wondered if he had swooned or fallen asleep again. dawn came glimmering, and slowly a grey light grew about them. at last he rose, and now his friends could see his face: it was pale and drawn, and his look was troubled.
'the rumour of the earth is dim and

 confused,' he said. 'nothing walks upon it for many miles about us. faint and far are the feet of our enemies. but loud are the hoofs of the horses. it comes to my mind that i heard them, even as i lay on the ground in sleep, and they troubled my dreams: horses galloping, passing in the west. but now they are drawing ever further from us, riding northward. i wonder what is happening in this land!'
'let us go!' said legolas.
so the third day of their pursuit began. during all its long hours of cloud and fitful sun they hardly paused, now striding, now running, as if no weariness could quench the fire that burned them. they seldom spoke. over the wide solitude they passed and their elven-cloaks faded against the background of the grey-green fields; even in the cool sunlight of mid-day few but elvish eyes would have marked them, until they were close at hand. often in their hearts they thanked the lady of l√≥rien fo

 herdsmen had wandered much, living in camp and tent, even in winter-time. but now all the land was empty, and there was silence that did not seem to be the quiet of peace.
at dusk they halted again. now twice twelve leagues they had passed over the plains of rohan and the wall of the emyn muil was lost in the shadows of the east. the young moon was glimmering in a misty sky, but it gave small light, and the stars were veiled.
'now do i most grudge a time of rest or any halt in our chase ' said legolas. 'the orcs have run before us, as if the very whips of sauron were behind them. i fear they have already reached the forest and the dark hills, and even now are passing into the shadows of the trees.'
gimli ground his teeth. 'this is a bitter end to our hope and to all our toil!' he said.
'to hope, maybe, but not to toil,' said aragorn. 'we shall not turn back here. yet i am weary.' he gazed back along the way that they had come towards the night gathering in the east. 'there is something stran

ge at work in this land. i distrust the silence. i distrust even the pale moon. the stars are faint; and i am weary as i have seldom been before, weary as no ranger should be with a clear trail to follow. there is some will that lends speed to our foes and sets an unseen barrier before us: a weariness that is in the heart more than in the limb.'
'truly!' said legolas. 'that i have known since first we came down from the emyn muil. for the will is not behind us but before us.' he pointed away over the land of rohan into the darkling west under the sickle moon. 'saruman!' muttered aragorn. 'but he shall not turn us back! halt we must once more; for, see! even the moon is falling into gathering cloud. but north lies our road between down and fen when day returns.'
as before legolas was first afoot, if indeed he had ever slept. 'awake! awake!' he cried. 'it is

 of sunken land, some ten miles wide, lay between them and the river wandering deep in dim thickets of reed and rush. just to the west of the southernmost slope there was a great ring, where the turf had been torn and beaten by many trampling feet. from it the orc-trail ran out again, turning north along the dry skirts of the hills. aragorn halted and examined the tracks closely.
'they rested here a while,' he said, 'but even the outward trail is already old. i fear that your heart spoke truly, legolas: it is thrice twelve hours, i guess, since the orcs stood where we now stand. if they held to their pace, then at sundown yesterday they would reach the borders of fangorn.'
'i can see nothing away north or west but grass dwindling into mist,' said gimli. 'could we see the forest, if we climbed the hills?'
'it is still far away,' said aragorn. 'if i remember rightly, these downs run eight leagues or more to the north, and then north-west to the issuing of the entwash there lies still a wide lan

orget the miles. they would be more willing, if my heart were less heavy.'
the sun was sinking when at last they drew near to the end of the line of downs. for many hours they had marched without rest. they were going slowly now, and gimli's back was bent. stone-hard are the dwarves in labour or journey, but this endless chase began to tell on him, as all hope failed in his heart. aragorn walked behind him, grim and silent, stooping now and again to scan some print or mark upon the ground. only legolas still stepped as lightly as ever, his feet hardly seeming to press the grass. leaving no footprints as he passed; but in the waybread of the elves he found all the sustenance that he needed, and he could sleep, if sleep it could be called by men, resting his mind in the strange paths of elvish dreams, even as he walked open-eyed in the light of this world.
'let us go up on to this green hill!' he said. wearily they followed him, climbing the long slope, until they came out upon the top. it was

erly of the downs. the sun sank and the shadows of evening fell like a curtain. they were alone in a grey formless world without mark or measure. only far away north-west there was a deeper darkness against the dying light: the mountains of mist and the forest at their feet.
'nothing can we see to guide us here,' said gimli. 'well, now we must halt again and wear the night away. it is growing cold!'
'the wind is north from the snows,' said aragorn.
'and ere morning it will be in the east,' said legolas. 'but rest if you must. yet do not cast all hope away. tomorrow is unknown. rede oft is found at the rising of the sun.'
'three suns already have risen on our chase and brought no counsel ' said gimli.
the night grew ever colder. aragorn and gimli slept fitfully, and whenever they awoke they saw legolas standing beside them, or walking to and fro, singing softly to himself in his own tongue, and as he sang the white stars opened in the hard black vault above. so the night passed. together they

away, as if floating on a grey cloud, the white head of tall methedras, the last peak of the misty mountains. out of the forest the entwash flowed to meet them, its stream now swift and narrow, and its banks deep-cloven. the orc-trail turned from the downs towards it.
following with his keen eyes the trail to the river, and then the river back towards the forest, aragorn saw a shadow on the distant green, a dark swift-moving blur. he cast himself upon the ground and listened again intently. but legolas stood beside him, shading his bright elven-eyes with his long slender hand, and he saw not a shadow, nor a blur, but the small figures of horsemen, many horsemen, and the glint of morning on the tips of their spears was like the twinkle of minute stars beyond the edge of mortal sight. far behind them a dark smoke rose in thin curling threads.
there was a silence in the empty fields, arid gimli could hear the air moving in the grass.
'riders!' cried aragorn, springing to his feet. 'many riders o

n swift steeds are coming towards us!'
'yes,' said legolas, 'there are one hundred and five. yellow is their hair, and bright are their spears. their leader is very tall.'
aragorn smiled. 'keen are the eyes of the elves,' he said.
'nay! the riders are little more than five leagues distant,' said legolas.
'five leagues or one,' said gimli; 'we cannot escape them in this bare land. shall we wait for them here or go on our way?'
'we will wait,' said aragorn. 'i am weary, and our hunt has failed. or at least others were before us; for these horsemen are riding back down the orc-trail. we may get new s from them.'
'or spears,' said gimli.
'there are three empty saddles, but i see no hobbits,' said legolas.
'i did not say that we should hear good news,' said aragorn. 'but evil or good we will await

'but gandalf spoke of a rumour that they pay tribute to mordor ' said gimli.
'i believe it no more than did boromir,' answered aragorn.
'you will soon learn the truth,' said legolas. 'already they approach.'
at length even gimli could hear the distant beat of galloping hoofs. the horsemen, following the trail, had turned from the river, and were drawing near the downs. they were riding like the wind.
now the cries of clear strong voices came ringing over the fields. suddenly they swept up with a noise like thunder, and the foremost horseman swerved, passing by the foot of the hill, and leading the host back southward along the western skirts of the downs. after him they ro

'that is no name for a man that you give. and strange too is your raiment. have you sprung out of the grass? how did you escape our sight? are you elvish folk?'
'no,' said aragorn. 'one only of us is an elf, legolas from the woodland realm in distant mirkwood. but we have passed through lothl√≥rien, and the gifts and favour of the lady go with us.'
the rider looked at them with renewed wonder, but his eyes hardened. 'then there is a lady in the golden wood, as old tales tell!' he said. 'few escape her nets, they say. these are strange days! but if you have her favour, then you also are net-weavers and sorcerers, maybe.' he turned a cold glance suddenly upon legolas and gimli. 'why do you not speak, silent

'then √©omer son of √©omund, third marshal of riddermark, let gimli the dwarf gl√≥in's son warn you against foolish words. you speak evil of that which is fair beyond the reach of your thought, and only little wit can excuse you.'
√©omer's eyes blazed, and the men of rohan murmured angrily, and closed in, advancing their spears. 'i would cut off your head, beard and all, master dwarf, if it stood but a little higher from the ground ' said √©omer.
'he stands not alone,' said legolas, bending his bow and fitting an arrow with hands that moved quicker than sight. 'you would die before your stroke fell.'
√©omer raised his sword, and things might have gone ill, but aragorn sprang between them, and raised his hand. 'your pardon, √©omer!' he cried. 'when you know more you will understand why you have angered my companions. we intend no evil to rohan, nor to any of its folk, neither to man nor to horse. will you not hear our tale before you strike?'
'i will,' said √©omer lowering

aragorn threw back his cloak. the elven-sheath glittered as he grasped it, and the bright blade of and√∫ril shone like a sudden flame as he swept it out. 'elendil!' he cried. 'i am aragorn son of arathorn and am called elessar, the elfstone, d√∫nadan, the heir of isildur elendil's son of gondor. here is the sword that was broken and is forged again! will you aid me or thwart me? choose swiftly!'
gimli and legolas looked at their companion in amazement, for they had not seen him in this mood before. he seemed to have grown in stature while √©omer had shrunk; and in his living face they caught a brief vision of the power and majesty of the kings of stone. for a moment it seemed to the eyes of legolas that a white flame flickered on the brows of aragorn like a shining crown.
√©omer stepped back and a look of awe was in his face. he cast down his proud eyes. 'these are indeed strange days,' he muttered. 'dr

'nonetheless we put an end to them. but we have been too long away. we are needed south and west. will you not come? there are spare horses as you see. there is work for the sword to do. yes, and we could find a use for gimli's axe and the bow of legolas, if they will pardon my rash words concerning the lady of the wood. i spoke only as do all men in my land, and i would gladly learn better.'
'i thank you for your fair words,' said aragorn, 'and my heart desires to come with you; but i cannot desert my friends while hope remains.'
'hope does not remain,' said √©omer. 'you will not find your friends on the north-borders.'
'yet my friends are not behind. we found a clear token not far from the east wall that one at least of them was still alive t

'no one,' said gimli. 'and do not trouble: no one will ever hear of it. i would sooner walk than sit on the back of any beast so great, free or begrudged.'
'but you must ride now, or you will hinder us,' said aragorn.
'come, you shall sit behind me, friend gimli, said legolas. then all will be well, and you need neither borrow a horse nor be troubled by one.'
a great dark-grey horse was brought to aragorn, and he mounted it. 'hasufel is his name,' said √©omer. 'may he bear you well and to better fortune than g√°rulf, his late master!'
a smaller and lighter horse, but restive and fiery, was brought to legolas. arod was his name. but legolas asked them to take off saddle and rein. 'i need them not,' he said, and leaped lightly up, and to their wonder arod was tame and

 and evening soon drew down, dim and misty. by nightfall they had discovered no trace of merry and pippin.
'we can do no more,' said gimli sadly. 'we have been set many riddles since we came to tol brandir, but this is the hardest to unravel. i would guess that the burned bones of the hobbits are now mingled with the orcs'. it will be hard news for frodo, if he lives to hear it; and hard too for the old hobbit who waits in rivendell. elrond was against their coming.'
'but gandalf was not,' said legolas.
'but gandalf chose to come himself, and he was the first to be lost ' answered gimli. 'his foresight failed him.'
'the counsel of gandalf was not founded on foreknowledge of safety, for himself or for others,' said aragorn. 'there are some things that it is better to begin than to refuse, even though the end may be dark. but i shall not depart from this place yet. in any case we must here await the morning-light.'

: it looked like a chestnut, and yet it still bore many broad brown leaves of a former year, like dry hands with long splayed fingers; they rattled mournfully in the night-breeze.
gimli shivered. they had brought only one blanket apiece. 'let us light a fire,' he said. 'i care no longer for the danger. let the orcs come as thick as summer-moths round a candle!'
'if those unhappy hobbits are astray in the woods, it might draw them hither,' said legolas.
'and it might draw other things, neither orc nor hobbit,' said aragorn. 'we are near to the mountain-marches of the traitor saruman. also we are on the very edge of fangorn, and it is perilous to touch the trees of that wood, it is said.'
'but the rohirrim made a great burning here yesterday,' said gimli, 'and they felled trees for the fire, as can be seen. yet they passed the night after safely here, when their labour was ended.'
'they were many,' said aragorn, 'and they do not heed the wrath

 of fangorn, for they come here seldom, and they do not go under the trees. but our paths are likely to lead us into the very forest itself. so have a care! cut no living wood!'
'there is no need,' said gimli. 'the riders have left chip and bough enough, and there is dead wood lying in plenty.' he went off to gather fuel, and busied himself with building and kindling a fire; but aragorn sat silent with his back to the great tree, deep in thought; and legolas stood alone in the open, looking towards the profound shadow of the wood, leaning forward, as one who listens to voices calling from a distance.
when the dwarf had a small bright blaze going, the three companions drew close to it and sat together, shrouding the light with their hooded forms. legolas looked up at the boughs of the tree reaching out above them.
'look!' he said. 'the tree is glad of the fire!'
it may have been that the dancing shadows tricked their eyes, but certainly to each of t

he companions the boughs appeared to be bending this way and that so as to come above the flames, while the upper branches were stooping down; the brown leaves now stood out stiff, and rubbed together like many cold cracked hands taking comfort in the warmth.
there was a silence, for suddenly the dark and unknown forest, so near at hand, made itself felt as a great brooding presence, full of secret purpose. after a while legolas spoke again.
'celeborn warned us not to go far into fangorn,' he said. 'do you know why, aragorn? what are the fables of the forest that boromir had heard?'
'i have heard many tales in gondor and elsewhere,' said aragorn, 'but if it were not for the words of celeborn i should deem them only fables that men have made as true knowledge fades. i had thought of asking you what was the truth of the matter. and if an elf of the wood does not know, how shall a man answer?'
'you have journeyed further

than i,' said legolas. 'i have heard nothing of this in my own land, save only songs that tell how the onodrim, that men call ents, dwelt there long ago; for fangorn is old, old even as the elves would reckon it.'
'yes, it is old,' said aragorn, 'as old as the forest by the barrow-downs, and it is far greater. elrond says that the two are akin, the last strongholds of the mighty woods of the elder days, in which the firstborn roamed while men still slept. yet fangorn holds some secret of its own. what it is i do not

 know.'
'and i do not wish to know,' said gimli. 'let nothing that dwells in fangorn be troubled on my account!'
they now drew lots for the watches, and the lot for the first watch fell to gimli. the others lay down. almost at once sleep laid hold on them. 'gimli!' said aragorn drowsily. 'remember, it is perilous to cut bough or twig from a living tree in fangorn. but do not stray far in search of dead wood. let the fire die rather! call me at need!'
with that he fell asleep. legolas already lay motionless, his fair hands folded upon his breast, his eyes unclosed, blending living night and deep dream, as is the way with elves. gimli sat hunched by the fire, running his thumb thoughtfully along the edge of his axe. the tree rustled. there was no other sound.
suddenly gimli looked up, and there just on the edge of the fire-light stood an old bent man, leaning on a staff, and wrapped in a great cloak; his wide-brimmed hat was pulled down over his eyes. gimli sprang up, too ama

zed for the moment to cry out, though at once the thought flashed into his mind that saruman had caught them. both aragorn and legolas, roused by his sudden movement, sat up and stared. the old man did not speak or make, sign.
'well, father, what can we do for you?' said aragorn, leaping to his feet. 'come and be warm, if you are cold!' he strode forward, but the old man was gone. there was no trace of him to be found near at hand, and they did not dare to wander far. the moon had set and the night was very dark.
suddenly legolas gave a cry. 'the horses! the horses!'
the horses were gone. they had dragged their pickets and dis

es whinnying and neighing. then all was quiet again, except for the cold rustle of the wind.
'well, they are gone,' said aragorn at last. 'we cannot find them or catch them; so that if they do not return of their own will, we must do without. we started on our feet, and we have those still.'
'feet!' said gimli. 'but we cannot eat them as well as walk on them ' he threw some fuel on the fire and slumped down beside it.
'only a few hours ago you were unwilling to sit on a horse of rohan,' laughed legolas. 'you will make a rider yet.'
'it seems unlikely that i shall have the chance,' said gimli.
'if you wish to know what i think,' he began again after a while 'i think it was saruman. who else? remember the words of √©omer: he walks about like an old man hooded and cloaked. those were the words. he has gone off with our horses, or scared them away, and here we are. there is more trouble coming to us, mark my words!'
'i mark them,' said aragorn. 'but i marked also that this old man had a hat not a

 hood. still i do not doubt that you guess right, and that we are in peril here, by night or day. yet in the meantime there is nothing that we can do but rest, while we may. i will watch for a while now, gimli. i have more need of thought than of sleep.'
the night passed slowly. legolas followed aragorn, and gimli followed legolas, and their watches wore away. but nothing happened. the old man did not appear again, and the horses did not return.

the white rider

'my very bones are chilled,' said gimli, flapping his arms and stamping his feet. day had come at last. at dawn the companions had made such breakfast as they could; now in the growing light they were getting ready to search the ground again for signs of the hobbits.
'and do not forget that old man!' said gimli. 'i should be happier if i could see the print of a boot.'
'why would that make you happy?' said legolas.
'because an old man with feet that leave marks might be no more than he seemed,' answered the dwarf.
'maybe,' said the elf; 'but a heavy boot might leave no print here: the grass is deep and springy.'
'that would not baffle a ranger,' said gimli. 'a bent blade is enough for aragorn to read. but i do not expect him to find any traces. it was an evil phantom of saruman that we saw last night. i am sure of it, even under the light of morning. his eyes are looking out on us from fangorn even now,

maybe.'
'it is likely enough,' said aragorn; 'yet i am not sure. i am thinking of the horses. you said last night, gimli, that they were scared away. but i did not think so. did you hear them, legolas? did they sound to you like beasts in terror?'
'no,' said legolas. 'i heard them clearly. but for the darkness and our own fear i should have guessed that they were beasts wild with some sudden gladness. they spoke as horses will when they meet a friend that they have long missed.'
'so i thought,' said aragorn; 'but i cannot read the riddle, unless they return. come! the light is growing fast. let us look first and guess later! we should begin here, near to our own camping-ground, searching carefully all about, and working up the slope towards the forest. to

 some pieces of cut cord lying nearby!'
'and here is the knife that cut them!' said gimli. he stooped and drew out of a tussock, into which some heavy foot had trampled it, a short jagged blade. the haft from which it had been snapped was beside it. 'it was an orc-weapon,' he said, holding it gingerly, and looking with disgust at the carved handle: it had been shaped like a hideous head with squinting eyes and leering mouth.
'well, here is the strangest riddle that we have yet found!' exclaimed legolas. 'a bound prisoner escapes both from the orcs and from the surrounding horsemen. he then stops, while still in the open, and cuts his bonds with an orc-knife. but how and why? for if his legs were tied, how did he walk? and if his arms were tied, how did he use the knife? and if neither were tied, why did he cut the cords at all? being pleased with his skill, he then sat down and quietly ate some waybread! that at least is enough to show that he was a hobbit, without the mallorn-leaf. after tha

t, i suppose, he turned his arms into wings and flew away singing into the trees. it should be easy to find him: we only need wings ourselves!'
'there was sorcery here right enough,' said gimli. 'what was that old man doing? what have you to say, aragorn, to the reading of legolas. can you better it?'
'maybe, i could,' said aragorn, smiling. 'there are some other signs near at hand that you have not considered. i agree that the prisoner was a hobbit and must have had either legs or hands free, before he came here. i guess that it was hands, because the riddle then becomes easier, and also because, as i read the marks, he was carried to this point by an orc. blood was spilled there, a few paces away, orc-blood. there are deep prints of hoofs all about this spot, and signs

hem. then again beneath the bole of a great tree on the very edge of the wood more prints were discovered. the earth was bare and dry, and did not reveal much.
'one hobbit at least stood here for a while and looked back; and then he turned away into the forest,' said aragorn.
'then we must go in, too,' said gimli. 'but i do not like the look of this fangorn: and we were warned against it. i wish the chase had led anywhere else!'
'i do not think the wood feels evil, whatever tales may say,' said legolas. he stood under the eaves of the forest, stooping forward, as if he were listening, and peering with wide eyes into the shadows. 'no, it is not evil; or what evil is in it is far away. i catch only the faintest echoes of dark places where the hearts of the trees are black. there is no malice near us; but there is watchfulness, and anger.'
'well, it has no cause to be angry with me,' said gimli. 'i have done it no harm. '
'that is just as well,' said legolas. 'but nonetheless it has suffered har

'i dare say you could,' snorted gimli. 'you are a wood-elf, anyway, though elves of any kind are strange folk. yet you comfort me. where you go, i will go. but keep your bow ready to hand, and i will keep my axe loose in my belt. not for use on trees,' he added hastily, looking up at the tree under which they stood. 'i do not wish to meet that old man at unawares without an argument ready to hand, that is all. let us go!'
with that the three hunters plunged into the forest of fangorn. legolas and gimli left the tracking to aragorn. there was little for him to see. the floor of the forest was dry and covered with a drift of leaves; but guessing that the fugitives would stay near the water, he returned often to the banks of the stream. so it was that he came upon the place where merry and pippin had drunk and bathed their feet. there plain for all to see were the footprints of two hobbits, one somewhat smaller than the other.
'this is good tidings,' said aragorn. 'yet the marks are tw

t find them soon, we shall be of no use to them, except to sit down beside them and show our friendship by starving together.'
'if that is indeed all we can do, then we must do that,' said aragorn. 'let us go on.'
they came at length to the steep abrupt end of treebeard's hill and looked up at the rock-wall with its rough steps leading to the high shelf. gleams of sun were striking through the hurrying clouds, and the forest now looked less grey and drear.
'let us go up and look about us!' said legolas. 'i will feel my breath short. i should like to taste a freer air for a while.'
the companions climbed up. aragorn came last, moving slowly: he was scanning the steps and ledges closely.
'i am almost sure that the hobbits have been up here,' he said. 'but there are other marks, very strange marks, which i do not understand. i wonder if we can see anything from this ledge which will help us to guess which way they went next?'
he stood up and looked about, but he saw nothing that was of any use.

the shelf faced southward and eastward; but only on the east was the view open. there he could see the heads of the trees descending in ranks towards the plain from which they had come.
'we have journeyed a long way round,' said legolas. 'we could have all come here safe together, if we had left the great river on the second or third day and struck west. few can foresee whither their road will lead them, till they come to its end.'
'but we did not wish to come to fangorn,' said gimli.
'yet here we are-and nicely caught in the net,' said legolas. 'look!'
'look at what?' said gimli.
'there in the trees.'
'where? i have not elf-eyes.'
'hush! speak more softly! look!' said legolas pointing. 'down in the wood, back in the way that

g slowly. it was not far away. it looked like an old beggar-man, walking wearily, leaning on a rough staff. his head was bowed, and he did not look towards them. in other lands they would have greeted him with kind words; but now they stood silent, each feeling a strange expectancy: something was approaching that held a hidden power-or menace.
gimli gazed with wide eyes for a while, as step by step the figure drew nearer. then suddenly, unable to contain himself longer, he burst out: 'your bow, legolas! bend it! get ready! it is saruman. do not let him speak, or put a spell upon us! shoot first!'
legolas took his bow and bent it, slowly and as if some other will resisted him. he held an arrow loosely in his hand but did not fit it to the string. aragorn stood silent, his face was watchful and intent.
'why are you waiting? what is the matter with you?' said gimli in a hissing whisper.
'legolas is right,' said aragorn quietly. 'we may not shoot an old man so, at unawares and unchallenged, whate

and above the hood he wore a wide-brimmed hat, so that all his features were over-shadowed, except for the end of his nose and his grey beard. yet it seemed to aragorn that he caught the gleam of eyes keen and bright from within the shadow of the hooded brows.
at last the old man broke the silence. 'well met indeed, my friends,' he said in a soft voice. 'i wish to speak to you. will you come down or shall i come up?' without waiting for an answer he began to climb.
'now!' said gimli. 'stop him, legolas!'
'did i not say that i wished to speak to you?' said the old man. 'put away that bow, master elf!'
the bow and arrow fell from legolas' hands, and his arms hung loose at his sides.
'and you, master dwarf, pray take your hand from your axe-haft, till i am up! you will not need such arguments.'
gimli started and then stood still as stone, staring, while the old man sprang up the rough steps as nimbly as a goat. all weariness seemed to have left him. as he stepped up on to the shelf there was a g

at comfort you? and now you would like to know where they were taken? well, well, maybe i can give you some news about that. but why are we standing? your errand, you see, is no longer as urgent as you thought. let us sit down and be more at ease.'
the old man turned away and went towards a heap of fallen stones and rock at the foot of the cliff behind. immediately, as if a spell had been removed, the others relaxed and stirred. gimli's hand went at once to his axe-haft. aragorn drew his sword. legolas picked up his bow.
the old man took no notice, but stooped and sat himself on a low flat stone. then his grey cloak drew apart, and they saw, beyond doubt, that he was clothed beneath all in white.
'saruman!' cried gimli, springing towards him with axe in hand. 'speak! tell us where you have hidden our friends! what have you done with them? speak, or i will make a dint in your hat that even a wizard will find it hard to deal with!'
the old man was too quick for him. he sprang to his feet and le

aped to the top of a large rock. there he stood, grown suddenly tall, towering above them. his hood and his grey rags were flung away. his white garments shone. he lifted up his staff, and gimli's axe leaped from his grasp and fell ringing on the ground. the sword of aragorn, stiff in his motionless hand, blazed with a sudden fire. legolas gave a great shout and shot an arrow high into the air: it vanished in a flash of flame.
'mithrandir!' he cried. 'mithrandir!'
'well met, i say to you again. legolas!' said the old man.
they all gazed at him. his hair was white as snow in the sunshine; and gleaming white was his robe; the eyes under his deep brows were bright, piercing as the rays of the sun; power was in his hand. between wonder, joy, and fear they stood and found no words to say.
at last aragorn stirred. 'gandalf!' he said. 'beyond all hope you return to us in our need! what veil was over my sight? gandalf!' gimli said nothing, hut sank to his knees, shading his eyes.

otten. i can see many things far off, but many things that are close at hand i cannot see. tell me of yourselves!'
'what do you wish to know?' said aragorn. 'all that has happened since we parted on the bridge would be a long tale. will you not first give us news of the hobbits? did you find them, and are they safe?'
'no, i did not find them,' said gandalf. 'there was a darkness over the valleys of the emyn muil, and i did not know of their captivity, until the eagle told me.'
'the eagle!' said legolas. 'i have seen an eagle high and far off: the last time was three days ago, above the emyn muil.'
'yes,' said gandalf, 'that was gwaihir the windlord, who rescued me from orthanc. i sent him before me to watch the river and gather tidings. his sight is keen, but he cannot see all that passes under hill and tree. some things he has seen, and others i have seen myself. the ring now has passed beyond my help, or the help of any of the company that set out from rivendell. very nearly it was revealed

 to the enemy, but it escaped. i had some part in that: for i sat in a high place, and i strove with the dark tower; and the shadow passed. then i was weary, very weary; and i walked long in dark thought.'
'then you know about frodo!' said gimli. 'how do things go with him?'
'i cannot say. he was saved from a great peril, but many lie before him still. he resolved to go alone to mordor, and he set out: that is all that i can say.'
'not alone,' said legolas. 'we think that sam went with him.'
'did he!' said gandalf, and there was a gleam in his eye and a smile on his face. 'did he indeed? it is news to me, yet it does not surprise me. good! very good! you lighten my heart. you must tell me more. now sit by me and tell me the tale of your journey.'
the companions sat on the ground at his feet, and aragorn took up the tale. for a long while gandalf said nothing, and he asked no questions. his hands were spread upon his knees, and his eyes were close

 he came too late, for once, and the battle was over and beyond his help before he reached these parts. he did not remain here long. i look into his mind and i see his doubt. he has no woodcraft. he believes that the horsemen slew and burned all upon the field of battle; but he does not know whether the orcs were bringing any prisoners or not. and he does not know of the quarrel between his servants and the orcs of mordor; nor does he know of the winged messenger.'
'the winged messenger!' cried legolas. 'i shot at him with the bow of galadriel above sarn gebir, and i felled him from the sky. he filled us all with fear. what new terror is this?'
'one that you cannot slay with arrows,' said gandalf. 'you only slew his steed. it was a good deed; but the rider was soon horsed again. for he was a nazg√ªl, one of the nine, who ride now upon winged steeds. soon their terror will overshadow the last armies of our friends, cutting off the sun. but they have not yet been allowed to cross the river, and

'good, good!' said gimli. 'i am glad that it was not you.'
gandalf laughed again. 'yes, my good dwarf,' he said, 'it is a comfort not to be mistaken at all points. do i not know it only too well! but, of course, i never blamed you for your welcome of me. how could i do so, who have so often counselled my friends to suspect even their own hands when dealing with the enemy. bless you, gimli, son of gl√≥in! maybe you will see us both together one day and judge between us!'
'but the hobbits!' legolas broke in. 'we have come far to seek them, and you seem to know where they are. where are they now?'
'with treebeard and the ents,' said gandalf.
'the ents!' exclaimed aragorn. 'then there is truth in the old legends about the dwellers in the deep forests and the giant shepherds of the trees? are there still ents in the world? i thought they were only a memory of ancient days, if indeed they were ever more than a legend of rohan.'
'a legend of rohan!' cried legolas. 'nay, every elf in wilderland

'ah! now you are asking much,' said gandalf. 'the little that i know of his long slow story would make a tale for which we have no time now. treebeard is fangorn, the guardian of the forest; he is the oldest of the ents, the oldest living thing that still walks beneath the sun upon this middle-earth. i hope indeed, legolas, that you may yet meet him. merry and pippin have been fortunate: they met him here, even where we sit. for he came here two days ago and bore them away to his dwelling far off by the roots of the mountains. he often comes here, especially when his mind is uneasy, and rumours of the world outside trouble him. i saw him four days ago striding among the trees, and i think he saw me, for he paused; but i did not speak, for i was heavy with thought, and weary after my struggle with the eye of mordo

r; and he did not speak either, nor call my name.'
'perhaps he also thought that you were saruman,' said gimli. 'but you speak of him as if he was a friend. i thought fangorn was dangerous.'
'dangerous!' cried gandalf. 'and so am i, very dangerous: more dangerous than anything you will ever meet, unless you are brought alive before the seat of the dark lord. and aragorn is dangerous, and legolas is dangerous. you are beset with dangers, gimli son of gl√≥in; for you are dangerous yourself, in your own fashion. certainly the forest of fangorn is perilous-not least to those that are too ready with their axes; and fangorn himself, he is perilous too; yet he is wise and kindly nonetheless. but now his long slow wrath is brimming over, and all the forest is filled with it. the coming of the hobbits and the tidings that they brought have spilled it: it will soon be running like a flood; but i

'what will they do?' asked legolas in astonishment.
'i do not know,' said gandalf. 'i do not think they know themselves. i wonder.' he fell silent, his head bowed in thought.
the others looked at him. a gleam of sun through fleeting clouds fell on his hands, which lay now upturned on his lap: they seemed to be filled with light as a cup is with water. at last he looked up and gazed straight at the sun.
'the morning is wearing away,' he said. 'soon we must go.'
'do we go to find our friends and to see treebeard?' asked aragorn.

the choice was just, and it has been rewarded. for so we have met in time, who otherwise might have met too late. but the quest of your companions is over. your next journey is marked by your given word. you must go to edoras and seek out th√©oden in his hall. for you are needed. the light of and√∫ril must now be uncovered in the battle for which it has so long waited. there is war in rohan, and worse evil: it goes ill with th√©oden.'
'then are we not to see the merry young hobbits again?' said legolas.
'i did not say so,' said gandalf. 'who knows? have patience. go where you must go, and hope! to edoras! i go thither also.'
'it is a long way for a man to walk, young or old,' said aragorn. 'i fear the battle will be over long ere i come there.'
'we shall see, we shall see,' said gandalf. 'will you come now with me?'
'yes, we will set out together,' said aragorn. 'but i do not doubt that you will come there before me, if you wish.' he rose and looked long at gandalf. the others gazed at them i

as if with some light kindled within, bent, laden with years, but holding a power beyond the strength of kings.
'do i not say truly, gandalf,' said aragorn at last, 'that you could go whithersoever you wished quicker than i? and this i also say: you are our captain and our banner. the dark lord has nine. but we have one, mightier than they: the white rider. he has passed through the fire and the abyss, and they shall fear him. we will go where he leads.'
'yes, together we will follow you,' said legolas. 'but first, it would ease my heart, gandalf, to hear what befell you in moria. will you not tell us? can you not stay even to tell your friends how you were delivered?'
'i have stayed already too long,' answered gandalf. 'time is short. but if there were a year to spend, i would not tell you all.'
'then tell us what you will, and time allows!' said gimli. 'come, gandalf, tell us how you fared with the balrog!'
'name him not!' said gandalf, and for a moment it seemed that a cloud of pain passed

if thou hearest the cry of the gull on the shore,
thy heart shall then rest in the forest no more.'
gandalf fell silent and shut his eyes.
'then she sent me no message?' said gimli and bent his head.
'dark are her words,' said legolas, 'and little do they mean to those that receive them.'
'that is no comfort,' said gimli.

ing from his seat. 'come! we have spent all the time that is allowed to a meeting of parted friends. now there is need of haste.'
he wrapped himself again in his old tattered cloak, and led the way. following him they descended quickly from the high shelf and made their way back through the forest, down the bank of the entwash. they spoke no more words, until they stood again upon the grass beyond the eaves of fangorn. there was no sign of their horses to be seen.
'they have not returned,' said legolas. 'it will be a weary walk!'
'i shall not walk. time presses,' said gandalf. then lifting up his head he gave a long whistle. so clear and piercing was the note that the others stood amazed to hear such a sound come from those old bearded lips. three times he whistled; and then faint and far off it seemed to them that they heard the whinny of a horse borne up from the plains upon the eastern wind. they waited wondering. before long there came the sound of hoofs, at first hardly more than a tremo

r of the ground perceptible only to aragorn as he lay upon the grass, then growing steadily louder and clearer to a quick beat.
'there is more than one horse coming,' said aragorn.
'certainly,' said gandalf. 'we are too great a burden for one.'
'there are three,' said legolas, gazing out over the plain. 'see how they run! there is hasufel, and there is my friend arod beside him! but there is another that strides ahead: a very great horse. i have not seen his like before.'
'nor will you again,' said gandalf. 'that is shadowfax. he is the chief of the mearas, lords of horses, and not even th√©oden, king of rohan, has ever looked on a better. does he not shine like silver, and run as smoothly as a swift stream? he has come for me: the horse of the white rider. we are g

soon the other horses came up and stood quietly by, as if awaiting orders. 'we go at once to meduseld, the hall of your master, th√©oden,' said gandalf, addressing them gravely. they bowed their heads. 'time presses, so with your leave, my friends, we will ride. we beg you to use all the speed that you can. hasufel shall bear aragorn and arod legolas. i will set gimli before me, and by his leave shadowfax shall bear us both. we will wait now only to drink a little.'
'now i understand a part of last night's riddle,' said legolas as he sprang lightly upon arod's back. 'whether they fled at first in fear, or not, our horses met shadowfax, their chieftain, and greeted him with joy. did you know that he was at hand, gandalf?'
'yes, i knew,' said the wizard. 'i bent my thought upon him, bidding him to make haste; for yesterday he was far away in

sky down into the west. looking out over the great plain, far away the riders saw it for a moment like a red fire sinking into the grass. low upon the edge of sight shoulders of the mountains glinted red upon either side. a smoke seemed to rise up and darken the sun's disc to the hue of blood, as if it had kindled the grass as it passed down under the rim of earth.
'there lies the gap of rohan,' said gandalf. 'it is now almost due west of us. that way lies isengard.'
'i see a great smoke,' said legolas. 'what may that be?'
'battle and war!' said gandalf. 'ride on!'

chapter 6

the king of the golden hall

they rode on through sunset, and slow dusk, and gathering night. when at last they halted and dismounted, even aragorn was stiff and weary. gandalf only allowed them a few hours' rest. legolas and gimli slept and aragorn lay flat, stretched upon his back; but gandalf stood, leaning on his staff, gazing into the darkness, east and west. all was silent, and there was no sign or sound of living

he light of dawn, winding their way into the heart of the great mountains. immediately before the travellers the widest of these glens opened like a long gulf among the hills. far inward they glimpsed a tumbled mountain-mass with one tall peak; at the mouth of the vale there stood like sentinel a lonely height. about its feet there flowed, as a thread of silver, the stream that issued from the dale; upon its brow they caught, still far away, a glint in the rising sun, a glimmer of gold. 'speak, legolas!' said gandalf. 'tell us what you see there before us!'
legolas gazed ahead, shading his eyes from the level shafts of the new-risen sun. 'i see a white stream that comes down from the snows,' he said. 'where it issues from the shadow of the vale a green hill rises upon the east. a dike and mighty wall and thorny fence encircle it. within there rise the roofs of houses; and in the midst, set upon a green terrace, there stands aloft a great hall of men. and it seems to my eyes that it is thatche

'seven mounds upon the left, and nine upon the right,' said aragorn. 'many long lives of men it is since the golden hall was built.'
'five hundred times have the red leaves fallen in mirkwood in my home since then,' said legolas, 'and but a little while does that seem to us.'
'but to the riders of the mark it seems so long ago,' said aragorn, 'that the raising of this house is but a memory of song, and the years before are lost in the mist of time. now they call this land their home, their own, and their speech is sundered from their northern kin.' then he began to chant softly in a slow tongue unknown to the elf and dwarf; yet they listened, for there was a strong music in it.

'well do you see and speak,' said the wizard. 'for i am gandalf. i have returned. and behold! i too bring back a horse. here is shadowfax the great, whom no other hand can tame. and here beside me is aragorn son of arathorn, the heir of kings, and it is to mundburg that he goes. here also are legolas the elf and gimli the dwarf, our comrades. go now and say to your master that we are at his gates and would have speech with him, if he will permit us to come into his hall.' 'strange names you give indeed! but i will report them as you bid and learn my master's will,' said the guard. 'wait here a little while, and f will bring you such answer as seems good to him. do not hope too much! these are dark days.' he went swiftly away, leaving the strangers in the watchful keeping of his comrades. af

alf stepped out upon the paved terrace at the stairs head. then suddenly with clear voices they spoke a courteous greeting in their own tongue.
hail, corners from afar!' they said, and they turned the hilts of their swords towards the travellers in token of peace. green gems flashed in the sunlight. then one of the guards stepped forward and spoke in the common speech.
'i am the doorward of th√©oden,' he said. 'h√°ma is my name. here i must bid you lay aside your weapons before you enter.'
then legolas gave into his hand his silver-hafted knife, his quiver and his bow. 'keep these well,' he said, 'for they come from the golden wood and the lady of lothl√≥rien gave them to me.'
wonder came into the man's eyes, and he laid the weapons hastily by the wall, as if he feared to handle them. 'no man will touch them i promise you,' he said.
aragorn stood a while hesitating. 'it is not my will,' he said, 'to put aside my sword or to deliver and√∫ril to the hand of any other man.'
'it is the will of th

keen and clear, 'that way lies our hope, where sits our greatest fear. doom hangs still on a thread. yet hope there is still, if we can but stand unconquered for a little while.'
the others too now turned their eyes eastward. over the sundering leagues of land, far away they gazed to the edge of sight, and hope and fear bore their thoughts still on, beyond dark mountains to the land of shadow. where now was the ring-bearer? how thin indeed was the thread upon which doom still hung! it seemed to legolas, as he strained his farseeing eyes, that he caught a glint of white: far away perchance the sun twinkled on a pinnacle of the tower of guard. and further still, endlessly remote and yet a present threat, there was a tiny tongue of flame.
slowly th√©oden sat down again, as if weariness still struggled to master him against the will of gandalf. he turned and looked at his great house. 'alas!' he said, 'that these evil days should be mine, and should come in my old age instead of that peace which

now men came bearing raiment of war from the king's hoard and they arrayed aragorn and legolas in shining mail. helms too they chose, and round shields: their bosses were overlaid with gold and set with gems, green and red and white. gandalf took no armour; and gimli needed no coat of rings, even if one had been found to match his stature, for there was no hauberk in the hoards of edoras of better make than his short corslet forged beneath the mountain in the north. but he chose a cap of iron and leather that fitted well upon his round head; and a small shield he also took. it bore the r

he spoke her eyes went to aragorn who stood nearby.
'the king shall come again,' he said. 'fear not! not west but east does our doom await us.'
the king now went down the stair with gandalf beside him. the others followed. aragorn looked back as they passed towards the gate. alone √©owyn stood before the doors of the house at the stair's head; the sword was set upright before her, and her hands were laid upon the hilt. she was clad now in mail and shone like silver in the sun.
gimli walked with legolas. his axe on his shoulder. 'well, at last we set off!' he said. 'men need many words before deeds. my axe is restless in my hands. though i doubt not that these rohirrim are fell-handed when they come to it. nonetheless this is not the warfare that suits me. how shall i come to the battle? i wish i could walk and not bump like a sack at gandalf's saddlebow.'
'a safer seat than many, i guess,' said legolas. 'yet doubtless gandalf will gladly put you down on your feet when blows begin; or shadowfa

'and a dwarf is no horseman. it is orc-necks i would hew, not shave the scalps of men,' said gimli, patting the haft of his axe.
at the gate they found a great host of men, old and young, all ready in the saddle. more than a thousand were there mustered. their spears were like a springing wood. loudly and joyously they shouted as th√©oden came forth. some held in readiness the king's horse, snowmane, and others held the horses of aragorn and legolas. gimli stood ill at ease, frowning, but √©omer came up to him, leading his horse.
'hail, gimli gl√≥in's son!' he cried. 'i have not had time to learn gentle speech under your rod, as you promised. but shall we not put aside our quarrel? at least i will speak no evil again of the lady of the wood.'
'i will forget my wrath for a while, √©omer son of √©omund,' said gimli; 'but if ever you chance to see the lady galadriel with your eyes, then you shall acknowledge her the fairest of ladies, or our

friendship will end.' 'so be it!' said √©omer. 'but until that time pardon me, and in token of pardon ride with me, i beg. gandalf will be at the head with the lord of the mark; but firefoot, my horse, will bear us both, if you will.'
'i thank you indeed,' said gimli greatly pleased. 'i will gladly go with you, if legolas, my comrade, may ride beside us.'
'it shall he so,' said √©omer. 'legolas upon my left, and aragorn upon my right, and none will dare to stand before us!'
'where is shadowfax?' said gandalf.
'running wild over the grass,' they answered. 'he will let no man handle him. there he goes, away down by the ford, like a shadow among the willows.'
gandalf whistled and called aloud the horse's name, and far away he tossed his head and neighed, and turning sped towards the host like an arrow.
'were the breath of the west wind to take a body visible, even so would it appear,' sa

nded, and within an hour they took the road again.
there were no clouds overhead yet, but a heaviness was in the air; it was hot for the season of the year. the rising sun was hazy, and behind it, following it slowly up the sky, there was a growing darkness, as of a great storm moving out of the east. and away in the north-west there seemed to be another darkness brooding about the feet of the misty mountains, a shadow that crept down slowly from the wizard's vale.
gandalf dropped back to where legolas rode beside √©omer. 'you have the keen eyes of your fair kindred, legolas,' he said; 'and they can tell a sparrow from a finch a league off. tell me, can you sec anything away yonder towards isengard?'
'many miles lie between,' said legolas, gazing thither and shading his eyes with his long hand. 'i can see a darkness. there are shapes moving in it, great shapes far away upon the bank of the river; but what they are i cannot tell. it is not mist or cloud that defeats my eyes: there is a veiling

 to stouthearted men, and i do not doubt that the main strength of the enemy is many times as great as all that we have here.'
'then let us be swift,' said √©omer. 'let us drive through such foes as are already between us and the fastness. there are caves in helm's deep where hundreds may lie hid; and secret ways lead thence up on to the hills.
'trust not to secret ways,' said the king. 'saruman has long spied out this land. still in that place our defence may last long. let us go!'
aragorn and legolas went now with √©omer in the van. on through the dark night they rode, ever slower as the darkness deepened and their way climbed southward, higher and higher into the dim folds about the mountains' feet. they found few of the enemy before them. here and there they came upon roving bands of orcs; but they fled ere the riders could take or slay them.
'it will not be long i fear,' said √©omer, 'ere the coming of the king's host will be known to the leader of our enemies, saruman or whatever captai

uld look. here and there were clefts in the stone through which men could shoot. this battlement could be reached by a stair running down from a door in the outer court of the hornburg; three flights of steps led also up on to the wall from the deep behind; but in front it was smooth, and the great stones of it were set with such skill that no foothold could be found at their joints, and at the top they hung over like a sea-delved cliff.
gimli stood leaning against the breastwork upon the wall. legolas sat above on the parapet, fingering his bow, and peering out into the gloom.
'this is more to my liking,' said the dwarf, stamping on the stones. 'ever my heart rises as we draw near the mountains. there is good rock here. this country has tough bones. i felt them in my feet as we came up from the dike. give me a year and a hundred of my kin and i would make this a place that armies would break upon like water.'

'i followed you to shake off sleep,' said gimli; 'but i looked on the hillmen and they seemed over large for me, so i sat beside a stone to see your sword-play.'
'i shall not find it easy to repay you,' said √©omer.
'there may be many a chance ere the night is over,' laughed the dwarf. 'but i am content. till now i have hewn naught but wood since i left moria.'
'two!' said gimli, patting his axe. he had returned to his place on the wall.
'two?' said legolas. 'i have done better, though now i must grope for spent arrows; all mine are gone. yet i make my tale twenty at the least. but that is only a few leaves in a forest.'
the sky now was quickly clearing and the sinking moon was shining brightly. but the light brought little hope to the riders of the mark. the enemy before them seemed to have grown rather than diminished, still more were pressing up from the valley through the breach. the sortie upon the rock gained only a brief respite. the assaul

gh which the stream flowed out. there they had gathered in the shadow of the cliffs, until the assault above was hottest and nearly all the men of the defence had rushed to the wall's top. then they sprang out. already some had passed into the jaws of the deep and were among the horses, fighting with the guards.
down from the wall leapt gimli with a fierce cry that echoed in the cliffs. 'khaz√¢d! khaz√¢d!' he soon had work enough.
'ai-oi!' he shouted. 'the orcs are behind the wall. ai-oi! come, legolas! there are enough for us both. khaz√¢d ai-m√™nu!'
gamling the old looked down from the hornburg, hearing the great voice of the dwarf above all the tumult. 'the orcs are in the deep!' he cried. 'helm! helm! forth helmingas. he shouted as he leaped down the stair from the rock with many men of westfold at his back.
their onset was fierce and sudden, and the orcs gave way before them. ere long they were hemmed in in the narrows of the gorge, and all were slain or driven shrieking into the chasm o

'twenty-one!' cried gimli. he hewed a two-handed stroke and laid the last orc before his feet. 'now my count passes master legolas again.'
'we must stop this rat-hole,' said gamling. 'dwarves are said to be cunning folk with stone. lend us your aid, master!'
'we do not shape stone with battle-axes, nor with our finger-nails,' said gimli. 'but i will help as i may.'
they gathered such small boulders and broken stones as they could find to hand, and under gimli's direction the westfold-men blocked up the inner end of the culvert, until only a narrow outlet remained. then the deeping-stream, swollen by the rain, churned and f

retted in its choked path, and spread slowly in cold pools from cliff to cliff.
'it will be drier above,' said gimli. 'come, gamling, let us see how things go on the wall!'
he climbed up and found legolas beside aragorn and √©omer. the elf was whetting his long knife. there was for a while a lull in the assault, since the attempt to break in through the culvert had been foiled.
'twenty-one!' said gimli.
'good!' said legolas. 'but my count is now two dozen. it has been knife-work up here.'
√©omer and aragorn leant wearily on their swords. away on the left the crash and clamour of the battle on the rock rose loud again. but the hornburg still held fast, like an island in the sea. its gates lay in ruin; but over the barricade of beams and stones within no enemy as yet had passed.
aragorn looked at the pale stars, and at the moon, now sloping behind the western hills that enclosed the valley. 'this is a night as long

riders were driven back, further and further into the deep, falling and fighting as they gave way, step by step, towards the caves. others cut their way back towards the citadel.
a broad stairway, climbed from the deep up to the rock and the rear-gate of the hornburg. near the bottom stood aragorn. in his hand still and√∫ril gleamed, and the terror of the sword for a while held back the enemy, as one by one all who could gain the stair passed up towards the gate. behind on the upper steps knelt legolas. his bow was bent, but one gleaned arrow was all that he had left, and he peered out now, ready to shoot the first orc that should dare to approach the stair.
'all who can have now got safe within, aragorn,' he called. 'come back!'
aragorn turned and sped up the stair; but as he ran he stumbled in his weariness. at once his enemies leapt forward. up came the orcs, yelling, with their long arms stretched out to seize him. the foremost fell with legolas' last arrow in his throat. but the rest spr

ang over him. then a great boulder, cast from the outer wall above, crashed down upon the stair, and hurled them back into the deep. aragorn gained the door, and swiftly it clanged to behind him.
'things go ill, my friends,' he said, wiping the sweat from his brow with his arm.
'ill enough,' said legolas, 'but not yet hopeless, while we have you with us. where is gimli?'
'i do not know.' said aragorn. 'i last saw him fighting on the ground behind the wall, but the enemy swept us apart.'
'alas! that is evil news,' said legolas.
'he is stout and strong,' said aragorn. 'let us hope that he will escape back to the caves. there he would be safe for a while. safer than we. such a refuge would be to the liking of a dwarf.'
'that must be my hope'' said legolas. 'but i wish that he had come this way. i

desired to tell master gimli that my tale is now thirty-nine.'
'if he wins back to the caves, he will pass your count again,' laughed aragorn. 'never did i see an axe so wielded.'
'i must go and seek some arrows,' said legolas. 'would that this night would end, and i could have better light for shooting.'
aragorn now passed into the citadel. there to his dismay he learned that √©omer had not reached the hornburg.
'nay, he did not come to the rock,' said one of the westfold-men, 'i last saw him gathering men about him and fighting in the mouth of the deep. gamling was with him, and the dwarf; but i could not come to them.'
aragorn strode on through the inner court, and mounted to a high chamber in the tower. there sto

'i will ride with you,' said aragorn.
taking his leave, he returned to the walls, and passed round all their circuit, enheartening the men, and lending aid wherever the assault was hot. legolas went with him. blasts of fire leaped up from below shaking the stones. grappling-hooks were hurled, and ladders raised. again and again the orcs gained the summit of the outer wall, and again the defenders cast them down.
at last aragorn stood above the great gates, heedless of the darts of the enemy. as he looked forth he saw the eastern sky grow pale. then he raised his empty hand, palm outward in token of parley.
the orcs yelled and jeered. 'come down! come down!' they cried. 'if you wish to

er, clad in white, shining in the rising sun. over the low hills the horns were sounding. behind him, hastening down the long slopes, were a thousand men on foot; their swords were in their hands. amid them strode a man tall and strong. his shield was red. as he came to the valley's brink, he set to his lips a great black horn and blew a ringing blast.
'erkenbrand!' the riders shouted. 'erkenbrand!'
'behold the white rider!' cried aragorn. 'gandalf is come again!'
'mithrandir, mithrandir!' said legolas. 'this is wizardry indeed! come! i would look on this forest, ere the spell changes.'
the hosts of isengard roared, swaying this way and that, turning from fear to fear. again the horn sounded from the tower. down through the breach of the dike charged the king's company. down from the hills leaped erkenbrand, lord of westfold. down leaped shadowfax, like a deer that runs surefooted in the mountains. the white rider was upon them, and the terror of his coming filled the enemy with madness. the

wild men fell on their faces before him. the orcs reeled and screamed and cast aside both sword and spear. like a black smoke driven by a mounting wind they fled. wailing they passed under the waiting shadow of the trees; and from that shadow none ever came again.

chapter 8

the road to isengard

so it was that in the light of a fair morning king th√©oden and gandalf the white rider met again upon the green grass beside the deeping-stream. there was also aragorn son of arathorn, and legolas the elf, and erkenbrand of westfold, and the lords of the golden house. about them were gathered the rohirrim, the riders of the mark: wonder overcame their joy in victory, and their eyes were turned towards the wood.
suddenly there was a great shout, and down from the dike came those who had been driven back into the deep. there came gamling the old, and √©omer son of √©omund, and beside them walked gimli the dwarf. he had no helm, and about his head was a linen band stained with blood; but hi

'forty-two, master legolas!' he cried. 'alas! my axe is notched: the forty-second had an iron collar on his neck. how is it with you?'
'you have passed my score by one,' answered legolas. 'but i do not grudge you the game, so glad am i to see you on your legs!'
'welcome, √©omer, sister-son!' said th√©oden. 'now that i see you safe, i am glad indeed.'
'hail, lord of the mark!' said √©omer. 'the dark night has passed and day has come again. but the day has brought strange tidings.' he turned and gazed in wonder, first at the wood and then at gandalf. 'once more you come in the hour of need, unlooked-for,' he said.
'unlooked-for?' said gandalf. 'i said that i would return and meet

o a parley not to a fight.'
the king then chose men that were unhurt and had swift horses, and he sent them forth with tidings of the victory into every vale of the mark; and they bore his summons also, bidding all men, young and old, to come in haste to edoras. there the lord of the mark would hold an assembly of all that could bear arms, on the second day after the full moon. to ride with him to isengard the king chose √©omer and twenty men of his household. with gandalf would go aragorn, and legolas, and gimli. in spite of his hurt the dwarf would not stay behind.
'it was only a feeble blow and the cap turned it;' he said. 'it would take more than such an orc-scratch to keep me back.'
'i will tend it, while you rest,' said aragorn.
the king now returned to the hornburg, and slept, such a sleep of quiet as he had not known for many years, and the remainder of his chosen company rested also. but the others, all that were not hurt or wounded, began a great labour; for many had fallen in the b

 boughs; and through it gandalf passed, and they followed him. then to their amazement they found that the road ran on, and the deeping-stream beside it; and the sky was open above and full of golden light. but on either side the great aisles of the wood were already wrapped in dusk, stretching away into impenetrable shadows; and there they heard the creaking and groaning of boughs, and far cries, and a rumour of wordless voices, murmuring angrily. no orc or other living creature could be seen.
legolas and gimli were now riding together upon one horse; and they kept close beside gandalf, for gimli was afraid of the wood.
'it is hot in here,' said legolas to gandalf. 'i feel a great wrath about me. do you not feel the air throb in your ears?'
'yes,' said gandalf.
'what has become of the miserable orcs?' said legolas.
'that, i think, no one will ever know,' said gandalf.
they rode in silence for a while; but legolas was ever glancing from side to side, and would often have halted to listen to t

he sounds of the wood, if gimli had allowed it.
'these are the strangest trees that ever i saw,' he said; 'and i have seen many an oak grow from acorn to ruinous age. i wish that there were leisure now to walk among them: they have voices, and in time i might come to understand their thought.'
'no, no!' said gimli. 'let us leave them! i guess their thought already: hatred of all that go on two legs; and their speech is of crushing and strangling.'
'not of all that go on two legs,' said legolas. 'there i think you are wrong. it is orcs that they hate. for they do not belong here and know little of elves and men. far away are the valleys where they sprang. from the deep dales of fangorn, gimli, that is whence they come, i guess.'
'then that is the most perilous wood in middle-earth,' said gimli. 'i should be grateful for the part they have played, but i do not love them. you may think them wonderful, but i have seen a greater wonder in this land, more beautiful than any grove or glade

'strange are the ways of men, legolas! here they have one of the marvels of the northern world, and what do they say of it? caves, they say! caves! holes to fly to in time of war, to store fodder in! my good legolas, do you know that the caverns of helm's deep are vast and beautiful? there would be an endless pilgrimage of dwarves, merely to gaze at them, if such things were known to be. aye indeed, they would pay pure gold for a brief glance!'
'and i would give gold to be excused,' said legolas; 'and double to be let out, if i strayed in!'

 dark pools covered with clear glass; cities. such as the mind of durin could scarce have imagined in his sleep, stretch on through avenues and pillared courts, on into the dark recesses where no light can come. and plink! a silver drop falls, and the round wrinkles in the glass make all the towers bend and waver like weeds and corals in a grotto of the sea. then evening comes: they fade and twinkle out; the torches pass on into another chamber and another dream. there is chamber after chamber, legolas; hall opening out of hall, dome after dome, stair beyond stair; and still the winding paths lead on into the mountains' heart. caves! the caverns of helm's deep! happy was the chance that drove me there! it makes me weep to leave them.'
'then i will wish you this fortune for your comfort, gimli,' said the elf, 'that you may come safe from war and return to see them again. but do not tell all your kindred! there seems little left for them to do, from your account. maybe the men of this land are

hose caves for stones or ore, not if diamonds and gold could be got there. do you cut down groves of blossoming trees in the spring-time for firewood? we would tend these glades of flowering stone, not quarry them. with cautious skill, tap by tap - a small chip of rock and no more, perhaps, in a whole anxious day - so we could work, and as the years went by, we should open up new ways, and display far chambers that are still dark, glimpsed only as a void beyond fissures in the rock. and lights, legolas! we should make lights, such lamps as once shone in khazad-d√ªm; and when we wished we would drive away the night that has lain there since the hills were made; and when we desired rest, we would let the night return.'
'you move me, gimli,' said legolas. 'i have never heard you speak like this before. almost you make me regret that i have not seen these caves. come! let us make this bargain-if we both return safe out of the perils that await us, we will journey for a while together. you shall v

isit fangorn with me, and then i will come with you to see helm's deep.'
'that would not be the way of return that i should choose,' said gimli. 'but i will endure fangorn, if i have your promise to come back to the caves and share their wonder with me.'
'you have my promise,' said legolas. 'but alas! now we must leave behind both cave and wood for a while: see! we are coming to the end of the trees. how far is it to isengard, gandalf?'
'about fifteen leagues, as the crows of saruman make it.' said gandalf: 'five from the mouth of deeping-coomb to the fords: and ten more from there to the gates of isengard. but we shall not ride all the way this night.'
'and when we come there, what shall we see?' asked gimli. 'you may know, but i cannot guess.'
'i do not know myself for certain,

' answered the wizard. 'i was there at nightfall yesterday, but much may have happened since. yet i think that you will not say that the journey was in vain - not though the glittering caves of aglarond be left behind.'
at last the company passed through the trees, and found that they had come to the bottom of the coomb, where the road from helm's deep branched, going one way east to edoras, and the other north to the fords of isen. as they rode from under the eaves of the wood, legolas halted and looked back with regret. then he gave a sudden cry.
'there are eyes!' he said. 'eyes looking out from the shadows of the boughs! i never saw such eyes before.'
the others, surprised by his cry, halted and turned; but legolas started to ride back.
'no, no!' cried gimli. 'do as you please in your madness, but let me first get down from this horse! i wish to see no eyes!' 'stay, legolas greenleaf!' said gandalf. 'do not go back into the wood, not yet! now is not your time.'

'yet also i should be sad,' said th√©oden. 'for however the fortune of war shall go, may it not so end that much that was fair and wonderful shall pass for ever out of middle-earth?'
'it may,' said gandalf. 'the evil of sauron cannot be wholly cured, nor made as if it had not been. but to such days we are doomed. let us now go on with the journey we have begun!'
the company turned then away from the coomb and from the wood and took the road towards the fords. legolas followed reluctantly. the sun had set, already it had sunk behind the rim of the world; but as they rode out from the shadow of the hills and looked west to the gap of rohan the sky was still red, and a burning light was under the floating clouds. dark against it there wheeled and flew many black-winged birds. some passed overhead with mournful cries, returning to their homes among the rocks.
'the carrion-fowl have been busy about the battle-field,' said √©omer.

oubtless he would!' laughed gandalf. 'and was it saruman that ordered you to guard his damaged doors, and watch for the arrival of guests, when your attention could be spared from plate and bottle?'
'no, good sir, the matter escaped him,' answered merry gravely 'he has been much occupied. our orders came from treebeard, who has taken over the management of isengard. he commanded me to welcome the lord of rohan with fitting words. i have done my best.'
'and what about your companions? what about legolas and me?' cried gimli, unable to contain himself longer. 'you rascals, you woolly-footed and wool-pated truants! a fine hunt you have led us! two hundred leagues, through fen and forest, battle and death, to rescue you! and here we find you feasting and idling-and smoking! smoking! where did you come by the weed, you villains? hammer and tongs! i am so torn between rage and joy, that if i do not burst. it will be a marvel!'

ming lake; and as they looked, they heard a distant rumbling and rattling, as if an avalanche was falling from the mountain-side. far away came a hoom-hom, as of horns blowing triumphantly.
'and is orthanc then left unguarded?' asked gandalf.
'there is the water,' said merry. 'but quickbeam and some others are watching it. not all those posts and pillars in the plain are of saruman's planting. quickbeam, i think, is by the rock, near the foot of the stair.'
'yes, a tall grey ent is there,' said legolas, 'but his arms are at his sides, and he stands as still as a door-tree.'
'it is past noon,' said gandalf, 'and we at any rate have not eaten since early morning. yet i wish to see treebeard as soon as may be. did he leave me no message, or has plate and bottle driven it from your mind?'
'he left a message,' said merry, 'and i was coming to it, but i have been hindered by many other questions. i was to say that, if the lord of the mark and gandalf will ride to the northern wall they will find tr

the hobbits bowed low. 'so that is the king of rohan!' said pippin in an undertone. 'a fine old fellow. very polite.'

chapter 9

flotsam and jetsam

gandalf and the king's company rode away, turning eastward to make the circuit of the ruined walls of isengard. but aragorn, gimli, and legolas remained behind. leaving arod and hasufel to stray in search of grass, they came and sat beside the hobbits.
'well, well! the hunt is over, and we meet again at last, where none of us ever thought to come,' said aragorn.
'and now that the great ones have gone to discuss high matters,' said legolas, 'the hunters can perhaps learn the answers to their own small riddles. we tracked you as far as the forest, but there are still many things that i should like to know the truth of.'
'and there is a g

reat deal, too, that we want to know about you ' said merry. 'we have learnt a few things through treebeard, the old ent, but that is not nearly enough.'
'all in good time,' said legolas. 'we were the hunters, and you should give an account of yourselves to us first.'
'or second,' said gimli. 'it would go better after a meal. t have a sore head; and it is past mid-day. you truants might make amends by finding us some of the plunder that you spoke of. food and drink would pay off some of my score against you.'
'then you shall have it,' said pippin. 'will you have it here, or in more comfort in what's left of saruman's guard-house--over there under the arch? we had to picnic out

'indeed yes,' said gimli. 'the score is much reduced.'
the three were soon busy with their meal; and the two hobbits, unabashed, set to a second time. 'we must keep our guests company,' they said.
'you are full of courtesy this morning,' laughed legolas. 'but maybe. if we had not arrived, you would already have been keeping one another company again.'
'maybe; and why not?' said pippin. 'we had foul fare with the orcs, and little enough for days before that. it seems a long while since we could eat to heart's content.'
'it does not seem to have done you any harm,' said aragorn. 'indeed you look in the bloom of health.'
'aye, you do indeed,' said gimli, looking them up and down over the top of his cup. 'why, your hair is twice as thick and curly

 as when we parted; and i would swear that you have both grown somewhat, if that is possible for hobbits of your age. this treebeard at any rate has not starved you.'
'he has not,' said merry. 'but ents only drink, and drink is not enough for content. treebeard's draughts may be nourishing, but one feels the need of something solid. and even lembas is none the worse for a change.'
'you have drunk of the waters of the ents, have you?' said legolas. 'ah, then i think it is likely that gimli's eyes do not deceive him. strange songs have been sung of the draughts of fangorn.'
'many strange tales have been told about that land,' said aragorn. 'i have never entered it. come, tell me more about it, and about the ents!'
'ents,' said pippin, 'ents are - well ents are all different for on thing. but their eyes now, their eyes are very odd.' he tried a few fumbling words that trailed off into silence. 'oh, well,' he went on, 'you have seen some at

re's another: an unused one. i have carried it a long way,, though i don't know why. i never really expected to find any pipe-weed on the journey, when my own ran out. but now it comes in useful after all.' he held up a small pipe with a wide flattened bowl, and handed it to gimli. 'does that settle the score between us?' he said. 'settle it!' cried gimli. 'most noble hobbit, it leaves me deep in your debt.'
'well, i am going back into the open air, to see what the wind and sky are doing!' said legolas.
'we will come with you,' said aragorn.
they went out and seated themselves upon the piled stones before the gateway. they could see far down into the valley now; the mists were lifting and floating away upon the breeze.
'now let us take our ease here for a little!' said aragorn. 'we will sit on the edge of ruin and talk, as gandalf says, while he is busy elsewhere. i feel a weariness such as i have seldom felt before.' he wrapped his grey cloak about him, hiding his mail-shirt, and stretched o

ut his long legs. then he lay back and sent from his lips a thin stream of smoke.
'look!' said pippin. 'strider the ranger has come back!'
'he has never been away,' said aragorn. 'i am strider and d√∫nadan too, and i belong both to gondor and the north.'
they smoked in silence for a while, and the sun shone on them; slanting into the valley from among white clouds high in the west. legolas lay still, looking up at the sun and sky with steady eyes, and singing softly to himself. at last he sat up. 'come now!' he said. 'time wears on, and the mists are blowing away, or would if you strange folk did not wreathe yourselves in smoke. what of the tale?'
'well, my tale begins with waking up in the dark and finding myself all strung-up in an orc-camp,' said pippin. 'let me see, what is today?'
'the fifth of march in the shire-reckoning,' said aragorn. pippin made some calculations on his

'and here also is your brooch, pippin,' said aragorn. 'i have kept it safe, for it is a very precious thing.'
'i know,' said pippin. 'it was a wrench to let it go; but what else could i do?'
'nothing else,' answered aragorn. 'one who cannot cast away a treasure at need is in fetters. you did rightly.'
'the cutting of the bands on your wrists, that was smart work!' said gimli. 'luck served you there; but you seized your chance with both hands, one might say.'
'and set us a pretty riddle,' said legolas. 'i wondered if you had grown wings!'
'unfortunately not,' said pippin. 'but you did not know about grishn√°kh.' he shuddered and said no more, leaving merry to tell of those last horrible moments: the pawing hands, the hot breath, and the dreadful strength of grishn√°kh's hairy arms.
'all this about the orcs of barad-d√ªr, lugb√∫rz as they call it, makes me uneasy,' said aragorn. 'the dark lord already knew too much and his servants also; and grishn√°kh evidently sent some message across the r

blackened holes, and dotted with posts and pillars leaning drunkenly this way and that. at the rim of the shattered bowl there lay vast mounds and slopes, like the shingles cast up by a great storm; and beyond them the green and tangled valley ran up into the long ravine between the dark arms of the mountains. across the waste they saw riders picking their way; they were coming from the north side, and already they were drawing near to orthanc.
'there is gandalf, and th√©oden and his men!' said legolas. 'let us go and meet them!'
'walk warily!' said merry. 'there are loose slabs that may tilt up and throw you down into a pit, if you don't take care.'
they followed what was left of the road from the gates to orthanc, going slowly, for the flag-stones were cracked and slimed. the riders, seeing them approach, halted under the shadow of the rock and waited for them. gandalf rode forward to meet them.
'well, treebeard and i have had some interesting discussions, and made a few plans,' he said; 'a

king dismounted. 'i will go up,' said gandalf. 'i have been in orthanc and i know my peril.'
'and i too will go up,' said the king. 'i am old, and fear no peril any more. i wish to speak with the enemy who has done me so much wrong. √©omer shall come with me, and see that my aged feet do not falter.'
'as you will,' said gandalf. 'aragorn shall come with me. let the others await us at the foot of the stairs. they will hear and see enough, if there is anything to hear or see.'
'nay!' said gimli. 'legolas and i wish for a closer view. we alone here represent our kindred. we also will come behind.'
'come then!' said gandalf, and with that he climbed the steps, and th√©oden went beside him.
the riders of rohan sat uneasily upon their horses, on either side of the stair, and looked up darkly at the great tower, fearing what might befall their lord. merry and pippin sat on the bottom step, feeling both unimportant and unsafe.
'half a sticky mile from here to the gate!' muttered pippin. 'i wish i cou

a shrill shriek; suddenly cut off, came from an open window high above.
'it seems that saruman thinks so too,' said gandalf. 'let us leave them!'
they returned now to the ruins of the gate. hardly had they passed out under the arch, when, from among the shadows of the piled stones where they had stood, treebeard and a dozen other ents came striding up. aragorn, gimli and legolas gazed at them in wonder.
'here are three of my companions, treebeard,' said gandalf. 'i have spoken of them, but you have not yet seen them.' he named them one by one.
the old ent looked at them long and searchingly, and spoke to them in turn. last he turned to legolas. 'so you have come all the way from mirkwood, my good elf? a very great forest it used to be!'
'and still is,' said legolas. 'but not so great that we who dwell there ever tire of seeing new trees. i should dearly love to journey

 in fangorn's wood. i scarcely passed beyond the eaves of it, and i did not wish to turn back.'
treebeard's eyes gleamed with pleasure. 'i hope you may have your wish, ere the hills be much older,' he said.
'i will come, if i have the fortune,' said legolas. 'i have made a bargain with my friend that, if all goes well, we will visit fangorn together - by your leave.'
'any elf that comes with you will be welcome,' said treebeard.
'the friend i speak of is not an elf,' said legolas; 'i mean gimli, gl√≥in's son here.' gimli bowed low, and the axe slipped from his belt and clattered on the ground.
'hoom, hm! ah now,' said treebeard, looking dark-eyed at him. 'a dwarf and an axe-bearer! hoom! i have good will to elves; but you ask much. this is a strange friendship!' 'strange it may seem,' said legolas; 'but while gimli lives i shall not come to fangorn alone. his axe is not for trees, but for orc-necks, o fangorn, master of fangorn's wood. forty-two he hewed in the battle.'
