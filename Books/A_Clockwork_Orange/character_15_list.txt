Dad - 
                Played by
Philip Stone
                Alex's father, also well intentioned
but weak. Toward the beginning of the film Dad seems as though he
might stand up to Alex and ask him how he spends his evenings and
whether he is getting into trouble, but then he fails to confront
him. When Alex returns from prison, Dad is the one who tells him
he can't move back home. Instead of taking responsibility for this
decision, he falls back on the excuse that he and Mum have made
a contract with their new lodger and couldn't possibly break it.
At the end of the film, he comes to Alex full of sorrow and contrition
for the way he treated him.
