Aporia - 
                
                    Aporia is
the Greek term for the state of helplessness--the inability to proceed--that
ends all of Plato's early dialogues. Through his pointed questioning,
Socrates succeeds in showing that his interlocutors have no appropriate
definition for the topic under consideration (be that topic piety,
love, courage, justice, or whatever else), but nor is he able to
supply one himself. In Book I of The Republic Socrates
brings his friends to a state of aporia on the topic of justice, but
then in the next nine books he manages to move beyond the aporia
and give an actual answer to the question at hand.
