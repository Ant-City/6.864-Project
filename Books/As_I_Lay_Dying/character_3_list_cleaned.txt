[CHARACTER] - 
                	the
bastard child of addie and whitfield, the minister. though darl
seems to understand him, [CHARACTER] remains the novel's greatest mystery,
and is the least represented in its many sections. [CHARACTER] has a proud,
fiercely independent nature that most of his family and neighbors
confuse for selfishness. his passionate, brooding nature, however,
reveals a real love and dedication to his mother, and he becomes
a fierce protector of her coffin.
