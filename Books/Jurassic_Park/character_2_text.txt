of digging. i told him i'd do what i could."
"so you agreed to prepare a paper for him."
"yes."
"on the dietary habits of juvenile dinosaurs?"
"yes."
"you met gennaro?"
"no. just on the phone."
"did gennaro say why he wanted this information?"
"yes," grant said. "he was planning a museum for children, and he wanted to feature baby
dinosaurs. he said he was hiring a number of academic consultants, and named them. there
were paleontologists like me, and a mathematician from texas named ian malcolm, and a couple
of ecologists. a systems analyst. good group."
morris nodded, making notes. "so you accepted the consultancy?"
"yes. i agreed to send him a summary of our work: what we knew about the habits of the
duckbilled hadrosaurs we'd found."
"what kind of information did you send?" morris asked.
"everything: nesting behavior, territorial ranges, feeding behavior, social behavior. everything."
"and how did gennaro respond?"
"he kept calling and calling. sometimes in the middle of the night.

ld-man's voice speaking rapidly: "-
hell of an annoyance from some epa fellow, seems to have gone off half cocked, all on his own,
running around the country talking to people, stirring up things. i don't suppose anybody's come
to see you way out there?"
"as a matter of fact," grant said, "somebody did come to see me."
hammond snorted. "i was afraid of that. smart-ass kid named morris?"
"yes, his name was morris," grant said.
"he's going to see all our consultants," hammond said. "he went to see ian malcolm the other
day-you know, the mathematician in texas? that's the first i knew of it. we're having one hell of a
time getting a handle on this thing, it's typical of the way government operates, there isn't any
complaint, there isn't any charge, just harassment from some kid who's unsupervised and is
running around at the taxpayers' expense. did he bother you? disrupt your work?" 
"no, no, he didn't bother me."
"well, that's too bad, in a way," hammond said, "because i'd try and get an injunction

e plane at the dallas airport, a tall, thin, balding man of
thirty-five, dressed entirely in black: black shirt, black trousers, black socks, black sneakers.
"ah, dr. malcolm," hammond said, smiling with forced graciousness.
malcolm grinned. "hello, john. yes, i am afraid your old nemesis is here."
malcolm shook bands with everyone, saying quickly, "ian malcolm, how do you do? i do
maths." he struck grant as being more amused by the outing than anything else.
certainly grant recognized his name. ian malcolm was one of the most famous of the new
generation of mathematicians who were openly interested in "how the real world works." these
scholars broke with the cloistered tradition of mathematics in several important ways. for one
thing, they used computers constantly, a practice traditional mathematicians frowned on. for
another, they worked almost exclusively with nonlinear equations, in the emerging field called
chaos theory. for a third, they appeared to care that their mathematics described som

alcolm shrugged, indifferent to hammond's outburst. "i've brought copies of my original
paper for you to took at," he said. "the original consultancy paper i did for ingen. the
mathematics are a bit sticky, but i can walk you through it. are you leaving now?"
"i have some phone calls to make," hammond said, and went into the adjoining cabin.
"well, it's a long flight," malcolm said to the others. "at least my paper will give you something
to do."
the plane flew through the night.
grant knew that ian malcolm had his share of detractors, and he could understand why some
found his style too abrasive, and his applications of chaos theory too glib. grant thumbed through
the paper, glancing at the equations.
gennaro said, "your paper concludes that hammond's island is bound to fail?"
"correct."
"because of chaos theory?"
"correct. to be more precise, because of the behavior of the system in phase space."
gennaro tossed the paper aside and said, "can you explain this in english?"
"surely," malcolm said.

'll worry about it later," he said. "right now let's just get that tree off the fence."
arnold was in an expansive mood. the park was almost back in order. muldoon was repairing the
fences. hammond had gone off to supervise the transfer of the animals with harding. although
he was tired, arnold was feeling good; he was even in a mood to indulge the lawyer, gennaro.
"the malcolm effect?" arnold said. "you worried about that?"
"i'm just curious," gennaro said.
"you mean you want me to tell you why ian malcolm is wrong?"
"sure."
arnold lit another cigarette. "it's technical."
"try me."
"okay," arnold said. "chaos theory describes nonlinear systems. it's now become a very broad
theory that's been used to study everything from the stock market, to rioting crowds, to brain
waves during epilepsy. a very fashionable theory. very trendy to apply it to any complex system
where there might be unpredictability. okay?"
"okay," gennaro said.
"ian malcolm is a mathematician specializing in chaos theory. quite am

their departure. but the plain fact was that many people had died in a territorial possession of
costa rica. the plain fact was that an ecological disaster had been narrowly averted. the
government of costa rica felt it had been misled and deceived by john hammond and his plans
for the island. under the circumstances, the government was not disposed to release survivors in a
hurry. they did not even permit the burial of hammond or ian malcolm. they simply waited.
each day it seemed to grant he was taken to another government office, where he was
questioned by another courteous, intelligent government officer. they made him go over his
story, again and again. how grant had met john hammond. what grant knew of the project.
how grant had received the fax from new york. why grant had gone to the island. what had
happened at the island.

certain ideas presented here about paleo-dna, the genetic material of extinct animals, were
first articulated by george o. poinar, jr., and roberta hess, who formed the extinct dna study
group at berkeley. some discussions of chaos theory derive in part from the commentaries of
ivar ekeland and james gleick. the computer programs of bob gross inspired some of the
graphics. the work of the late heinz pagels provoked ian malcolm.
however, this book is entirely fiction, and the views expressed here are my own, as are
whatever factual errors exist in the text.
