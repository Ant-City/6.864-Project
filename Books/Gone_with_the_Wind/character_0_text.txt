scarlett o'hara was not beautiful, but men seldom realized it when
caught by her charm as the tarleton twins were.  in her face were
too sharply blended the delicate features of her mother, a coast
aristocrat of french descent, and the heavy ones of her florid
irish father.  but it was an arresting face, pointed of chin,
square of jaw.  her eyes were pale green without a touch of hazel,
starred with bristly black lashes and slightly tilted at the ends.
above them, her thick black brows slanted upward, cutting

rate.
and stuart might have made the match, but brent had not been
satisfied.  brent liked india but he thought her mighty plain and
tame, and he simply could not fall in love with her himself to
keep stuart company.  that was the first time the twins' interest
had ever diverged, and brent was resentful of his brother's
attentions to a girl who seemed to him not at all remarkable.

then, last summer at a political speaking in a grove of oak trees
at jonesboro, they both suddenly became aware of scarlett o'hara.
they had known her for years, and, since their childhood, she had
been a favorite playmate, for she could ride horses and climb
trees almost as well as they.  but now to their amazement she had
become a grown-up young lady and quite the most charming one in
all the world.

they noticed for the first time how her green eyes danced, how
deep her dimples were when she laughed, how tiny her hands and
feet and what a small waist she had.  their clever remarks sent
her into merry peals of laughter a

 darlin', listen to me!  i'll leave tara
to you and cade--"

"i wouldn't have cade on a silver tray," cried scarlett in fury.
"and i wish you'd quit pushing him at me!  i don't want tara or
any old plantation.  plantations don't amount to anything when--"

she was going to say "when you haven't the man you want," but
gerald, incensed by the cavalier way in which she treated his
proffered gift, the thing which, next to ellen, he loved best in
the whole world uttered a roar.

"do you stand there, scarlett o'hara, and tell me that tara--that
land--doesn't amount to anything?"

scarlett nodded obstinately.  her heart was too sore to care
whether or not she put her father in a temper.

"land is the only thing in the world that amounts to anything," he
shouted, his thick, short arms making wide gestures of indignation,
"for 'tis the only thing in this world that lasts, and don't you be
forgetting it!  'tis the only thing worth working for, worth
fighting for--worth dying for."

"oh, pa," she said disgusted

 at times, he had an ungallant feeling that
honey's coquetries and proprietary airs were no credit to him, for
she was so boy-crazy he imagined she would use them on any man who
gave her the opportunity.  charles was not excited over the
prospect of marrying her, for she stirred in him none of the
emotions of wild romance that his beloved books had assured him
were proper for a lover.  he had always yearned to be loved by
some beautiful, dashing creature full of fire and mischief.

and here was scarlett o'hara teasing him about breaking her heart!

he tried to think of something to say and couldn't, and silently
he blessed her because she kept up a steady chatter which relieved
him of any necessity for conversation.  it was too good to be
true.

"now, you wait right here till i come back, for i want to eat
barbecue with you.  and don't you go off philandering with those
other girls, because i'm mighty jealous," came the incredible
words from red lips with a dimple on each side; and briskly black

 were red with indignation.  but
suddenly the home guard gave a cheer and it was taken up by the
other uniformed guests.  the young girls clapped their hands and
jumped excitedly.

"don't you think it's--it's just--just a little like a slave
auction?" whispered melanie, staring uncertainly at the embattled
doctor who heretofore had been perfect in her eyes.

scarlett said nothing but her eyes glittered and her heart
contracted with a little pain.  if only she were not a widow.  if
only she were scarlett o'hara again, out there on the floor in an
apple-green dress with dark-green velvet ribbons dangling from her
bosom and tuberoses in her black hair--she'd lead that reel.  yes,
indeed!  there'd be a dozen men battling for her and paying over
money to the doctor.  oh, to have to sit here, a wallflower
against her will and see fanny or maybelle lead the first reel as
the belle of atlanta!

above the tumult sounded the voice of the little zouave, his
creole accent very obvious:  "eef i may--twenty dollar

and they fell in love.
oh, it was heaven after the last dreary year!

scarlett was back again where she had been before she married
charles and it was as if she had never married him, never felt the
shock of his death, never borne wade.  war and marriage and
childbirth had passed over her without touching any deep chord
within her and she was unchanged.  she had a child but he was
cared for so well by the others in the red brick house she could
almost forget him.  in her mind and heart, she was scarlett o'hara
again, the belle of the county.  her thoughts and activities were
the same as they had been in the old days, but the field of her
activities had widened immensely.  careless of the disapproval of
aunt pitty's friends, she behaved as she had behaved before her
marriage, went to parties, danced, went riding with soldiers,
flirted, did everything she had done as a girl, except stop
wearing mourning.  this she knew would be a straw that would break
the backs of pittypat and melanie.  she was as cha

dually, scarlett drew courage from the brave faces of her
friends and from the merciful adjustment which nature makes when
what cannot be cured must be endured.  to be sure, she still jumped
at the sound of explosions but she did not run screaming to burrow
her head under melanie's pillow.  she could now gulp and say
weakly:  "that was close, wasn't it?"

she was less frightened also because life had taken on the quality
of a dream, a dream too terrible to be real.  it wasn't possible
that she, scarlett o'hara, should be in such a predicament, with
the danger of death about her every hour, every minute.  it wasn't
possible that the quiet tenor of life could have changed so
completely in so short a time.

it was unreal, grotesquely unreal, that morning skies which dawned
so tenderly blue could be profaned with cannon smoke that hung over
the town like low thunder clouds, that warm noontides filled with
the piercing sweetness of massed honeysuckle and climbing roses
could be so fearful, as shells screa

ching legs.  she had a
faint memory of melanie's voice before sleep clamped down her
eyelids, a weak voice that apologized even as it begged:  "scarlett,
can i have some water, please?"

she had said:  "there isn't any," and gone to sleep before the
words were out of her mouth.

now it was morning and the world was still and serene and green and
gold with dappled sunshine.  and no soldiers in sight anywhere.
she was hungry and dry with thirst, aching and cramped and filled
with wonder that she, scarlett o'hara, who could never rest well
except between linen sheets and on the softest of feather beds, had
slept like a field hand on hard planks.

blinking in the sunlight, her eyes fell on melanie and she gasped,
horrified.  melanie lay so still and white scarlett thought she
must be dead.  she looked dead.  she looked like a dead, old woman
with her ravaged face and her dark hair snarled and tangled across
it.  then scarlett saw with relief the faint rise and fall of her
shallow breathing and knew that

er with childlike faith, clinging to her skirts,
knowing that ellen's daughter would be the refuge ellen had always
been.

through the window, in the faint light of the rising moon, tara
stretched before her, negroes gone, acres desolate, barns ruined,
like a body bleeding under her eyes, like her own body, slowly
bleeding.  this was the end of the road, quivering old age,
sickness, hungry mouths, helpless hands plucking at her skirts.
and at the end of this road, there was nothing--nothing but
scarlett o'hara hamilton, nineteen years old, a widow with a little
child.

what would she do with all of this?  aunt pitty and the burrs in
macon could take melanie and her baby.  if the girls recovered,
ellen's family would have to take them, whether they liked it or
not.  and she and gerald could turn to uncle james and andrew.

she looked at the thin forms, tossing before her, the sheets about
them moist and dark from dripping water.  she did not like suellen.
she saw it now with a sudden clarity.  she had

 three short mounds of her little brothers.  oh, ellen--
she trudged on down the dusty hill, passing the heap of ashes
and the stumpy chimney where the slattery house had stood, and she
wished savagely that the whole tribe of them had been part of the
ashes.  if it hadn't been for the slatterys--if it hadn't been for
that nasty emmie who'd had a bastard brat by their overseer--ellen
wouldn't have died.

she moaned as a sharp pebble cut into her blistered foot.  what was
she doing here?  why was scarlett o'hara, the belle of the county,
the sheltered pride of tara, tramping down this rough road almost
barefoot?  her little feet were made to dance, not to limp, her
tiny slippers to peep daringly from under bright silks, not to
collect sharp pebbles and dust.  she was born to be pampered and
waited upon, and here she was, sick and ragged, driven by hunger to
hunt for food in the gardens of her neighbors.

at the bottom of the long hill was the river and how cool and still
were the tangled trees overhang

in her eyes.  no sooner had the lump gone down than her empty
outraged stomach revolted and she lay in the soft dirt and vomited
tiredly.

the faint niggery smell which crept from the cabin increased her
nausea and, without strength to combat it, she kept on retching
miserably while the cabins and trees revolved swiftly around her.

after a long time, she lay weakly on her face, the earth as soft
and comfortable as a feather pillow, and her mind wandered feebly
here and there.  she, scarlett o'hara was lying behind a negro
cabin, in the midst of ruins, too sick and too weak to move, and no
one in the world knew or cared.  no one would care if they did
know, for everyone had too many troubles of his own to worry about
her.  and all this was happening to her, scarlett o'hara, who had
never raised her hand even to pick up her discarded stockings from
the floor or to tie the laces of her slippers--scarlett, whose
little headaches and tempers had been coddled and catered to all
her life.

could glimpse a corner of the old secretary.  there was the dining
room, with chairs pushed awry and food still on the plates.  there
on the floor were the rag rugs ellen had dyed and woven herself.
and there was the old portrait of grandma robillard, with bosoms
half bared, hair piled high and nostrils cut so deeply as to give
her face a perpetual well-bred sneer.  everything which had been
part of her earliest memories, everything bound up with the deepest
roots in her:  "good-by!  good-by, scarlett o'hara!"

the yankees would burn it all--all!

this was her last view of home, her last view except what she might
see from the cover of the woods or the swamp, the tall chimneys
wrapped in smoke, the roof crashing in flame.

"i can't leave you," she thought and her teeth chattered with fear.
"i can't leave you.  pa wouldn't leave you.  he told them they'd
have to burn you over his head.  then, they'll burn you over my
head for i can't leave you either.  you're all i've got left."

she walked to the long pier glass and looked at herself, her head
held high.  and she saw framed in the cracking gilt molding a
stranger.  it was as if she were really seeing herself for the
first time in a year.  she had glanced in the mirror every morning
to see that her face was clean and her hair tidy but she had always
been too pressed by other things to really see herself.  but this
stranger!  surely this thin hollow-cheeked woman couldn't be
scarlett o'hara!  scarlett o'hara had a pretty, coquettish, high-
spirited face.  this face at which she stared was not pretty at all
and had none of the charm she remembered so well.  it was white and
strained and the black brows above slanting green eyes swooped up
startlingly against the white skin like frightened bird's wings.
there was a hard and hunted look about this face.

"i'm not pretty enough to get him!" she thought and desperation
came back to her.  "i'm thin--oh, i'm terribly thin!"

whatever obstacles there might be, fought on with a determination
that would not recognize defeat, and kept on fighting even when she
saw defeat was inevitable.

but, for four years, he had seen others who had refused to
recognize defeat, men who rode gaily into sure disaster because
they were gallant.  and they had been defeated, just the same.

he thought as he stared at will in the shadowy hall that he had
never known such gallantry as the gallantry of scarlett o'hara
going forth to conquer the world in her mother's velvet curtains
and the tail feathers of a rooster.



chapter xxxiii


a cold wind was blowing stiffly and the scudding clouds overhead
were the deep gray of slate when scarlett and mammy stepped from
the train in atlanta the next afternoon.  the depot had not been
rebuilt since the burning of the city and they alighted amid
cinders and mud a few yards above the blackened ruins which marked
the site.  habit strong upon her, scarlett looked about

n on her face.  she knew that the feeling of
triumph surging through her was certain to be plain in her eyes.
in a moment he would ask her to marry him--or at least say that he
loved her and then . . .  as she watched him through the veil of
her lashes he turned her hand over, palm up, to kiss it too, and
suddenly he drew a quick breath.  looking down she saw her own
palm, saw it as it really was for the first time in a year, and a
cold sinking fear gripped her.  this was a stranger's palm, not
scarlett o'hara's soft, white, dimpled, helpless one.  this hand
was rough from work, brown with sunburn, splotched with freckles.
the nails were broken and irregular, there were heavy calluses on
the cushions of the palm, a half-healed blister on the thumb.  the
red scar which boiling fat had left last month was ugly and
glaring.  she looked at it in horror and, before she thought, she
swiftly clenched her fist.

still he did not raise his head.  still she could not see his face.

gotten the money for her if he'd wanted to get it.  oh, hanging was
too good for him!  thank god, he couldn't see her now, with her
clothes soaking wet and her hair straggling and her teeth
chattering.  how hideous she must look and how he would laugh!

the negroes she passed turned insolent grins at her and laughed
among themselves as she hurried by, slipping and sliding in the
mud, stopping, panting to replace her slippers.  how dared they
laugh, the black apes!  how dared they grin at her, scarlett o'hara
of tara!  she'd like to have them all whipped until the blood ran
down their backs.  what devils the yankees were to set them free,
free to jeer at white people!

as she walked down washington street, the landscape was as dreary
as her own heart.  here there was none of the bustle and
cheerfulness which she had noted on peachtree street.  here many
handsome homes had once stood, but few of them had been rebuilt.

anxiety and burst into tears.  it was easy to cry, because she was
so cold and miserable, but the effect was startling.  frank could
not have been more embarrassed or helpless if she had suddenly
begun disrobing.  he clicked his tongue against his teeth several
times, muttering "my! my!" and made futile gestures at her.  a
daring thought went through his mind that he should draw her head
onto his shoulder and pat her but he had never done this to any
woman and hardly knew how to go about it.  scarlett o'hara, so high
spirited and pretty, crying here in his buggy.  scarlett o'hara,
the proudest of the proud, trying to sell needlework to the
yankees.  his heart burned.

she sobbed on, saying a few words now and then, and he gathered
that all was not well at tara.  mr. o'hara was still "not himself
at all," and there wasn't enough food to go around for so many.  so
she had to come to atlanta to try to make a little money for
herself and her boy.  frank clicked his tongue again and suddenly
he found th

so ashley was mixed up in this frightening puzzle.  scarlett went
cold, her hand at her throat.  did the yankees have ashley now?
why, why didn't frank ask what it was all about?  why did he take
it all so coolly, so much as a matter of course?  she struggled to
get the question to her lips.

"what--" she began.  "who--"

"your father's old overseer--that damned--jonas wilkerson."

"did you--is he dead?"

"my god, scarlett o'hara!" said tony peevishly.  "when i start out
to cut somebody up, you don't think i'd be satisfied with
scratching him with the blunt side of my knife, do you?  no, by
god, i cut him to ribbons."

"good," said frank casually.  "i never liked the fellow."

scarlett looked at him.  this was not the meek frank she knew, the
nervous beard clawer who she had learned could be bullied with such
ease.  there was an air about him that was crisp and cool and he
was meeting the emergency with no unnecessary w

we do?" she thought, wringing her hands in an agony of
helpless fear.  "what can we do with devils who'd hang a nice boy
like tony just for killing a drunken buck and a scoundrelly
scallawag to protect his women folks?"

"it isn't to be borne!" tony had cried and he was right.  it
couldn't be borne.  but what could they do except bear it, helpless
as they were?  she fell to trembling and, for the first time in her
life, she saw people and events as something apart from herself,
saw clearly that scarlett o'hara, frightened and helpless, was not
all that mattered.  there were thousands of women like her, all
over the south, who were frightened and helpless.  and thousands of
men, who had laid down their arms at appomattox, had taken them up
again and stood ready to risk their necks on a minute's notice to
protect those women.

there had been something in tony's face which had been mirrored in
frank's, an expression she had seen recently on the faces of other
men in atlanta, a look she had noticed but h

"india!" said melanie warningly, her hands clenching on her sewing.

"i think i know my husband better than you do," said scarlett, the
prospect of a quarrel, the first open quarrel she had ever had with
india, making her spirits rise and her nervousness depart.
melanie's eyes caught india's and reluctantly india closed her
lips.  but almost instantly she spoke again and her voice was cold
with hate.

"you make me sick, scarlett o'hara, talking about being protected!
you don't care about being protected!  if you did you'd never have
exposed yourself as you have done all these months, prissing
yourself about this town, showing yourself off to strange men,
hoping they'll admire you!  what happened to you this afternoon was
just what you deserved and if there was any justice you'd have
gotten worse."

"oh, india, hush!" cried melanie.

"let her talk," cried scarlett.  "i'm enjoying it.  i always knew

 had never claimed them, would
never claim them.  somewhere deep in her was the desire to keep
herself for him, although she knew he would never take her.

she did not know that her face had changed, that reverie had
brought a softness to her face which rhett had never seen before.
he looked at the slanting green eyes, wide and misty, and the
tender curve of her lips and for a moment his breath stopped.  then
his mouth went down violently at one corner and he swore with
passionate impatience.

"scarlett o'hara, you're a fool!"

before she could withdraw her mind from its far places, his arms
were around her, as sure and hard as on the dark road to tara, so
long ago.  she felt again the rush of helplessness, the sinking
yielding, the surging tide of warmth that left her limp.  and the
quiet face of ashley wilkes was blurred and drowned to nothingness.
he bent back her head across his arm and kissed her, softly at
first, and then with a swift gradation of intensity that made her
cling to him as the onl
