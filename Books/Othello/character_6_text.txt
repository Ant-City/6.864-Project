aemil. but iealious soules will not be answer'd so;
they are not euer iealious for the cause,
but iealious, for they're iealious. it is a monster
begot vpon it selfe, borne on it selfe

   des. heauen keepe the monster from othello's mind.

  cassio. what make you from home?
how is't with you, my most faire bianca?
indeed (sweet loue) i was comming to your house

   bian. and i was going to your lodging, cassio.
what? keepe a weeke away? seuen dayes, and nights?
eight score eight houres? and louers absent howres
more tedious then the diall, eight score times?
oh weary reck'ning

   cassio. pardon me, bianca:

but i shall in a mor

strike off this score of absence. sweet bianca
take me this worke out

   bianca. oh cassio, whence came this?
this is some token from a newer friend,
to the felt-absence: now i feele a cause:
is't come to this? well, well

   cassio. go too, woman:
throw your vilde gesses in the diuels teeth,
from whence you haue them. you are iealious now,
that this is from some mistris, some remembrance;
no, in good troth bianca

   bian. why, who's is it?
  cassio. i know not neither:
i found it in my chamber,
i like the worke well; ere it be demanded
(as like enough it will) i would haue it coppied:
take it, and doo't, and leaue me for this time

   bian. leaue you? wherefore?
  cassio. i do attend heere on the generall,
and thinke it no addition, nor my wish
to haue him see me woman'd

   bian. why, i pray you?

for i will make him tell the tale anew;
where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when
he hath, and is againe to cope your wife.
i say, but marke his gesture: marry patience,
or i shall say y'are all in all in spleene,
and nothing of a man

   iago. that's not amisse,
but yet keepe time in all: will you withdraw?
now will i question cassio of bianca,
a huswife that by selling her desires
buyes her selfe bread, and cloath. it is a creature
that dotes on cassio, (as 'tis the strumpets plague
to be-guile many, and be be-guil'd by one)
he, when he heares of her, cannot restraine
from the excesse of laughter. heere he comes.
enter cassio.

as he shall smile, othello shall go mad:
and his vnbookish ielousie must conserue
poore cassio's smiles, gestures, and light behauiours
quite in the wrong. how do you lieutenant?
