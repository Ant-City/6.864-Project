hen his enemies spoke of him, they saidâ€”but, after all, he had no enemies; he was an extremely amiable fellow, and universally liked. what i should say is, simply, that when certain persons spoke of him they affirmed that the reason of his spending so much time at geneva was that he was extremely devoted to a lady who lived thereâ€”a foreign ladyâ€”a person older than himself. very few americansâ€”indeed, i think noneâ€”had ever seen this lady, about whom there were some singular stories. but winterbourne had an old attachment for the little metropolis of calvinism; he had been put to school there as a boy, and he had afterward gone to college thereâ€”circumstances which had led to his forming a great many youthful friendships. many of these he had kept, and they were a source of great satisfaction to him.
after knocking at his auntâ€™s door and learning that she was indisposed, he had taken a walk about the town, and then he had come in to his breakfast. he had now finished his breakfast; but h

athâ€”an urchin of nine or ten. the child, who was diminutive for his years, had an aged expression of countenance, a pale complexion, and sharp little features. he was dressed in knickerbockers, with red stockings, which displayed his poor little spindle-shanks; he also wore a brilliant red cravat. he carried in his hand a long alpenstock, the sharp point of which he thrust into everything that he approachedâ€”the flowerbeds, the garden benches, the trains of the ladiesâ€™ dresses. in front of winterbourne he paused, looking at him with a pair of bright, penetrating little eyes.
â€œwill you give me a lump of sugar?â€ he asked in a sharp, hard little voiceâ€”a voice immature and yet, somehow, not young.
winterbourne glanced at the small table near him, on which his coffee service rested, and saw that several morsels of sugar remained. â€œyes, you may take one,â€ he answered; â€œbut i donâ€™t think sugar is good for little boys.â€
this little boy stepped forward and carefully selected three of t

he coveted fragments, two of which he buried in the pocket of his knickerbockers, depositing the other as promptly in another place. he poked his alpenstock, lance-fashion, into winterbourneâ€™s bench and tried to crack the lump of sugar with his teeth.
â€œoh, blazes; itâ€™s har-r-d!â€ he exclaimed, pronouncing the adjective in a peculiar manner.
winterbourne had immediately perceived that he might have the honor of claiming him as a fellow countryman. â€œtake care you donâ€™t hurt your teeth,â€ he said, paternally.
â€œi havenâ€™t got any teeth to hurt. they have all come out. i have only got seven teeth. my mother counted them last night, and one came out right afterward. she said sheâ€™d slap me if any more came out. i canâ€™t help it. itâ€™s this old europe. itâ€™s the climate that makes them come out. in america they didnâ€™t come out. itâ€™s t

winterbourne was much amused. â€œif you eat three lumps of sugar, your mother will certainly slap you,â€ he said.
â€œsheâ€™s got to give me some candy, then,â€ rejoined his young interlocutor. â€œi canâ€™t get any candy hereâ€”any american candy. american candyâ€™s the best candy.â€
â€œand are american little boys the best little boys?â€ asked winterbourne.
â€œi donâ€™t know. iâ€™m an american boy,â€ said the child.
â€œi see you are one of the best!â€ laughed winterbourne.
â€œare you an american man?â€ pursued this vivacious infant. and then, on winterbourneâ€™s affirmative replyâ€”â€œamerican men are the best,â€ he declared.
his companion thanked him for the compliment, and the child, who had now got astride of his alpenstock, stood looking about him, while he attacked a second lump of sugar. winterbourne wondered if he himself had been like this in his infancy, for he had been brought to europe at about this age.
â€œhere comes my sister!â€ cried the child i

n a moment. â€œsheâ€™s an american girl.â€
winterbourne looked along the path and saw a beautiful young lady advancing. â€œamerican girls are the best girls,â€ he said cheerfully to his young companion.
â€œmy sister ainâ€™t the best!â€ the child declared. â€œsheâ€™s always blowing at me.â€
â€œi imagine that is your fault, not hers,â€ said winterbourne. the young lady meanwhile had drawn near. she was dressed in white muslin, with a hundred frills and flounces, and knots of pale-colored ribbon. she was bareheaded, but she balanced in her hand a large parasol, with a deep border of embroidery; and she was strikingly, admirably pretty. â€œhow pretty they are!â€ thought winterbourne, straightening himself in his seat, as if he were prepared to rise.
the young lady paused in front of his bench, near the parapet of the garden, which overlooked th

e lake. the little boy had now converted his alpenstock into a vaulting pole, by the aid of which he was springing about in the gravel and kicking it up not a little.
â€œrandolph,â€ said the young lady, â€œwhat are you doing?â€
â€œiâ€™m going up the alps,â€ replied randolph. â€œthis is the way!â€ and he gave another little jump, scattering the pebbles about winterbourneâ€™s ears.
â€œthatâ€™s the way they come down,â€ said winterbourne.
â€œheâ€™s an american man!â€ cried randolph, in his little hard voice.
the young lady gave no heed to this announcement, but looked straight at her brother. â€œwell, i guess you had better be quiet,â€ she simply observed.
it seemed to winterbourne that he had been in a manner presented. he got up and stepped slowly toward the young girl, throwing away his cigarette. â€œthis little boy and i have made acquaintance,â€ he said, with great civility. in geneva, as he had been perfectly aware, a

young man was not at liberty to speak to a young unmarried lady except under certain rarely occurring conditions; but here at vevey, what conditions could be better than these?â€”a pretty american girl coming and standing in front of you in a garden. this pretty american girl, however, on hearing winterbourneâ€™s observation, simply glanced at him; she then turned her head and looked over the parapet, at the lake and the opposite mountains. he wondered whether he had gone too far, but he decided that he must advance farther, rather than retreat. while he was thinking of something else to say, the young lady turned to the little boy again.
â€œi should like to know where you got that pole,â€ she said.
â€œi bought it,â€ responded randolph.
â€œyou donâ€™t mean to say youâ€™re going to take it to italy

?â€
â€œyes, i am going to take it to italy,â€ the child declared.
the young girl glanced over the front of her dress and smoothed out a knot or two of ribbon. then she rested her eyes upon the prospect again. â€œwell, i guess you had better leave it somewhere,â€ she said after a moment.
â€œare you going to italy?â€ winterbourne inquired in a tone of great respect.
the young lady glanced at him again. â€œyes, sir,â€ she replied. and she said nothing more.
â€œare youâ€”aâ€”going over the simplon?â€ winterbourne pursued, a little embarrassed.
â€œi donâ€™t know,â€ she said. â€œi suppose itâ€™s some mountain. randolph, what mountain are we going over?â€
â€œgoing where?â€ the child demanded.
â€œto italy,â€ winterbourne explained.
â€œi donâ€™t know,â€ said randolph. â€œi donâ€™t want to go to italy. i want to go to am

â€œoh, italy is a beautiful place!â€ rejoined the young man.
â€œcan you get candy there?â€ randolph loudly inquired.
â€œi hope not,â€ said his sister. â€œi guess you have had enough candy, and mother thinks so too.â€
â€œi havenâ€™t had any for ever so longâ€”for a hundred weeks!â€ cried the boy, still jumping about.
the young lady inspected her flounces and smoothed her ribbons again; and winterbourne presently risked an observation upon the beauty of the view. he was ceasing to be embarrassed, for he had begun to perceive that she was not in the least embarrassed herself. there had not been the slightest alteration in her charming complexion; she was evidently neither offended nor flattered. if she looked another way when he spoke to her, and seemed not particularly to hear him, this was simply her habit, her manner. yet, as he talked a little more and pointed out some of the objects of int

erest in the view, with which she appeared quite unacquainted, she gradually gave him more of the benefit of her glance; and then he saw that this glance was perfectly direct and unshrinking. it was not, however, what would have been called an immodest glance, for the young girlâ€™s eyes were singularly honest and fresh. they were wonderfully pretty eyes; and, indeed, winterbourne had not seen for a long time anything prettier than his fair countrywomanâ€™s various featuresâ€”her complexion, her nose, her ears, her teeth. he had a great relish for feminine beauty; he was addicted to observing and analyzing it; and as regards this young ladyâ€™s face he made several observations. it was not at all insipid, but it was not exactly expressive; and though it was eminently delicate, winterbourne mentally accused itâ€”very forgivinglyâ€”of a want of finish. he thought it very p

er was a coquette; he was sure she had a spirit of her own; but in her bright, sweet, superficial little visage there was no mockery, no irony. before long it became obvious that she was much disposed toward conversation. she told him that they were going to rome for the winterâ€”she and her mother and randolph. she asked him if he was a â€œreal americanâ€; she shouldnâ€™t have taken him for one; he seemed more like a germanâ€”this was said after a little hesitationâ€”especially when he spoke. winterbourne, laughing, answered that he had met germans who spoke like americans, but that he had not, so far as he remembered, met an american who spoke like a german. then he asked her if she should not be more comfortable in sitting upon the bench which he had just quitted. she answered that she liked standing up and walking about; but she presently sat down. she told him she was from new york stateâ€”â€œif you know where that is.â€ winterbourne learned more about her by catching hold of her small, sli

â€œtell me your name, my boy,â€ he said.
â€œrandolph c. miller,â€ said the boy sharply. â€œand iâ€™ll tell you her name;â€ and he leveled his alpenstock at his sister.
â€œyou had better wait till you are asked!â€ said this young lady calmly.
â€œi should like very much to know your name,â€ said winterbourne.
â€œher name is daisy miller!â€ cried the child. â€œbut that isnâ€™t her real name; that isnâ€™t her name on her cards.â€
â€œitâ€™s a pity you havenâ€™t got one of my cards!â€ said miss miller.
â€œher real name is annie p. miller,â€ the boy went on.
â€œask him his name,â€ said his sister, indicating winterbourne.
but on this point randolph seemed perfectly indifferent; he continued to supply information with regard to his own family. â€œmy fatherâ€™s name is ezra b. miller,â€ he announced

. â€œmy father ainâ€™t in europe; my fatherâ€™s in a better place than europe.â€
winterbourne imagined for a moment that this was the manner in which the child had been taught to intimate that mr. miller had been removed to the sphere of celestial reward. but randolph immediately added, â€œmy fatherâ€™s in schenectady. heâ€™s got a big business. my fatherâ€™s rich, you bet!â€
â€œwell!â€ ejaculated miss miller, lowering her parasol and looking at the embroidered border. winterbourne presently released the child, who departed, dragging his alpenstock along the path. â€œhe doesnâ€™t like europe,â€ said the young girl. â€œhe wants to go back.â€
â€œto schenectady, you mean?â€
â€œyes; he wants to go right home. he hasnâ€™t got any boys here. there is one boy here, but he always goes round with a teacher; they wonâ€™t let him play.â€
â€œand your brother hasnâ€™t any teacher?â€ winterbourne inquired.
â€œmother thought of getting him one, to travel round with us. there was a

und with us. but randolph said he didnâ€™t want a teacher traveling round with us. he said he wouldnâ€™t have lessons when he was in the cars. and we are in the cars about half the time. there was an english lady we met in the carsâ€”i think her name was miss featherstone; perhaps you know her. she wanted to know why i didnâ€™t give randolph lessonsâ€”give him â€˜instruction,â€™ she called it. i guess he could give me more instruction than i could give him. heâ€™s very smart.â€
â€œyes,â€ said winterbourne; â€œhe seems very smart.â€
â€œmotherâ€™s going to get a teacher for him as soon as we get to italy. can you get good teachers in italy?â€
â€œvery good, i should think,â€ said winterbourne.
â€œor else sheâ€™s going to find some school. he ought to learn some more. heâ€™s only nine. heâ€™s going to college.â€ and in this way miss miller continued to converse upon the affairs of her family and upon other topics. she sat there with her extremely pretty hands, ornamented with very brilliant ring

t humor with everything. she declared that the hotels were very good, when once you got used to their ways, and that europe was perfectly sweet. she was not disappointedâ€”not a bit. perhaps it was because she had heard so much about it before. she had ever so many intimate friends that had been there ever so many times. and then she had had ever so many dresses and things from paris. whenever she put on a paris dress she felt as if she were in europe.
â€œit was a kind of a wishing cap,â€ said winterbourne.
â€œyes,â€ said miss miller without examining this analogy; â€œit always made me wish i was here. but i neednâ€™t have done that for dresses. i am sure they send all the pretty ones to america; you see the most frightful things here. the only thing i donâ€™t like,â€ she proceeded, â€œis the society. there isnâ€™t any society; or, if there is, i donâ€™t know where it keeps itself. do you? i suppose there is some society somewhere, but i havenâ€™t seen anything of it. iâ€™m very fond of society

, and i have always had a great deal of it. i donâ€™t mean only in schenectady, but in new york. i used to go to new york every winter. in new york i had lots of society. last winter i had seventeen dinners given me; and three of them were by gentlemen,â€ added daisy miller. â€œi have more friends in new york than in schenectadyâ€”more gentleman friends; and more young lady friends too,â€ she resumed in a moment. she paused again for an instant; she was looking at winterbourne with all her prettiness in her lively eyes and in her light, slightly monotonous smile. â€œi have always had,â€ she said, â€œa great deal of gentlemenâ€™s society.â€
poor winterbourne was amused, perplexed, and decidedly charmed. he had never yet heard a young girl express herself in just this fashion; never, at least, save in cases where to say such things seemed a kind of demonstrative evidence of a certain laxity of deportment. and yet was he to accuse miss daisy miller of actual or potent

so long that he had lost a good deal; he had become dishabituated to the american tone. never, indeed, since he had grown old enough to appreciate things, had he encountered a young american girl of so pronounced a type as this. certainly she was very charming, but how deucedly sociable! was she simply a pretty girl from new york state? were they all like that, the pretty girls who had a good deal of gentlemenâ€™s society? or was she also a designing, an audacious, an unscrupulous young person? winterbourne had lost his instinct in this matter, and his reason could not help him. miss daisy miller looked extremely innocent. some people had told him that, after all, american girls were exceedingly innocent; and others had told him that, after all, they were not. he was inclined to think miss daisy miller was a flirtâ€”a pretty american flirt. he had never, as yet, had any relations with young ladies of this category. he had known, here in europe, two or three womenâ€”persons older than miss daisy mi

ller, and provided, for respectabilityâ€™s sake, with husbandsâ€”who were great coquettesâ€”dangerous, terrible women, with whom oneâ€™s relations were liable to take a serious turn. but this young girl was not a coquette in that sense; she was very unsophisticated; she was only a pretty american flirt. winterbourne was almost grateful for having found the formula that applied to miss daisy miller. he leaned back in his seat; he remarked to himself that she had the most charming nose he had ever seen; he wondered what were the regular conditions and limitations of oneâ€™s intercourse with a pretty american flirt. it presently became apparent that he was on the way to learn.
â€œhave you been to that old castle?â€ asked the young girl, pointing with her parasol to the far-gleaming walls of the chateau de ch

â€œyes, formerly, more than once,â€ said winterbourne. â€œyou too, i suppose, have seen it?â€
â€œno; we havenâ€™t been there. i want to go there dreadfully. of course i mean to go there. i wouldnâ€™t go away from here without having seen that old castle.â€
â€œitâ€™s a very pretty excursion,â€ said winterbourne, â€œand very easy to make. you can drive, you know, or you can go by the little steamer.â€
â€œyou can go in the cars,â€ said miss miller.
â€œyes; you can go in the cars,â€ winterbourne assented.
â€œour courier says they take you right up to the castle,â€ the young girl continued. â€œwe were going last week, but my mother gave out. she suffers dreadfully from dyspepsia. she said she couldnâ€™t go. randolph wouldnâ€™t go either; he says he doesnâ€™t think much of old castles. but i guess weâ€™ll go this week, if we can get randolph.â€
â€œyour brother is not interested in ancient monuments?â€ winterbourne inquired, smiling.
â€œhe says he donâ€™t care much about old castles. h

eâ€™s only nine. he wants to stay at the hotel. motherâ€™s afraid to leave him alone, and the courier wonâ€™t stay with him; so we havenâ€™t been to many places. but it will be too bad if we donâ€™t go up there.â€ and miss miller pointed again at the chateau de chillon.
â€œi should think it might be arranged,â€ said winterbourne. â€œcouldnâ€™t you get some one to stay for the afternoon with randolph?â€
miss miller looked at him a moment, and then, very placidly, â€œi wish you would stay with him!â€ she said.
winterbourne hesitated a moment. â€œi should much rather go to chillon with you.â€
â€œwith me?â€ asked the young girl with the same placidity.
she didnâ€™t rise, blushing, as a young girl at geneva would have done; and yet winterbourne, conscious that he had been very bold, thought it possible she was offended.
 
 ___________________________
 
 â€œwith your mother,â€ he answered very respectfully.
but it seemed that both his audacity and his respect were lost upon miss daisy miller. â€œi guess my mother wonâ€™t go, after all,â€ she said. â€œshe donâ€™t like to ride round in the afternoon. but did you really mean what you said just nowâ€”that you would like to go up there?â€
â€œmost earnestly,â€ winterbourne declared.
â€œthen we may arrange it. if mother will stay with randolph, i guess eugenio will.â€
â€œeugenio?â€ the young man inquired.
â€œeugenioâ€™s our courier. he doesnâ€™t like to stay with randolph; heâ€™s the most fastidious man i ever saw. but heâ€™s a splendid courier. i guess heâ€™ll stay at home with randolph if mother does, and then we can go to the castle.â€
winterbourne reflected for an instant as lucidly as possibleâ€”â€œweâ€ could only mean miss daisy miller and himself. this

program seemed almost too agreeable for credence; he felt as if he ought to kiss the young ladyâ€™s hand. possibly he would have done so and quite spoiled the project, but at this moment another person, presumably eugenio, appeared. a tall, handsome man, with superb whiskers, wearing a velvet morning coat and a brilliant watch chain, approached miss miller, looking sharply at her companion. â€œoh, eugenio!â€ said miss miller with the friendliest accent.
eugenio had looked at winterbourne from head to foot; he now bowed gravely to the young lady. â€œi have the honor to inform mademoiselle that luncheon is upon the table.â€
miss miller slowly rose. â€œsee here, eugenio!â€ she said; â€œiâ€™m going to that old castle, anyway.â€
â€œto the chateau de chillon, mademoiselle?â€ the courier inquired. â€œmademoiselle has made arrangements?â€ he added in a tone which struck winterbourne as very impertinent.
eugenioâ€™s tone apparently threw, even to miss millerâ€™s own apprehension, a

 slightly ironical light upon the young girlâ€™s situation. she turned to winterbourne, blushing a littleâ€”a very little. â€œyou wonâ€™t back out?â€ she said.
â€œi shall not be happy till we go!â€ he protested.
â€œand you are staying in this hotel?â€ she went on. â€œand you are really an american?â€
the courier stood looking at winterbourne offensively. the young man, at least, thought his manner of looking an offense to miss miller; it conveyed an imputation that she â€œpicked upâ€ acquaintances. â€œi shall have the honor of presenting to you a person who will tell you all about me,â€ he said, smiling and referring to his aunt.
â€œoh, well, weâ€™ll go some day,â€ said miss miller. and she gave him a smile and turned away. she put up her parasol and walked back to the inn beside eugenio. winterbourne stood looking after her; an

d not seen him for many years, and she was greatly pleased with him, manifesting her approbation by initiating him into many of the secrets of that social sway which, as she gave him to understand, she exerted in the american capital. she admitted that she was very exclusive; but, if he were acquainted with new york, he would see that one had to be. and her picture of the minutely hierarchical constitution of the society of that city, which she presented to him in many different lights, was, to winterbourneâ€™s imagination, almost oppressively striking.
he immediately perceived, from her tone, that miss daisy millerâ€™s place in the social scale was low. â€œi am afraid you donâ€™t approve of them,â€ he said.
â€œthey are very common,â€ mrs. costello declared. â€œthey are the sort of americans that one does oneâ€™s duty by notâ€”not accepting.â€
â€œah, you donâ€™t accept them?â€ said the young man.
â€œi canâ€™t, my dear frederick. i would if i could, but i canâ€™t.â€

retty,â€ said winterbourne in a moment.
â€œof course sheâ€™s pretty. but she is very common.â€
â€œi see what you mean, of course,â€ said winterbourne after another pause.
â€œshe has that charming look that they all have,â€ his aunt resumed. â€œi canâ€™t think where they pick it up; and she dresses in perfectionâ€”no, you donâ€™t know how well she dresses. i canâ€™t think where they get their taste.â€
â€œbut, my dear aunt, she is not, after all, a comanche savage.â€
â€œshe is a young lady,â€ said mrs. costello, â€œwho has an intimacy with her mammaâ€™s courier.â€
â€œan intimacy with the courier?â€ the young man demanded.
â€œoh, the moth

er is just as bad! they treat the courier like a familiar friendâ€”like a gentleman. i shouldnâ€™t wonder if he dines with them. very likely they have never seen a man with such good manners, such fine clothes, so like a gentleman. he probably corresponds to the young ladyâ€™s idea of a count. he sits with them in the garden in the evening. i think he smokes.â€
winterbourne listened with interest to these disclosures; they helped him to make up his mind about miss daisy. evidently she was rather wild. â€œwell,â€ he said, â€œi am not a courier, and yet she was very charming to me.â€
â€œyou had better have said at first,â€ said mrs. costello with dignity, â€œthat you had made her acquaintance.â€
â€œwe simply met in the garden, and we talked a bit.â€
â€œtout bonnement! and pray what did you say?â€

â€œi am much obliged to you.â€
â€œit was to guarantee my respectability,â€ said winterbourne.
â€œand pray who is to guarantee hers?â€
â€œah, you are cruel!â€ said the young man. â€œsheâ€™s a very nice young girl.â€
â€œyou donâ€™t say that as if you believed it,â€ mrs. costello observed.
â€œshe is completely uncultivated,â€ winterbourne went on. â€œbut she is wonderfully pretty, and, in short, she is very nice. to prove that i believe it, i am going to take her to the chateau de chillon.â€
â€œyou two are going off there together? i should say it proved just the contrary. how long had you known her, may i ask, when this interesting project was formed? you havenâ€™t been twenty-four hours in the house.â€
â€œi have known her half an hour!â€ said winterbourne, smiling.
â€œdear me!â€ cried mrs. costello. â€œwhat a dreadful girl

 paused again.
â€œthink what, sir?â€ said his aunt.
â€œthat she is the sort of young lady who expects a man, sooner or later, to carry her off?â€
â€œi havenâ€™t the least idea what such young ladies expect a man to do. but i really think that you had better not meddle with little american girls that are uncultivated, as you call them. you have lived too long out of the country. you will be sure to make some great mistake. you are too innocent.â€
â€œmy dear aunt, i am not so innocent,â€ said winterbourne, smiling and curling his mustache.
â€œyou are guilty too, then!â€
winterbourne continued to curl his mustache meditatively. â€œyou wonâ€™t let the poor girl know you then?â€ he asked at last.
â€œis it literally true that she is going to the chateau de chillon with you?â€
â€œi think that she fully intends it.â€
â€œthen, my dear frederick,â€ said mrs. costello, â€œi must decline the honor of her acquaintance. i am an old woman, but i am not too old, thank heaven, to be shocked!â€

â€™t they all do these thingsâ€”the young girls in america?â€ winterbourne inquired.
mrs. costello stared a moment. â€œi should like to see my granddaughters do them!â€ she declared grimly.
this seemed to throw some light upon the matter, for winterbourne remembered to have heard that his pretty cousins in new york were â€œtremendous flirts.â€ if, therefore, miss daisy miller exceeded the liberal margin allowed to these young ladies, it was probable that anything might be expected of her. winterbourne was impatient to see her again, and he was vexed with himself that, by instinct, he should not appreciate her justly.
though he was impatient to see her, he hardly knew what he should say to her about his auntâ€™s refusal to become acquainted with her; but he discovered, promptly enough, that with miss daisy miller there was no great need of walking on tiptoe. he found her that evening in the garden, wandering about in the warm starlight like an indolent sylph, and swinging to and fro the large

â€œhas she gone to bed?â€
â€œno; she doesnâ€™t like to go to bed,â€ said the young girl. â€œshe doesnâ€™t sleepâ€”not three hours. she says she doesnâ€™t know how she lives. sheâ€™s dreadfully nervous. i guess she sleeps more than she thinks. sheâ€™s gone somewhere after randolph; she wants to try to get him to go to bed. he doesnâ€™t like to go to bed.â€
â€œlet us hope she will persuade him,â€ observed winterbourne.
â€œshe will talk to him all she can; but he doesnâ€™t like her to talk to him,â€ said miss daisy, opening her fan. â€œsheâ€™s going to try to get eugenio to talk to him. but he isnâ€™t afraid of eugenio. eugenioâ€™s a splendid courier, but he canâ€™t make much impression on randolph! i donâ€™t believe heâ€™ll go to bed before eleven.â€ it appeared that randolphâ€™s vigil was in fact triumphantly prolonged, for winterbourne strolled about with the young girl for some time without meeting her

mother. â€œi have been looking round for that lady you want to introduce me to,â€ his companion resumed. â€œsheâ€™s your aunt.â€ then, on winterbourneâ€™s admitting the fact and expressing some curiosity as to how she had learned it, she said she had heard all about mrs. costello from the chambermaid. she was very quiet and very comme il faut; she wore white puffs; she spoke to no one, and she never dined at the table dâ€™hote. every two days she had a headache. â€œi think thatâ€™s a lovely description, headache and all!â€ said miss daisy, chattering along in her thin, gay voice. â€œi want to know her ever so much. i know just what your aunt

winterbourne was embarrassed. â€œshe would be most happy,â€ he said; â€œbut i am afraid those headaches will interfere.â€
the young girl looked at him through the dusk. â€œbut i suppose she doesnâ€™t have a headache every day,â€ she said sympathetically.
winterbourne was silent a moment. â€œshe tells me she does,â€ he answered at last, not knowing what to say.
miss daisy miller stopped and stood looking at him. her prettiness was still visible in the darkness; she was opening and closing her enormous fa

n. â€œshe doesnâ€™t want to know me!â€ she said suddenly. â€œwhy donâ€™t you say so? you neednâ€™t be afraid. iâ€™m not afraid!â€ and she gave a little laugh.
winterbourne fancied there was a tremor in her voice; he was touched, shocked, mortified by it. â€œmy dear young lady,â€ he protested, â€œshe knows no one. itâ€™s her wretched health.â€
the young girl walked on a few steps, laughing still. â€œyou neednâ€™t be afraid,â€ she repeated. â€œwhy should she want to know me?â€ then she paused again; she was close to the parapet of the garden, and in front of her was the starlit lake. there was a vague sheen upon its surface, and in the distance were dimly seen

mountain forms. daisy miller looked out upon the mysterious prospect and then she gave another little laugh. â€œgracious! she is exclusive!â€ she said. winterbourne wondered whether she was seriously wounded, and for a moment almost wished that her sense of injury might be such as to make it becoming in him to attempt to reassure and comfort her. he had a pleasant sense that she would be very approachable for consolatory purposes. he felt then, for the instant, quite ready to sacrifice his aunt, conversationally; to admit that she was a proud, rude woman, and to declare that they neednâ€™t mind her. but before he had time to commit himself to this perilous

 mixture of gallantry and impiety, the young lady, resuming her walk, gave an exclamation in quite another tone. â€œwell, hereâ€™s mother! i guess she hasnâ€™t got randolph to go to bed.â€ the figure of a lady appeared at a distance, very indistinct in the darkness, and advancing with a slow and wavering movement. suddenly it seemed to pause.
â€œare you sure it is your mother? can you distinguish her in this thick dusk?â€ winterbourne asked.
â€œwell!â€ cried miss daisy miller with a laugh; â€œi guess i know my own mother. and when she has got on my shawl, too! she is always wearing my things.â€
the lady in question, ceasing to advance, hovered vaguely about the spot at which she had checked her steps.
â€œi am afraid your mother doesnâ€™t see you,â€ said winterbourne. â€œor perhaps,â€ he added, thinking, with miss miller, the joke permissibleâ€”â€œperhaps she feels guilty about your shawl.â€
â€œoh, itâ€™s a fearful old t

â€œah, then,â€ said winterbourne, â€œi had better leave you.â€
â€œoh, no; come on!â€ urged miss daisy miller.
â€œiâ€™m afraid your mother doesnâ€™t approve of my walking with you.â€
miss miller gave him a serious glance. â€œit isnâ€™t for me; itâ€™s for youâ€”that is, itâ€™s for her. well, i donâ€™t know who itâ€™s for! but mother doesnâ€™t like any of my gentlemen friends. sheâ€™s right down timid. she always makes a fuss if i introduce a gentleman. but i do introduce themâ€”almost always. if i didnâ€™t introduce my gentle

â€œto introduce me,â€ said winterbourne, â€œyou must know my name.â€ and he proceeded to pronounce it.
â€œoh, dear, i canâ€™t say all that!â€ said his companion with a laugh. but by this time they had come up to mrs. miller, who, as they drew near, walked to the parapet of the garden and leaned upon it, looking intently at the lake and turning her back to them. â€œmother!â€ said the young girl in a tone of decision. upon this the elder lady turned round. â€œmr. winterbourne,â€ said miss daisy miller, introducing the young man ver

y frankly and prettily. â€œcommon,â€ she was, as mrs. costello had pronounced her; yet it was a wonder to winterbourne that, with her commonness, she had a singularly delicate grace.
her mother was a small, spare, light person, with a wandering eye, a very exiguous nose, and a large forehead, decorated with a certain amount of thin, much frizzled hair. like her daughter, mrs. miller was dressed with extreme elegance; she had enormous diamonds in her ears. so far as winterbourne could observe, she gave him no greetingâ€”she certainly was not looking at him. daisy was near her, pulling her shawl straight. â€œwhat are you doing, poking round here?â€ this young lady inquired, but by no means with that harshness of accent which her choice of words may imply.
â€œi donâ€™t know,â€ said her mother, turning toward the lake again.
â€œi shouldnâ€™t think youâ€™d want that shawl!â€ daisy exclaimed.
â€œwell i do!â€ her mother answered with a little laugh.
â€œdid you get randol

â€œno; i couldnâ€™t induce him,â€ said mrs. miller very gently. â€œhe wants to talk to the waiter. he likes to talk to that waiter.â€
â€œi was telling mr. winterbourne,â€ the young girl went on; and to the young manâ€™s ear her tone might have indicated that she had been uttering his name all her life.
â€œoh, yes!â€ said winterbourne; â€œi have the pleasure of knowing your son.â€
randolphâ€™s mamma was silent; she turned her attention to the lake. but at last she spoke. â€œwell, i donâ€™t see how he lives!â€
â€œanyhow, it isnâ€™t so bad as it was at dover,â€ said daisy miller.
â€œand what occurred at dover?â€ winterbourne asked.
â€œhe wouldnâ€™t go to bed at all. i guess he sat up all night in the public parlor. he wasnâ€™t in bed at twelve oâ€™clock: i know that.â€
â€œit was half-past twelve,â€ declared mrs. miller w

â€œdoes he sleep much during the day?â€ winterbourne demanded.
â€œi guess he doesnâ€™t sleep much,â€ daisy rejoined.
â€œi wish he would!â€ said her mother. â€œit seems as if he couldnâ€™t.â€
â€œi think heâ€™s real tiresome,â€ daisy pursued.
then, for some moments, there was silence. â€œwell, daisy miller,â€ said the elder lady, presently, â€œi shouldnâ€™t think youâ€™d want to talk against your own brother!â€
â€œwell, he is tiresome, mother,â€ said daisy, quite without the asperity of a retort.
â€œheâ€™s only nine,â€ urged mrs. miller.

œwell, he wouldnâ€™t go to that castle,â€ said the young girl. â€œiâ€™m going there with mr. winterbourne.â€
to this announcement, very placidly made, daisyâ€™s mamma offered no response. winterbourne took for granted that she deeply disapproved of the projected excursion; but he said to himself that she was a simple, easily managed person, and that a few deferential protestations would take the edge from her displeasure. â€œyes,â€ he began; â€œyour daughter has kindly allowed me the honor of being her guide.â€
mrs. millerâ€™s wandering eyes attached themselves, with a sort of appealing air, to daisy, who, however, strolled a few steps farther, gently humming to herself. â€œi presume you w

â€œyes, or in the boat,â€ said winterbourne.
â€œwell, of course, i donâ€™t know,â€ mrs. miller rejoined. â€œi have never been to that castle.â€
â€œit is a pity you shouldnâ€™t go,â€ said winterbourne, beginning to feel reassured as to her opposition. and yet he was quite prepared to find that, as a matter of course, she meant to accompany her daughter.
â€œweâ€™ve been thinking ever so much about going,â€ she pursued; â€œbut it seems as if we couldnâ€™t. of course daisyâ€”she wants to go round. but thereâ€™s a lady hereâ€”i donâ€™t know her nameâ€”she says she shouldnâ€™t think weâ€™d want to go to see castles here; she should think weâ€™d want to wait till we got to italy. it seems as if t

â€œah yes! in england there are beautiful castles,â€ said winterbourne. â€œbut chillon here, is very well worth seeing.â€
â€œwell, if daisy feels up to itâ€”â€ said mrs. miller, in a tone impregnated with a sense of the magnitude of the enterprise. â€œit seems as if there was nothing she wouldnâ€™t undertake.â€
â€œoh, i think sheâ€™ll enjoy it!â€ winterbourne declared. and he desired more and more to make it a certainty that he was to have the privilege of a tete-a-tete with the young lady, who was still strolling along in front of them, softly vocalizing. â€œ

you are not disposed, madam,â€ he inquired, â€œto undertake it yourself?â€
daisyâ€™s mother looked at him an instant askance, and then walked forward in silence. thenâ€”â€œi guess she had better go alone,â€ she said simply. winterbourne observed to himself that this was a very different type of maternity from that of the vigilant matrons who massed themselves in the forefront of social intercourse in the dark old city at the other end of the lake. but his meditations were interrupted by hearing his name very distinctly pronounced by mrs. millerâ€™s unprotected daughter.
â€œmr. winterbourne!â€ murmured daisy.
â€œmademoiselle!â€ said the young man.
â€œdonâ€™t you want to take me out in a boat?â€
â€œat present?â€ he asked.
â€

œof course!â€ said daisy.
â€œwell, annie miller!â€ exclaimed her mother.
â€œi beg you, madam, to let her go,â€ said winterbourne ardently; for he had never yet enjoyed the sensation of guiding through the summer starlight a skiff freighted with a fresh and beautiful young girl.
â€œi shouldnâ€™t think sheâ€™d want to,â€ said her mother. â€œi should think sheâ€™d rather go indoors.â€
â€œiâ€™m sure mr. winterbourne wants to take me,â€ daisy declared. â€œheâ€™s so awfully devoted!â€
â€œi will row you over to chillon in the starlight.â€
â€œi donâ€™t believe it!â€ said daisy.
â€œwell!â€ ejaculated the elder lady again.
â€œyou havenâ€™t spoken to me for half an hour,â€ her daughter went on.
â€œi have been having some very pleasant conversation with your mother,â€ said winterbourne.
â€œwell, i want you to take me out in a boat!â€ daisy repeated. they had all stopped, and she had turned round and was lo

oking at winterbourne. her face wore a charming smile, her pretty eyes were gleaming, she was swinging her great fan about. no; itâ€™s impossible to be prettier than that, thought winterbourne.
â€œthere are half a dozen boats moored at that landing place,â€ he said, pointing to certain steps which descended from the garden to the lake. â€œif you will do me the honor to accept my arm, we will go and select one of them.â€
daisy stood there smiling; she threw back her head and gave a little, light laugh. â€œi like a gentleman to be formal!â€ she declared.
â€œi assure you itâ€™s a formal offer.â€
â€œi was bound i would make you say something,â€ daisy went on.

â€œi think not, sir,â€ remarked mrs. miller very gently.
â€œdo, then, let me give you a row,â€ he said to the young girl.
â€œitâ€™s quite lovely, the way you say that!â€ cried daisy.
â€œit will be still more lovely to do it.â€
â€œyes, it would be lovely!â€ said daisy. but she made no movement to accompany him; she only stood there laughing.
â€œi should think you had better find out what time it is,â€ interposed her mother.
â€œit is eleven oâ€™cl

ock, madam,â€ said a voice, with a foreign accent, out of the neighboring darkness; and winterbourne, turning, perceived the florid personage who was in attendance upon the two ladies. he had apparently just approached.
â€œoh, eugenio,â€ said daisy, â€œi am going out in a boat!â€
eugenio bowed. â€œat eleven oâ€™clock, mademoiselle?â€
â€œi am going with mr. winterbourneâ€”this very minute.â€
â€œdo tell her she canâ€™t,â€ said mrs. miller to the courier.
â€œi think you had better not go out in a boat, mademoiselle,â€ eugenio declared.
winterbourne wished to heaven this pretty girl were not so familiar with her courier; but he said nothing.
â€œi suppose you donâ€™t think itâ€™s proper!â€ daisy exclaimed. â€œeugenio doesnâ€™t think anythingâ€™s proper.â€
â€œi am at your service,â€ said winterbourne.
â€œdoes mademoiselle propose to go alone?â€ asked eugenio

â€œoh, no; with this gentleman!â€ answered daisyâ€™s mamma.
the courier looked for a moment at winterbourneâ€”the latter thought he was smilingâ€”and then, solemnly, with a bow, â€œas mademoiselle pleases!â€ he said.
â€œoh, i hoped you would make a fuss!â€ said daisy. â€œi donâ€™t care to go now.â€
â€œi myself shall make a fuss if you donâ€™t go,â€ said winterbourne.
â€œthatâ€™s all i wantâ€”a little fuss!â€ and the young girl began to laugh again.
â€œmr. randolph has gone to bed!â€ the courier announced frigidly.
â€œoh, daisy; now we can go!â€ said mrs. miller.
daisy turned away from winterbourne, looking at him, smiling and fanning herself. â€œgood night,â€ she said; â€œi hope you are disappointed, or disgusted, or something!â€
he looked at her, taking the hand she offered him. â€œi am puzzled,â€ he answered.
â€œwell, i hope it wonâ€™t keep you awa

winterbourne stood looking after them; he was indeed puzzled. he lingered beside the lake for a quarter of an hour, turning over the mystery of the young girlâ€™s sudden familiarities and caprices. but the only very definite conclusion he came to was that he should enjoy deucedly â€œgoing offâ€ with her somewhere.
two days afterward he went off with her to the castle of chillon. he waited for her in the large hall of the hotel, where the couriers, the servants, the foreign tourists, were lounging about and

 staring. it was not the place he should have chosen, but she had appointed it. she came tripping downstairs, buttoning her long gloves, squeezing her folded parasol against her pretty figure, dressed in the perfection of a soberly elegant traveling costume. winterbourne was a man of imagination and, as our ancestors used to say, sensibility; as he looked at her dress and, on the great staircase, her little rapid, confiding step, he felt as if there were something romantic going forward. he could have believed he was going to elope with her. he passed out with her among all the idle people that were assembled there; they were all looking at her very hard; she had begun to chatter as soon as she joined him. winterbourneâ€™s preference had been that they should b

e conveyed to chillon in a carriage; but she expressed a lively wish to go in the little steamer; she declared that she had a passion for steamboats. there was always such a lovely breeze upon the water, and you saw such lots of people. the sail was not long, but winterbourneâ€™s companion found time to say a great many things. to the young man himself their little excursion was so much of an escapadeâ€”an adventureâ€”that, even allowing for her habitual sense of freedom, he had some expectation of seeing her regard it in the same way. but it must be confessed that, in this particular, he was disappointed. daisy miller was extremely animated, she was in charming spirits; but she was apparently not at all excited; she was not fluttered; she avoided neither his eyes n

or those of anyone else; she blushed neither when she looked at him nor when she felt that people were looking at her. people continued to look at her a great deal, and winterbourne took much satisfaction in his pretty companionâ€™s distinguished air. he had been a little afraid that she would talk loud, laugh overmuch, and even, perhaps, desire to move about the boat a good deal. but he quite forgot his fears; he sat smiling, with his eyes upon her face, while, without moving from her place, she delivered herself of a great number of original reflections. it was the most charming garrulity he had ever heard. he had assented to the idea that she was â€œcommonâ€; but was s

he so, after all, or was he simply getting used to her commonness? her conversation was chiefly of what metaphysicians term the objective cast, but every now and then it took a subjective turn.
â€œwhat on earth are you so grave about?â€ she suddenly demanded, fixing her agreeable eyes upon winterbourneâ€™s.
â€œam i grave?â€ he asked. â€œi had an idea i was grinning from ear to ear.â€
â€œyou look as if you were taking me to a funeral. if thatâ€™s a grin, your ears are very near together.â€
â€œshould you like me to dance a hornpipe on the deck?â€
â€œpray do, and iâ€™ll carry round your hat. it will pay the expenses of our journey.â€
â€œi never was better pleased in my life,â€ murmured winterbourne.
she looked at him a moment and then burst into a little laugh. â€œi like to make you say th

ose things! youâ€™re a queer mixture!â€
in the castle, after they had landed, the subjective element decidedly prevailed. daisy tripped about the vaulted chambers, rustled her skirts in the corkscrew staircases, flirted back with a pretty little cry and a shudder from the edge of the oubliettes, and turned a singularly well-shaped ear to everything that winterbourne told her about the place. but he saw that she cared very little for feudal antiquities and that the dusky traditions of chillon made but a slight impression upon her. they had the good fortune to have been able to walk about without other companionship than that of the custodian; and winterbourne arranged with this functionary that they should not be hurriedâ€”that they should linger and pause wherever they chose. the custodian interpreted the bargain generouslyâ€”winterbourne, on his side, had

 been generousâ€”and ended by leaving them quite to themselves. miss millerâ€™s observations were not remarkable for logical consistency; for anything she wanted to say she was sure to find a pretext. she found a great many pretexts in the rugged embrasures of chillon for asking winterbourne sudden questions about himselfâ€”his family, his previous history, his tastes, his habits, his intentionsâ€”and for supplying information upon corresponding points in her own personality. of her own tastes, habits, and intentions miss miller was prepared to give the most definite, and indeed the most favorable account.
â€œwell, i hope you know enough!â€ she said to her companion, after he had told her the history of the unhappy bonivard. â€œi never saw a man that knew so much!â€ the history o

f bonivard had evidently, as they say, gone into one ear and out of the other. but daisy went on to say that she wished winterbourne would travel with them and â€œgo roundâ€ with them; they might know something, in that case. â€œdonâ€™t you want to come and teach randolph?â€ she asked. winterbourne said that nothing could possibly please him so much, but that he had unfortunately other occupations. â€œother occupations? i donâ€™t believe it!â€ said miss daisy. â€œwhat do you mean? you are not in business.â€ the young man admitted that he was not in business; but he had engagements which, even within a day or two, would force him to go back to geneva. â€œoh, bother!â€ she said; â€œi donâ€™t believe it!â€ and she began to talk about something else. but a few moments later, when he was p

ointing out to her the pretty design of an antique fireplace, she broke out irrelevantly, â€œyou donâ€™t mean to say you are going back to geneva?â€
â€œit is a melancholy fact that i shall have to return to geneva tomorrow.â€
â€œwell, mr. winterbourne,â€ said daisy, â€œi think youâ€™re horrid!â€
â€œoh, donâ€™t say such dreadful things!â€ said winterbourneâ€”â€œjust at the last!â€
â€œthe last!â€ cried the young girl; â€œi call it the first. i have half a mind to leave you here and go straight back to the hotel alone.â€ and for the next ten minutes she did nothing but call him horrid. poor winterbourne was fairly bewildered; no young lady had as yet done him the honor to be so agitated by the announcement of his movements. his companion, after this, ceased to pay any attention to the curiosities of chillon or the beauties of the lake; she opene

d fire upon the mysterious charmer in geneva whom she appeared to have instantly taken it for granted that he was hurrying back to see. how did miss daisy miller know that there was a charmer in geneva? winterbourne, who denied the existence of such a person, was quite unable to discover, and he was divided between amazement at the rapidity of her induction and amusement at the frankness of her persiflage. she seemed to him, in all this, an extraordinary mixture of innocence and crudity. â€œdoes she never allow you more than three days at a time?â€ asked daisy ironically. â€œdoesnâ€™t she give you a vacation in summer? thereâ€™s no one so hard worked but they can get leave to go off somewhere at this seas

on. i suppose, if you stay another day, sheâ€™ll come after you in the boat. do wait over till friday, and i will go down to the landing to see her arrive!â€ winterbourne began to think he had been wrong to feel disappointed in the temper in which the young lady had embarked. if he had missed the personal accent, the personal accent was now making its appearance. it sounded very distinctly, at last, in her telling him she would stop â€œteasingâ€ him if he would promise her solemnly to come down to rome in the winter.
â€œthatâ€™s not a difficult promise to make,â€ said winterbourne. â€œmy aunt has taken an apartment in rome for the winter and has already asked

me to come and see her.â€
â€œi donâ€™t want you to come for your aunt,â€ said daisy; â€œi want you to come for me.â€ and this was the only allusion that the young man was ever to hear her make to his invidious kinswoman. he declared that, at any rate, he would certainly come. after this daisy stopped teasing. winterbourne took a carriage, and they drove back to vevey in the dusk; the young girl was very quiet.
in the evening winterbourne mentioned to mrs. costello that he had spent the afternoon at chillon with miss daisy miller.
â€œthe americansâ€”of the courier?â€ asked this lady.
â€œah, happily,â€ said winterbourne, â€œthe courier stayed at home.â€
â€œshe went with you all alone?â€
â€œall alone.â€
mrs. costello sniffed a little at her smelling bottle. â€œand that,â€ she exclaimed, â€œis the young person whom you wanted me to know!â€

 letters from her. â€œthose people you were so devoted to last summer at vevey have turned up here, courier and all,â€ she wrote. â€œthey seem to have made several acquaintances, but the courier continues to be the most intime. the young lady, however, is also very intimate with some third-rate italians, with whom she rackets about in a way that makes much talk. bring me that pretty novel of cherbuliezâ€™sâ€”paule mereâ€”and donâ€™t come later than the 23rd.â€
in the natural course of events, winterbourne, on arriving in rome, would presently have ascertained mrs. millerâ€™s address at the american bankerâ€™s and have gone to pay his compliments to miss daisy. â€œafter what happened at vevey, i think i may certainly call upon them,â€ he said to mrs. costello.
â€œif, after what happensâ€”at vevey and everywhereâ€”you desire to keep up the acquaintance, you are very welcome. of course a man may know everyone. men are welcome to the privilege!â€
â€œpray what is it that happensâ€”here, for instanc

e?â€ winterbourne demanded.
â€œthe girl goes about alone with her foreigners. as to what happens further, you must apply elsewhere for information. she has picked up half a dozen of the regular roman fortune hunters, and she takes them about to peopleâ€™s houses. when she comes to a party she brings with her a gentleman with a good deal of manner and a wonderful mustache.â€
â€œand where is the mother?â€
â€œi havenâ€™t the least idea. they are very dreadful people.â€
winterbourne meditated a moment. â€œthey are very ignorantâ€”very innocent only. depend upon it they are not bad.â€
â€œthey are hopelessly vulgar,â€ said mrs. costello. â€œwhether or no being hopelessly vulgar is being â€˜badâ€™ is a question for the metaphysicians. they are bad enough to dislike, at any rate; and for this short life that is quite enough.â€
the news that daisy miller was surrounded by half a dozen wonderful mustaches checked winterbourneâ€™s impulse to go straightway to see her. he had,

perhaps, not definitely flattered himself that he had made an ineffaceable impression upon her heart, but he was annoyed at hearing of a state of affairs so little in harmony with an image that had lately flitted in and out of his own meditations; the image of a very pretty girl looking out of an old roman window and asking herself urgently when mr. winterbourne would arrive. if, however, he determined to wait a little before reminding miss miller of his claims to her consideration, he went very soon to call upon two or three other friends. one of these friends was an american lady who had spent several winters at geneva, where she had placed her children at school. she was a very accomplished woman, and she lived in the via gregoriana. winterbourne found her in a little crimson drawing room on a third floor; the room was filled with southern sunshine.

 he had not been there ten minutes when the servant came in, announcing â€œmadame mila!â€ this announcement was presently followed by the entrance of little randolph miller, who stopped in the middle of the room and stood staring at winterbourne. an instant later his pretty sister crossed the threshold; and then, after a considerable interval, mrs. miller slowly advanced.
â€œi know you!â€ said randolph.
â€œiâ€™m sure you know a great many things,â€ exclaimed winterbourne, taking him by the hand. â€œhow is your education coming on?â€
daisy was exchanging greetings very prettily with her hostess, but when she heard winterbourneâ€™s voice she quickly turned her head. â€œwell, i declare!â€ she said.
â€œi told you i should come, you know,â€ winterbourne rejoined, smiling.
â€œwell, i didnâ€™t believe it,â€ said miss daisy.
â€œi am much obliged to you,â€ laughed the young man.
â€œyou might have come to see me!â€ said daisy.
â€œi arrived only yesterday.â€

winterbourne turned with a protesting smile to her mother, but this lady evaded his glance, and, seating herself, fixed her eyes upon her son. â€œweâ€™ve got a bigger place than this,â€ said randolph. â€œitâ€™s all gold on the walls.â€
mrs. miller turned uneasily in her chair. â€œi told you if i were to bring you, you would say something!â€ she murmured.
â€œi told you!â€ randolph exclaimed. â€œi tell you, sir!â€ he added jocosely, giving winterbourne a thump on the knee. â€œit is bigger, too!â€
daisy had entered upon a lively conversation with her hostess; winterbourne judged it becoming to address a few words to her mother. â€œi hope you have been well since we parted at vevey,â€ he said.
mrs. miller now certainly looked at himâ€”at his chin. â€œnot very well, sir,â€ she answered.
â€œsheâ€™s got the dyspepsia,â€ said randolph. â€œiâ€™ve got it too. fatherâ€™s got it. iâ€™ve got it most!â€

winterbourne had a good deal of pathological gossip with dr. davisâ€™s patient, during which daisy chattered unremittingly to her own companion. the young man asked mrs. miller how she was pleased with rome. â€œwell, i must say i am disappointed,â€ she answered. â€œwe had heard so much about it; i suppose we had heard too much. but we couldnâ€™t help that. we had been led to expect something different.â€
â€œah, wait a little, and you will become very fond of it,â€ said winterbourne.

â€œyou are like the infant hannibal,â€ said winterbourne.
â€œno, i ainâ€™t!â€ randolph declared at a venture.
â€œyou are not much like an infant,â€ said his mother. â€œbut we have seen places,â€ she resumed, â€œthat i should put a long way before rome.â€ and in reply to winterbourneâ€™s interrogation, â€œthereâ€™s zurich,â€ she concluded, â€œi think zurich is lovely; and we hadnâ€™t heard half so much about it.â€
â€œthe best place weâ€™ve seen is the city of richmond!â€ said randolph.
â€œhe means the ship,â€ his mother explained. â€œwe crossed in that ship. randolph had a good time on the city of richmond.â€
â€œitâ€™s the best place iâ€™ve seen,â€ the child repeated. â€œonly it was turned the wrong way.â€
â€œwell, weâ€™ve got to turn the right way some time,â€ said

 mrs. miller with a little laugh. winterbourne expressed the hope that her daughter at least found some gratification in rome, and she declared that daisy was quite carried away. â€œitâ€™s on account of the societyâ€”the societyâ€™s splendid. she goes round everywhere; she has made a great number of acquaintances. of course she goes round more than i do. i must say they have been very sociable; they have taken her right in. and then she knows a great many gentlemen. oh, she thinks thereâ€™s nothing like rome. of course, itâ€™s a great deal

by this time daisy had turned her attention again to winterbourne. â€œiâ€™ve been telling mrs. walker how mean you were!â€ the young girl announced.
â€œand what is the evidence you have offered?â€ asked winterbourne, rather annoyed at miss millerâ€™s want of appreciation of the zeal of an admirer who on his way down to rome had stopped neither at bologna nor at florence, simply because of a certain sentimental impatience. he remembered that a cynical compatriot had once told him that american womenâ€”the pretty ones, and this gave a largeness to the axiomâ€”were at once the most exacting in the world and the least endowed with a sense of indebtedness.
â€œwhy, you were awfully mean at vevey,â€ said daisy.

â€œmy dearest young lady,â€ cried winterbourne, with eloquence, â€œhave i come all the way to rome to encounter your reproaches?â€
â€œjust hear him say that!â€ said daisy to her hostess, giving a twist to a bow on this ladyâ€™s dress. â€œdid you ever hear anything so quaint?â€
â€œso quaint, my dear?â€ murmured mrs. walker in the tone of a partisan of winterbourne.
â€œwell, i donâ€™t know,â€ said daisy, fingering mrs. walkerâ€™s ribbons. â€œmrs. walker, i want to tell you something.â€
â€œmother-r,â€ interposed randolph, with his rough ends to his words, â€œi tell you youâ€™ve got to go. eugenioâ€™ll raiseâ€”something!â€
â€œiâ€™m not afraid of eugenio,â€ said daisy with a toss of her head. â€œlook here, mrs. walker,â€ she went on, â€œyou know iâ€™m coming to your party.â€

â€œoh, they are not my friends,â€ answered daisyâ€™s mamma, smiling shyly in her own fashion. â€œi never spoke to them.â€
â€œitâ€™s an intimate friend of mineâ€”mr. giovanelli,â€ said daisy without a tremor in her clear little voice or a shadow on her brilliant little face.
mrs. walker was silent a moment; she gave a rapid glance at winterbourne. â€œi shall be glad to see mr. giovanelli,â€ she then said.
â€œheâ€™s an italian,â€ daisy pursued with the prettiest serenity. â€œheâ€™s a great friend of mine; heâ€™s the handsomest man in the worldâ€”except mr. winterbourne! he knows plenty of italians, but he wants to know some americans. he thinks ever so much of americans. heâ€™s tremendously clever. heâ€™s perfectly lovely!â€
it was settled that this brilliant personage should be brought to mrs. walkerâ€™s party, and then mrs. miller p

the company had risen to its feet; daisy, still showing her pretty teeth, bent over and kissed her hostess. â€œmrs. walker, you are too perfect,â€ she said. â€œiâ€™m not going alone; i am going to meet a friend.â€
â€œyour friend wonâ€™t keep you from getting the fever,â€ mrs. miller observed.
â€œis it mr. giovanelli?â€ asked the hostess.
winterbourne was watching the young girl; at this question his attention quickened. she stood there, smiling and smoothing her bonnet ribbons; she glanced at winterbourne. then, while she glanced and smiled, she answered, without a shade of hesitation, â€œmr. giovanelliâ€”the beautiful giovanelli.â€
â€œmy dear young friend,â€ said mrs. walker, taking her hand pleadingly, â€œdonâ€™t walk off to the pincio at this hour to meet a beautiful italian.â€
â€œwell, he speaks english,â€ said mrs. miller.

winterbourneâ€™s politeness hastened to affirm itself, and the young girl gave him gracious leave to accompany her. they passed downstairs before her mother, and at the door winterbourne perceived mrs. millerâ€™s carriage drawn up, with the ornamental courier whose acquaintance he had made at vevey seated within. â€œgoodbye, eugenio!â€ cried daisy; â€œiâ€™m going to take a walk.â€ the distance from the via gregoriana to the beautiful garden at the other end of the pincian hill is, in fact, rapidly traversed. as the day was splendid, however, and the concourse of vehicles, walkers, and loungers numerous, the young americans found their progress much delayed. this fact was high

ly agreeable to winterbourne, in spite of his consciousness of his singular situation. the slow-moving, idly gazing roman crowd bestowed much attention upon the extremely pretty young foreign lady who was passing through it upon his arm; and he wondered what on earth had been in daisyâ€™s mind when she proposed to expose herself, unattended, to its appreciation. his own mission, to her sense, apparently, was to consign her to the hands of mr. giovanelli; but winterbourne, at once annoyed and gratified, resolved that he would do no such thing.
â€œwhy havenâ€™t you been to see me?â€ asked daisy. â€œyou canâ€™t get out of that.â€
â€œi have had the honor of telling you that i have only just stepped out of the train.â€
â€œyou must have stayed in the train a good while after it stopped!â€ cried the young girl with her little laugh. â€œi suppose you were asleep. you have had time to go to see mrs. walker.â€

â€œi certainly shall not help you to find him,â€ winterbourne declared.
â€œthen i shall find him without you,â€ cried miss daisy.
â€œyou certainly wonâ€™t leave me!â€ cried winterbourne.
she burst into her little laugh. â€œare you afraid youâ€™ll get lostâ€”or run over? but thereâ€™s giovanelli, leaning against that tree. heâ€™s staring at the women in the carriages: did you ever see anything so cool?â€
winterbourne perceived at some distance a little man standing with folded arms nursing his cane. he had a handsome face, an artfully poised hat, a glas

â€œdo i mean to speak to him? why, you donâ€™t suppose i mean to communicate by signs?â€
â€œpray understand, then,â€ said winterbourne, â€œthat i intend to remain with you.â€
daisy stopped and looked at him, without a sign of troubled consciousness in her face, with nothing but the presence of her charming eyes and her happy dimples. â€œwell, sheâ€™s a cool one!â€ thought the young man.
â€œi donâ€™t like the way you say that,â€ said daisy. â€œitâ€™s too imperious.â€
â€œi beg your pardon if i say it wrong. the main point is to give you an idea of my meaning.â€

daisy began to laugh again. â€œi do nothing but listen to gentlemen!â€ she exclaimed. â€œtell me if mr. giovanelli is the right one?â€
the gentleman with the nosegay in his bosom had now perceived our two friends, and was approaching the young girl with obsequious rapidity. he bowed to winterbourne as well as to the latterâ€™s companion; he had a brilliant smile, an intelligent eye; winterbourne thought him not a bad-looking f

daisy evidently had a natural talent for performing introductions; she mentioned the name of each of her companions to the other. she strolled alone with one of them on each side of her; mr. giovanelli, who spoke english very cleverlyâ€”winterbourne afterward learned that he had practiced the idiom upon a great many american heiressesâ€”addressed her a great deal of very polite nonsense; he was extremely urbane, and the young american, who said nothing, reflected upon that profundity of italian cleverness which enables people to appear more gracious in proportion as they are more acutely disappointed. giovanelli, of course, had counted upon something more intimate; he had not bargained for a party of three. but he kept his temper in a mann

she had been walking some quarter of an hour, attended by her two cavaliers, and responding in a tone of very childish gaiety, as it seemed to winterbourne, to the pretty speeches of mr. giovanelli, when a carriage that had detached itself from the revolving train drew up beside the path. at the same moment winterbourne perceived that his friend mrs. walkerâ€”the lady whose house he had lately leftâ€”was seated in the vehicle and was beckoning to him. leaving miss millerâ€™s side, he hastened to obey her summons. mrs. walker was flushed; she wore an excited air. â€œit is really too dreadful,â€ she said. â€œthat girl must not do this sort of thing

â€œshe is very innocent,â€ said winterbourne.
â€œsheâ€™s very crazy!â€ cried mrs. walker. â€œdid you ever see anything so imbecile as her mother? after you had all left me just now, i could not sit still for thinking of it. it seemed too pitiful, not even to attempt to save her. i ordered the carriage and put on my bonnet, and came here as quickly as possible. thank heaven i have found you!â€

â€œit may be enchanting, dear child, but it is not the custom here,â€ urged mrs. walker, leaning forward in her victoria, with her hands devoutly clasped.
â€œwell, it ought to be, then!â€ said daisy. â€œif i didnâ€™t walk i should expire.â€
â€œyou should walk with your mother, dear,â€ cried the lady from geneva, losing patience.
â€œwith my mother dear!â€ exclaimed the young girl. winterbourne saw that she scented interference. â€œmy mother never walked ten steps in her life. and then, you know,â€ she added with a laugh, â€œi am more than five years old.â€
â€œyou are old enough to be more reasonable. you are old enough, dear miss miller, to be talked about.â€
daisy looked at mrs. walker, smiling intensely. â€œtalked about? what do you mean?â€

winterbourne wished that mrs. walker would tuck in her carriage rug and drive away, but this lady did not enjoy being defied, as she afterward told him. â€œshould you prefer being thought a very reckless girl?â€ she demanded.
â€œgracious!â€ exclaimed daisy. she looked again at mr. giovanelli, then she turned to winterbourne. there was a little pink flush in her cheek; she was tremendously pretty. â€œdoes mr. winterbourne think,â€ she asked slowly, smiling, throwing back her head, and glancing at him from

daisy gave a violent laugh. â€œi never heard anything so stiff! if this is improper, mrs. walker,â€ she pursued, â€œthen i am all improper, and you must give me up. goodbye; i hope youâ€™ll have a lovely ride!â€ and, with mr. giovanelli,

mrs. walker sat looking after her, and there were tears in mrs. walkerâ€™s eyes. â€œget in here, sir,â€ she said to winterbourne, indicating the place beside her. the young man answered that he felt bound to accompany miss miller, whereupon mrs. walker declared that if he refused her this favor she would never speak to him again. she was evidently in earnest. winterbourne overtook daisy and her companion, and, offering the young girl his hand, told her that mrs. walker had made an imperious claim upon his society. he expected that in answer she would say something rather free, something to commit herself still further to that â€œrecklessnessâ€ from which mrs. walker had so charitably endeavored to dissuade her. but she only shook his hand, hardly looking at him, while mr. giovanelli bade him farewell with a too emphatic flourish of the hat.

â€œin such a case,â€ his companion answered, â€œi donâ€™t wish to be clever; i wish to be earnest!â€
â€œwell, your earnestness has only offended her and put her off.â€
â€œit has happened very well,â€ said mrs. walker. â€œif she is so perfectly determined to compromise herself, the sooner one knows it the better; one can act accordingly.â€
â€œi suspect she meant no harm,â€ winterbourne rejoined.
â€œso i thought a month ago. but she has been going too far.â€
â€œwhat has she been doing?â€
â€œeverything that is not done here. flirting with any man she could pick up; sitting in corners with mysterious italians; dancing all the evening with the same partners; receiving visits at eleven oâ€™clock at night. her mother goes away when visitors come.â€

â€œshe is naturally indelicate,â€ mrs. walker declared.

â€œiâ€™m afraid i canâ€™t do that,â€ said winterbourne. â€œi like her extremely.â€

â€œthere shall be nothing scandalous in my attentions to her.â€
â€œthere certainly will be in the way she takes them. but i have said what i had on my conscience,â€ mrs. walker pursued. â€œif you wish to rejoin the young lady i will put you down. here, by the way, you have a chance.â€

the beautiful villa borghese. it is bordered by a large parapet, near which there are several seats. one of the seats at a distance was occupied by a gentleman and a lady, toward whom mrs. walker gave a toss of her head. at the same moment these persons rose and walked toward the parapet. winterbourne had asked the coachman to stop; he now descended from the carriage. his companion looked at him a moment in silence; then, while he raised his hat, she drove majestically away. winterbourne stood there; he had turned his eyes toward daisy and her cavalier. they evidently saw no one; they were too deeply occupied with each other. when they reached the low garden wall, they stood a moment looking off at the great flat-topped pine clusters of the villa borghese; then giovanelli seated himself, familiarly, upon the broad ledge of the wall. the western sun in the opposite sky sent out a brilliant shaft through a couple of cloud bars, whereupon daisyâ€™s companion took her parasol out o

he flattered himself on the following day that there was no smiling among the servants when he, at least, asked for mrs. miller at her hotel. this lady and her daughter, however, were not at home; and on the next day after, repeating his visit, winterbourne again had the misfortune not to find them. mrs. walkerâ€™s party took place on

 the evening of the third day, and, in spite of the frigidity of his last interview with the hostess, winterbourne was among the guests. mrs. walker was one of those american ladies who, while residing abroad, make a point, in their own phrase, of studying european society, and she had on this occasion collected several specimens of her diversely born fellow mortals to serve, as it were, as textbooks. when winterbourne arrived, daisy miller was not there, but in a few moments he saw her mother come in alone, very shyly and ruefully. mrs. millerâ€™s hair above her exposed-looking temples was more frizzled than ever. as she approached mrs. walker, winterbourne also drew near.
â€œyou see, iâ€™ve come all alone,â€ said poor mrs. miller. â€œiâ€™m so frightened; i donâ€™t know what to do. itâ€™s the first time iâ€™ve ever been to a party alone, especially in this country. i wanted to bring randolph or eugenio, or

â€œiâ€™m sorry she should come in that way,â€ said mrs. walker.
â€œwell, i told her that there was no use in her getting dressed before dinner if she was going to wait three hours,â€ responded daisyâ€™s mamma. â€œi didnâ€™t see the use of her putting on such a dress as that to sit round with mr. giovanelli.â€
â€œthis is most horrible!â€ said mrs. walker, turning away and addressing herself to winterbourne. â€œelle sâ€™affiche. itâ€™s her revenge for my having ventured to remonstrate with her. when she comes, i shall not speak to her.â€
daisy came after eleven oâ€™clock; but she was not, on such an occasion, a young lady to wait to be spoken to. she rustled forward in radiant loveliness, smiling and chattering, carrying a large bouquet, and attended by mr. giovanelli. everyone stopped talking and turned and looked at her. she came straight to mrs. walker. â€œiâ€™m afraid you thought i never was

er functions of a handsome italian at an evening party. he sang very prettily half a dozen songs, though mrs. walker afterward declared that she had been quite unable to find out who asked him. it was apparently not daisy who had given him his orders. daisy sat at a distance from the piano, and though she had publicly, as it were, professed a high admiration for his singing, talked, not inaudibly, while it was going on.
â€œitâ€™s a pity these rooms are so small; we canâ€™t dance,â€ she said to winterbourne, as if she had seen him five minutes before.
â€œi am not sorry we canâ€™t dance,â€ winterbourne answered; â€œi donâ€™t dance.â€
â€œof course you donâ€™t dance; youâ€™re too stiff,â€ said miss daisy. â€œi hope you enjoyed your drive with mrs. walker!â€
â€œno. i didnâ€™t enjoy it; i preferred walking with you.â€

â€œyouâ€™re a very nice girl; but i wish you would flirt with me, and me only,â€ said winterbourne.
â€œah! thank youâ€”thank you very much; you are the last man i should think of flirting with. as i have had the pleasure of informing you, you are too stiff.â€
â€œyou say that too often,â€ said winterbourne.
daisy gave a delighted laugh. â€œif i could have the sweet hope of making you angry, i should say it again.â€
â€œdonâ€™t do that; when i am angry iâ€™m stiffer than ever. but if you wonâ€™t flirt with me, do cease, at least, to flirt with your friend at the piano; they donâ€™t understan

â€œi thought they understood nothing else!â€ exclaimed daisy.

â€œit seems to me much more proper in young unmarried women than in old married ones,â€ daisy declared.
â€œwell,â€ said winterbourne, â€œwhen you deal with natives you must go by the custom of the place. flirting is a purely american custom; it doesnâ€™t exist here. so when you show yourself in public with mr. giovanelli, and without your motherâ€”â€
â€œgracious! poor mother!â€ interposed daisy.
â€œthough you may be flirting, mr. giovanelli is not; he means something else.â€

daisy turned to winterbourne, beginning to smile again. he was still more perplexed, for this inconsequent smile made nothing clear, though it seemed to prove, indeed, that she had a sweetness and softness that reverted instinctively to the pardon of offenses. â€œit has never occurred to mr. winterbourne to offer me any tea,â€ she said with her little tormenting manner.

pale, grave face at the circle near the door; winterbourne saw that, for the first moment, she was too much shocked and puzzled even for indignation. he on his side was greatly touched.
â€œthat was very cruel,â€ he said to mrs. walker.
â€œshe never enters my drawing room again!â€ replied his hostess.
since winterbourne was not to meet her in mrs. walkerâ€™s drawing room, he went as often as possible to mrs. millerâ€™s hotel. the ladies were rarely at home, but when he found them, the devoted giovanelli was always present. very often the brilliant little roman was in the drawing room with daisy alone, mrs. miller being apparently constantly of the opinion that discretion is the better part of surveillance. winterbourne noted, at first with surprise, that daisy on these occasions was never embarrassed or annoye

d by his own entrance; but he very presently began to feel that she had no more surprises for him; the unexpected in her behavior was the only thing to expect. she showed no displeasure at her tete-a-tete with giovanelli being interrupted; she could chatter as freshly and freely with two gentlemen as with one; there was always, in her conversation, the same odd mixture of audacity and puerility. winterbourne remarked to himself that if she was seriously interested in giovanelli, it was very singular that she should not take more trouble to preserve the sanctity of their interviews; and he liked her the more for her innocent-looking indifference and her apparently inexhaustible good humor. he could hardly have said why, but she seemed to him a girl who would never be jealous. at the risk of exciting a somewhat derisive smile on the readerâ€™s part, i may affirm that with regard to the women who had

hitherto interested him, it very often seemed to winterbourne among the possibilities that, given certain contingencies, he should be afraidâ€”literally afraidâ€”of these ladies; he had a pleasant sense that he should never be afraid of daisy miller. it must be added that this sentiment was not altogether flattering to daisy; it was part of his conviction, or rather of his apprehension, that she would prove a very light young person.
but she was evidently very much interested in giovanelli. she looked at him whenever he spoke; she was perpetually telling

him to do this and to do that; she was constantly â€œchaffingâ€ and abusing him. she appeared completely to have forgotten that winterbourne had said anything to displease her at mrs. walkerâ€™s little party. one sunday afternoon, having gone to st. peterâ€™s with his aunt, winterbourne perceived daisy strolling about the great church in company with the inevitable giovanelli. presently he pointed out the young girl and her cavalier to mrs. costello. this lady looked at them a moment through her eyeglass, and then she said:
â€œthatâ€™s what makes you so pensive in these days, eh?â€
â€œi had not the least idea i was pensive,â€ said the young man.
â€œyou are very much preoccupied; you are thinking of something.â€
â€œand what is it,â€ he asked, â€œthat you accuse me of thinki

ng of?â€
â€œof that young ladyâ€™sâ€”miss bakerâ€™s, miss chandlerâ€™sâ€”whatâ€™s her name?â€”miss millerâ€™s intrigue with that little barberâ€™s block.â€
â€œdo you call it an intrigue,â€ winterbourne askedâ€”â€œan affair that goes on with such peculiar publicity?â€
â€œthatâ€™s their folly,â€ said mrs. costello; â€œitâ€™s not their merit.â€
â€œno,â€ rejoined winterbourne, with something of that pensiveness to which his aunt had alluded. â€œi donâ€™t believe that there is anything to be called an intrigue.â€
â€œi have heard a dozen people speak of it; they say she is quite carried away by him.â€
â€œthey are certainly very intimate,â€ said winterbourne.
mrs. costello inspected the young couple again with her optical instrument. â€œhe is very handsome. one easily sees how it is. she thinks him the most elegant man in the world, the finest gentleman. she has nev

er seen anything like him; he is better, even, than the courier. it was the courier probably who introduced him; and if he succeeds in marrying the young lady, the courier will come in for a magnificent commission.â€
â€œi donâ€™t believe she thinks of marrying him,â€ said winterbourne, â€œand i donâ€™t believe he hopes to marry her.â€
â€œyou may be very sure she thinks of nothing. she goes on from day to day, from hour to hour, as they did in the golden age. i can imagine nothing more vulgar. and at the same time,â€ added mrs. costello, â€œdepend upon it that she may tell you any moment that she is â€˜engaged.â€™â€
â€œi think that is more than giovanelli expects,â€ said winterbourne.
â€œwho is giovanelli?â€

rrying her. that must appear to him too impossible a piece of luck. he has nothing but his handsome face to offer, and there is a substantial mr. miller in that mysterious land of dollars. giovanelli knows that he hasnâ€™t a title to offer. if he were only a count or a marchese! he must wonder at his luck, at the way they have taken him up.â€
â€œhe accounts for it by his handsome face and thinks miss miller a young lady qui se passe ses fantaisies!â€ said mrs. costello.
â€œit is very true,â€ winterbourne pursued, â€œthat daisy and her mamma have not yet risen to that stage ofâ€”what shall i call it?â€”of culture at which the idea of catching a count or a marchese begins. i believe that they are intellectually incapable of that conception.â€
â€œah! but the avvocato canâ€™t believe it,â€ said mrs. costello.
of the observation excited by daisyâ€™s â€œintrigue,â€ winterbourne gathered that day at st. peterâ€™s sufficient evidence. a dozen of the american colonists in rome came to talk with mrs.

 he met one day in the corso a friend, a tourist like himself, who had just come out of the doria palace, where he had been walking through the beautiful gallery. his friend talked for a moment about the superb portrait of innocent x by velasquez which hangs in one of the cabinets of the palace, and then said, â€œand in the same cabinet, by the way, i had the pleasure of contemplating a picture of a different kindâ€”that pretty american girl whom you pointed out to me last week.â€ in answer to winterbourneâ€™s inquiries, his friend narrated that the pretty american girlâ€”prettier than everâ€”was seated with a companion in the secluded nook in which the great papal portrait was enshrined.
â€œwho was her companion?â€ asked winterbourne.
â€œa little italian with a bouquet in his buttonhole. the girl is delightfully pretty, but i thought i understood from you the other day that she was a young lady du meilleur monde.â€
â€œso she is!â€ answered winterbourne; and having assured himself that his inf

â€œsheâ€™s gone out somewhere with mr. giovanelli,â€ said mrs. miller. â€œsheâ€™s always going round with mr. giovanelli.â€
â€œi have noticed that they are very intimate,â€ winterbourne observed.
â€œoh, it seems as if they couldnâ€™t live without each other!â€ said mrs. miller. â€œwell, heâ€™s a real gentleman, anyhow. i keep telling daisy sheâ€™s engaged!â€
â€œand what does daisy say?â€
â€œoh, she says she isnâ€™t engaged. but she might as well be!â€ this impartial parent resumed; â€œshe goes on as if she was. but iâ€™ve made mr. giovanelli promise to tell me, if she doesnâ€™t. i should want to write to mr. miller about itâ€”shouldnâ€™t you?â€
winterbourne replied that h

e certainly should; and the state of mind of daisyâ€™s mamma struck him as so unprecedented in the annals of parental vigilance that he gave up as utterly irrelevant the attempt to place her upon her guard.
after this daisy was never at home, and winterbourne ceased to meet her at the houses of their common acquaintances, because, as he perceived, these shrewd people had quite made up their minds that she was going too far. they ceased to invite her; and they intimated that they desired to express to observant europeans the great truth that, though miss daisy miller was a young american lady, her behavior was not representativeâ€”was regarded by her compatriots as abnormal. winterbourne wondered how she felt about all the cold shoulders that were tu

 her ostracism, or even to have perceived it. then at other moments he believed that she carried about in her elegant and irresponsible little organism a defiant, passionate, perfectly observant consciousness of the impression she produced. he asked himself whether daisyâ€™s defiance came from the consciousness of innocence, or from her being, essentially, a young person of the reckless class. it must be admitted that holding oneâ€™s self to a belief in daisyâ€™s â€œinnocenceâ€ came to seem to winterbourne more and more a matter of fine-spun gallantry. as i have already had occasion to relate, he was angry at finding himself reduced to chopping logic about this young lady; he was vexed at his want of instinctive certitude as to how far her eccentricities were generic, national, and how far they were personal. from either view of them he had somehow missed her, and now it was too late. she was â€œcarried awayâ€ by mr. giovanelli.
a few days after his brief interview with her mother, he encountere

e and color that remotely encircles the city, inhaling the softly humid odors, and feeling the freshness of the year and the antiquity of the place reaffirm themselves in mysterious interfusion. it seemed to him also that daisy had never looked so pretty, but this had been an observation of his whenever he met her. giovanelli was at her side, and giovanelli, too, wore an aspect of even unwonted brilliancy.
â€œwell,â€ said daisy, â€œi should think you would be lonesome!â€
â€œlonesome?â€ asked winterbourne.
â€œyou are always going round by yourself. canâ€™t you get anyone to walk with you?â€
â€œi am not so fortunate,â€ said winterbourne, â€œas your companion.â€
giovanelli, from the first, had treated winterbourne with distinguished politeness. he listened with a deferential air to his remarks; he laughed punctiliously at his pleasantries; he seemed disposed to testify to his belief that winterbourne was a superior young man. he carried himself in no degree like a jealous wooer; he had obviousl

y a great deal of tact; he had no objection to your expecting a little humility of him. it even seemed to winterbourne at times that giovanelli would find a certain mental relief in being able to have a private understanding with himâ€”to say to him, as an intelligent man, that, bless you, he knew how extraordinary was this young lady, and didnâ€™t flatter himself with delusiveâ€”or at least too delusiveâ€”hopes of matrimony and dollars. on this occasion he strolled away from his companion to pluck a sprig of almond blossom, which he carefully arranged in his buttonhole.

y, watching giovanelli. â€œbecause you think i go round too much with him.â€ and she nodded at her attendant.
â€œevery one thinks soâ€”if you care to know,â€ said winterbourne.
â€œof course i care to know!â€ daisy exclaimed seriously. â€œbut i donâ€™t believe it. they are only pretending to be shocked. they donâ€™t really care a straw what i do. besides, i donâ€™t go round so much.â€
â€œi think you will find they do care. they will show it disagreeably.â€
daisy looked at him a moment. â€œhow disagreeably?â€
â€œhavenâ€™t you noticed anything?â€ winterbourne asked.
â€œi have noticed you. but i noticed you were as stiff as an umbrella the first time i saw you.â€

€œyou will find i am not so stiff as several others,â€ said winterbourne, smiling.
â€œhow shall i find it?â€
â€œby going to see the others.â€
â€œwhat will they do to me?â€
â€œthey will give you the cold shoulder. do you know what that means?â€
daisy was looking at him intently; she began to color. â€œdo you mean as mrs. walker did the other night?â€
â€œexactly!â€ said winterbourne.
she looked away at giovanelli, who was decorating himself with his almond blossom. then looking back at winterbourne, â€œi shouldnâ€™t think you would let people be so unkind!â€ she said.
â€œhow can i help it?â€ he asked.
â€œi should think you would say something.â€
â€œi do say something;â€ and he paused a moment. â€œi say that your mother tells me that she believes you are engaged.â€
â€œwell, she does,â€ said daisy very simply.
winterbourne began to laugh. â€œand does randolph believe it?â€ he asked.
â€œi guess randolph doesnâ€™t believe anything,â€ said daisy. randolphâ€™s skepticism excited winterb

he was silent a moment; and then, â€œyes, i believe it,â€ he said.
â€œoh, no, you donâ€™t!â€ she answered. â€œwell, thenâ€”i am not!â€
the young girl and her cicerone were on their way to the gate of the enclosure, so that winterbourne, who had but lately entered, presently took leave of them. a week afterward he went to dine at a beautiful villa on the caelian hill, and, on arriving, dismissed his hired vehicle. t

he evening was charming, and he promised himself the satisfaction of walking home beneath the arch of constantine and past the vaguely lighted monuments of the forum. there was a waning moon in the sky, and her radiance was not brilliant, but she was veiled in a thin cloud curtain which seemed to diffuse and equalize it. when, on his return from the villa (it was eleven oâ€™clock), winterbourne approached the dusky circle of the colosseum, it recurred to him, as a lover of the picturesque, that the interior, in the pale moonshine, would be well worth a glance. he turned aside and walked to one of the empty arches, near which, as he observed, an open carriageâ€”one of the little roman streetcabsâ€”was stationed. then he passed in, among the cavernous shadows of the great structure, and emerged upon the clear and silent arena. the place had never seemed to him more impressive. one-half

presently the sound of the womanâ€™s voice came to him distinctly in the warm night air. â€œwell, he look

â€œlet us hope he is not very hungry,â€ responded the ingenious giovanelli. â€œhe will have to take me first; you will serve for dessert!â€
winterbourne stopped, with a sort of horror, and, it must be added, with a sort of relief. it was as if a sudden illumination had been flashed upon the ambiguity of daisyâ€™s behavior, and the riddle had become easy to read. she was a young lady whom a gentleman need no longer be at pains to respect. he stood there, looking at herâ€”looking at her companion and not reflecting that though he saw them vaguely, he himself must have been more brightly visible. he felt angry with himself that he had bothered so

much about the right way of regarding miss daisy miller. then, as he was going to advance again, he checked himself, not from the fear that he was doing her injustice, but from a sense of the danger of appearing unbecomingly exhilarated by this sudden revulsion from cautious criticism. he turned away toward the entrance of the place, but, as he did so, he heard daisy speak again.
â€œwhy, it was mr. winterbourne! he saw me, and he cuts me!â€
what a clever little reprobate she was, and how smartly she played at injured innocence! but he wouldnâ€™t cut her. winterbourne came forward again and went toward the great cross. daisy had got up; giovanelli lifted his hat. winterbourne had now begun to think simply of the craziness, from a sanitary point of view, of a delicate young girl lounging away the evening in this nest of malaria. what if she were a clever little reprobate? that was no reason for her dyi

ng of the perniciosa. â€œhow long have you been here?â€ he asked almost brutally.
daisy, lovely in the flattering moonlight, looked at him a moment. thenâ€”â€œall the evening,â€ she answered, gently. * * * â€œi never saw anything so pretty.â€
â€œi am afraid,â€ said winterbourne, â€œthat you will not think roman fever very pretty. this is the way people catch it. i wonder,â€ he added, turning to giovanelli, â€œthat you, a native roman, should countenance such a terrible indiscretion.â€
â€œah,â€ said the handsome native, â€œfor myself i am not afraid.â€
â€œneither am iâ€”for you! i am speaking for this young lady.â€
giovanelli lifted his well-shaped eyebrows and showed his brilliant teeth. but he took winterbourneâ€™s rebuke with docility. â€œi told the signorina i

t was a grave indiscretion, but when was the signorina ever prudent?â€
â€œi never was sick, and i donâ€™t mean to be!â€ the signorina declared. â€œi donâ€™t look like much, but iâ€™m healthy! i was bound to see the colosseum by moonlight; i shouldnâ€™t have wanted to go home without that; and we have had the most beautiful time, havenâ€™t we, mr. giovanelli? if there has been any danger, eugenio can give me some pills. he has got some splendid pills.â€
â€œi should advise you,â€ said winterbourne, â€œto drive home as fast as possible and take one!â€
â€œwhat you say is very wise,â€ giovanelli rejoined. â€œi will go and make sure the carriage is at hand.â€ and he went forward rapidly.
daisy followed with winterbourne. he kept looking at her; she seemed not in the least embarrassed. winterbourne said nothing; daisy chattered about the beauty of the place. â€œwell, i have seen the colosseum by moonlight!â€ she exclaimed. â€œthatâ€™s one good thing.â€ then, noticing winterbourneâ€™s sil

ence, she asked him why he didnâ€™t speak. he made no answer; he only began to laugh. they passed under one of the dark archways; giovanelli was in front with the carriage. here daisy stopped a moment, looking at the young american. â€œdid you believe i was engaged, the other day?â€ she asked.
â€œit doesnâ€™t matter what i believed the other day,â€ said winterbourne, still laughing.
â€œwell, what do you believe now?â€
â€œi believe that it makes very little difference whether you are engaged or not!â€
he felt the young girlâ€™s pretty eyes fixed upon him through the thick gloom of the archway; she was apparently going to answer. but giovanelli hurried her forward. â€œquick! quick!â€ he said; â€œif we get in by midnight we are quite safe.â€
daisy took her seat in the carriage, and the fortunate italian placed himself beside her. â€œdonâ€™t forget eugenio

â€œi donâ€™t care,â€ said daisy in a little strange tone, â€œwhether i have roman fever or not!â€ upon this the cab driver cracked his whip, and they rolled away over the desultory patches of the antique pavement.
winterbourne, to do him justice, as it were, mentioned to no one that he had encountered miss miller, at midnight, in the colosseum with a gentleman; but nevertheless, a couple of days later, the fact of her having been there under these circumstances was known to every member of the little american circle, and commented accordingly. winterbourne reflected that they had of course known it at the hotel, and that, after daisyâ€™s return, there had been an exchange of remarks between the porter and the cab dri

ver. but the young man was conscious, at the same moment, that it had ceased to be a matter of serious regret to him that the little american flirt should be â€œtalked aboutâ€ by low-minded menials. these people, a day or two later, had serious information to give: the little american flirt was alarmingly ill. winterbourne, when the rumor came to him, immediately went to the hotel for more news. he found that two or three charitable friends had preceded him, and that they were being entertained in mrs. millerâ€™s salon by randolph.
â€œitâ€™s going round at night,â€ said randolphâ€”â€œthatâ€™s what made her sick. sheâ€™s always going round at night. i shouldnâ€™t think sheâ€™d want to, itâ€™s so plaguy dark. you canâ€™t see anything here at night, except when thereâ€™s a moon. in america thereâ€™s always a moon!â

€ mrs. miller was invisible; she was now, at least, giving her daughter the advantage of her society. it was evident that daisy was dangerously ill.
winterbourne went often to ask for news of her, and once he saw mrs. miller, who, though deeply alarmed, was, rather to his surprise, perfectly composed, and, as it appeared, a most efficient and judicious nurse. she talked a good deal about dr. davis, but winterbourne paid her the compliment of saying to himself that she was not, after all, such a monstrous goose. â€œdaisy spoke of you the other day,â€ she said to him. â€œhalf the time she doesnâ€™t know what sheâ€™s saying, but that time i think she did. she gave me a message she told me to tell you. she told me to tell you that she never was engaged to that handsome italian. i am sure i am very glad; mr. giovanelli hasnâ€™t been near us since she was taken ill. i thought he was so much of a gentleman; but

 i donâ€™t call that very polite! a lady told me that he was afraid i was angry with him for taking daisy round at night. well, so i am, but i suppose he knows iâ€™m a lady. i would scorn to scold him. anyway, she says sheâ€™s not engaged. i donâ€™t know why she wanted you to know, but she said to me three times, â€˜mind you tell mr. winterbourne.â€™ and then she told me to ask if you remembered the time you went to that castle in switzerland. but i said i wouldnâ€™t give any such messages as that. only, if she is not engaged, iâ€™m sure iâ€™m glad to know it.â€
but, as winterbourne had said, it mattered very little. a week after this, the poor girl died; it had been a terrible case of the fever. daisyâ€™s grave was in the little protestant cemetery, in an angle of the wall of imperial rome, beneath the cypresses and the thick spring f

lowers. winterbourne stood there beside it, with a number of other mourners, a number larger than the scandal excited by the young ladyâ€™s career would have led you to expect. near him stood giovanelli, who came nearer still before winterbourne turned away. giovanelli was very pale: on this occasion he had no flower in his buttonhole; he seemed to wish to say something. at last he said, â€œshe was the most beautiful young lady i ever saw, and the most amiable;â€ and then he added in a moment, â€œand she was the most innocent.â€
winterbourne looked at him and presently repeated his words, â€œand the most innocent?â€
â€œthe most innocent!â€
winterbourne felt sore and angry. â€œwhy the devil,â€ he asked, â€œdid you take her to that

fatal place?â€
mr. giovanelliâ€™s urbanity was apparently imperturbable. he looked on the ground a moment, and then he said, â€œfor myself i had no fear; and she wanted to go.â€
â€œthat was no reason!â€ winterbourne declared.
the subtle roman again dropped his eyes. â€œif she had lived, i should have got nothing. she would never have married me, i am sure.â€
â€œshe would never have married you?â€
â€œfor a moment i hoped so. but no. i am sure.â€
winterbourne listened to him: he stood staring at the raw protuberance among the april daisies. when he turned away again, mr. giovanelli, with his light, slow step, had retired.
winterbourne almost immediately left rome; but the following summer he again met his aunt, mrs. costello at vevey. mrs. costello was fond of vevey. in the interval winterbourne had often thought of daisy miller and her mystifying manners. one day he spoke of her to his auntâ€”said it was on his conscience that he had done her injus

â€œi am sure i donâ€™t know,â€ said mrs. costello. â€œhow did your injustice affect her?â€
â€œshe sent me a message before her death which i didnâ€™t understand at the time; but i have understood it since. she would have appreciated oneâ€™s esteem.â€
â€œis that a modest way,â€ asked mrs. costello, â€œof saying that she would have reciprocated oneâ€™s affection?â€
winterbourne offered no answer to this question; but he presently said, â€œyou were right in that remark that you made last summer. i was booked to make a mistake. i have lived too long in foreign parts.â€
nevertheless, he went back to live at geneva, whence there continue to come the most contradictory accounts of his motives of sojourn: a report that he is â€œstudyingâ€ hardâ€”an intimation that he is much interested in a very clever foreign lady.
