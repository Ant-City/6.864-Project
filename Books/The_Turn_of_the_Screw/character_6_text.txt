he midst of it she came.”

“came how--from where?”

“from where they come from! she just appeared and stood there--but not
so near.”

“and without coming nearer?”

“oh, for the effect and the feeling, she might have been as close as
you!”

my friend, with an odd impulse, fell back a step. “was she someone
you’ve never seen?”

“yes. but someone the child has. someone you have.” then, to show how i
had thought it all out: “my predecessor--the one who died.”

“miss jessel?”

“miss jessel. you don’t believe me?” i pressed.

she turned right and left in her distress. “how can you be sure?”

this drew from me, in the state of my nerves, a flash of impatience.
“then ask flora--she’s sure!” but i had no sooner spoken than i caught
myself up. “no, for god’s sake, don’t! she’ll say she isn’t--she’ll
lie!”

mrs. grose was not too bewildered instinctively to protest. “ah, how can
you?”

“because i’m clear. flora doesn’t want me t

 she stood there looking
out i completed my statement. “that’s what flora knows.”

after a little she turned round. “the person was in black, you say?”

“in mourning--rather poor, almost shabby. but--yes--with extraordinary
beauty.” i now recognized to what i had at last, stroke by stroke,
brought the victim of my confidence, for she quite visibly weighed
this. “oh, handsome--very, very,” i insisted; “wonderfully handsome. but
infamous.”

she slowly came back to me. “miss jessel--was infamous.” she once more
took my hand in both her own, holding it as tight as if to fortify me
against the increase of alarm i might draw from this disclosure. “they
were both infamous,” she finally said.

so, for a little, we faced it once more together; and i found absolutely
a degree of help in seeing it now so straight. “i appreciate,” i said,
“the great decency of your not having hitherto spoken; but the time has
certainly come to give me the whole thing.” she appeared t

there was a way to deal with that, and i dealt; the more readily for
my full vision--on the evidence--of our employer’s late clever,
good-looking “own” man; impudent, assured, spoiled, depraved. “the
fellow was a hound.”

mrs. grose considered as if it were perhaps a little a case for a sense
of shades. “i’ve never seen one like him. he did what he wished.”

“with her?”

“with them all.”

it was as if now in my friend’s own eyes miss jessel had again appeared.
i seemed at any rate, for an instant, to see their evocation of her
as distinctly as i had seen her by the pond; and i brought out with
decision: “it must have been also what she wished!”

mrs. grose’s face signified that it had been indeed, but she said at the
same time: “poor woman--she paid for it!”

“then you do know what she died of?” i asked.

“no--i know nothing. i wanted not to know; i was glad enough i didn’t;
and i thanked heaven she was well out

nd,
at any rate, before the gray dawn admonished us to separate i had got
my answer. what my friend had had in mind proved to be immensely to the
purpose. it was neither more nor less than the circumstance that for
a period of several months quint and the boy had been perpetually
together. it was in fact the very appropriate truth that she had
ventured to criticize the propriety, to hint at the incongruity, of
so close an alliance, and even to go so far on the subject as a frank
overture to miss jessel. miss jessel had, with a most strange manner,
requested her to mind her business, and the good woman had, on this,
directly approached little miles. what she had said to him, since i
pressed, was that she liked to see young gentlemen not forget their
station.

i pressed again, of course, at this. “you reminded him that quint was
only a base menial?”

“as you might say! and it was his answer, for one thing, that was bad.”

“and for another thing?” i waited. “he repeated your words

to quint?”

“no, not that. it’s just what he wouldn’t!” she could still impress upon
me. “i was sure, at any rate,” she added, “that he didn’t. but he denied
certain occasions.”

“what occasions?”

“when they had been about together quite as if quint were his tutor--and
a very grand one--and miss jessel only for the little lady. when he had
gone off with the fellow, i mean, and spent hours with him.”

“he then prevaricated about it--he said he hadn’t?” her assent was clear
enough to cause me to add in a moment: “i see. he lied.”

“oh!” mrs. grose mumbled. this was a suggestion that it didn’t matter;
which indeed she backed up by a further remark. “you see, after all,
miss jessel didn’t mind. she didn’t forbid him.”

i considered. “did he put that to you as a justifi

 that the days passed for
me without another encounter ought, it would have appeared, to have done
something toward soothing my nerves. since the light brush, that second
night on the upper landing, of the presence of a woman at the foot of
the stair, i had seen nothing, whether in or out of the house, that one
had better not have seen. there was many a corner round which i expected
to come upon quint, and many a situation that, in a merely sinister way,
would have favored the appearance of miss jessel. the summer had turned,
the summer had gone; the autumn had dropped upon bly and had blown out
half our lights. the place, with its gray sky and withered garlands,
its bared spaces and scattered dead leaves, was like a theater after
the performance--all strewn with crumpled playbills. there were exactly
states of the air, conditions of sound and of stillness, unspeakable
impressions of the kind of ministering moment, that brought back to me,
long enough to catch it, the feeling of the medium in

be averted, my exultation would have broken
out. “they’re here, they’re here, you little wretches,” i would have
cried, “and you can’t deny it now!” the little wretches denied it with
all the added volume of their sociability and their tenderness, in just
the crystal depths of which--like the flash of a fish in a stream--the
mockery of their advantage peeped up. the shock, in truth, had sunk into
me still deeper than i knew on the night when, looking out to see either
quint or miss jessel under the stars, i had beheld the boy over
whose rest i watched and who had immediately brought in with him--had
straightway, there, turned it on me--the lovely upward look with which,
from the battlements above me, the hideous apparition of quint had
played. if it was a question of a scare, my discovery on this occasion
had scared me more than any other, and it was in the condition of nerves
produced by it that i made my actual inductions. they harassed me so

 do nothing but what she likes!’”

“i wish indeed he would. and what did flora say?”

“miss flora was too sweet. she said, ‘oh, of course, of course!’--and i
said the same.”

i thought a moment. “you were too sweet, too--i can hear you all. but
nonetheless, between miles and me, it’s now all out.”

“all out?” my companion stared. “but what, miss?”

“everything. it doesn’t matter. i’ve made up my mind. i came home, my
dear,” i went on, “for a talk with miss jessel.”

i had by this time formed the habit of having mrs. grose literally well
in hand in advance of my sounding that note; so that even now, as
she bravely blinked under the signal of my word, i could keep her
comparatively firm. “a talk! do you mean she spoke?”

“it came to that. i found her, on my return, in the schoolroom.”

“and what did she say?” i can hear the good woman still, and the candor
of her stupefaction.

“that she suffers the torments--!”

it was this, of a truth,

t from which, the other
day, we saw together what i told you.”

“when she pretended not to see--?”

“with that astounding self-possession? i’ve always been sure she wanted
to go back alone. and now her brother has managed it for her.”

mrs. grose still stood where she had stopped. “you suppose they really
talk of them?”

“i could meet this with a confidence! they say things that, if we heard
them, would simply appall us.”

“and if she is there--”

“yes?”

“then miss jessel is?”

“beyond a doubt. you shall see.”

“oh, thank you!” my friend cried, planted so firm that, taking it in, i
went straight on without her. by the time i reached the pool, however,
she was close behind me, and i knew that, whatever, to her apprehension,
might befall me, the exposure of my society struck her as her least
danger. she exhaled a moan of relief as we at last came in sight of the
greater part of the water without a sight of the child. there was no
trace of flora on that n

e finished me:
these three words from her were, in a flash like the glitter of a drawn
blade, the jostle of the cup that my hand, for weeks and weeks, had
held high and full to the brim that now, even before speaking, i felt
overflow in a deluge. “i’ll tell you if you’ll tell me--” i heard myself
say, then heard the tremor in which it broke.

“well, what?”

mrs. grose’s suspense blazed at me, but it was too late now, and i
brought the thing out handsomely. “where, my pet, is miss jessel?”

just as in the churchyard with miles, the whole thing was upon us. much
as i had made of the fact that this name had never once, between us,
been sounded, the quick, smitten glare with which the child’s face now
received it fairly likened my breach of the silence to the smash of a
pane of glass. it added to the interposing cry, as if to stay the blow,
that mrs. grose, at the same instant, uttered over my violence--the
shriek of a creature scared, or rather wounded, which, in turn

, within a
few seconds, was completed by a gasp of my own. i seized my colleague’s
arm. “she’s there, she’s there!”

miss jessel stood before us on the opposite bank exactly as she had
stood the other time, and i remember, strangely, as the first feeling
now produced in me, my thrill of joy at having brought on a proof. she
was there, and i was justified; she was there, and i was neither cruel
nor mad. she was there for poor scared mrs. grose, but she was there
most for flora; and no moment of my monstrous time was perhaps so
extraordinary as that in which i consciously threw out to her--with
the sense that, pale and rav

t--i saw--my livid
predecessor press, from her position, on my defeat, and i was conscious,
more than all, of what i should have from this instant to deal with in
the astounding little attitude of flora. into this attitude mrs. grose
immediately and violently entered, breaking, even while there pierced
through my sense of ruin a prodigious private triumph, into breathless
reassurance.

“she isn’t there, little lady, and nobody’s there--and you never see
nothing, my sweet! how can poor miss jessel--when poor miss jessel’s
dead and buried? we know, don’t we, love?”--and she appealed, blundering
in, to the child. “it’s all a mere mistake and a worry and a joke--and
we’ll go home as fast as we can!”

our companion, on this, had responded with a strange, quick primness of
propriety, and they were again, with mrs. grose on her feet, united, as
it were, in pained opposition to me. flora continued to fix me with
her small mask of reprobation, and even at that minute i prayed god t

hair. we sat there in absolute stillness; yet he
wanted, i felt, to be with me.

before a new day, in my room, had fully broken, my eyes opened to mrs.
grose, who had come to my bedside with worse news. flora was so markedly
feverish that an illness was perhaps at hand; she had passed a night of
extreme unrest, a night agitated above all by fears that had for their
subject not in the least her former, but wholly her present, governess.
it was not against the possible re-entrance of miss jessel on the scene
that she protested--it was conspicuously and passionately against mine.
i was promptly on my feet of course, and with an immense deal to ask;
the more that my friend had discernibly now girded her loins to meet me
once more. this i felt as soon as i had put to her the question of
her sense of the child’s sincerity as against my own. “she persists in
denying to you that she saw, or has ever seen, anything?”

my visitor’s trouble, truly, was great. “ah, miss, it isn’t a m

on which i can push her! yet it isn’t either, i must say, as if i much
needed to. it has made her, every inch of her, quite old.”

“oh, i see her perfectly from here. she resents, for all the world like
some high little personage, the imputation on her truthfulness and,
as it were, her respectability. ‘miss jessel indeed--she!’ ah, she’s
‘respectable,’ the chit! the impression she gave me there yesterday was,
i assure you, the very strangest of all; it was quite beyond any of the
others. i did put my foot in it! she’ll never speak to me again.”

hideous and obscure as it all was, it held mrs. grose briefly silent;
then she granted my point with a frankness which, i made sure, had more
behind it. “i think indeed, miss, she never will. she do have a grand
manner about it!”

“and that mann

t with a divination, and on the
perception that even now he only guessed, and that the window was still
to his own eyes free, i let the impulse flame up to convert the climax
of his dismay into the very proof of his liberation. “no more, no
more, no more!” i shrieked, as i tried to press him against me, to my
visitant.

“is she here?” miles panted as he caught with his sealed eyes the
direction of my words. then as his strange “she” staggered me and, with
a gasp, i echoed it, “miss jessel, miss jessel!” he with a sudden fury
gave me back.

i seized, stupefied, his supposition--some sequel to what we had done to
flora, but this made me only want to show him that it was better still
than that. “it’s not miss jessel! but it’s at the window--straight
before us. it’s there--the coward horror, there for the last time!”

at this, after a second in which his head made the movement of a baffled
dog’s on a scent and then gave a frantic little shake for air and light,
he was
