 rasped and clattered.
the brown paint on the door was so old that the naked wood showed
between the rents. he stood on the street below and knocked. there came
a heavy footstep; a large, stout woman of about sixty towered above him.
he looked up at her from the pavement. she had a rather severe face.

she admitted him into the parlour, which opened on to the street. it was
a small, stuffy, defunct room, of mahogany, and deathly enlargements of
photographs of departed people done in carbon. mrs. radford left him.
she was stately, almost martial. in a moment clara appeared. she flushed
deeply, and he was covered with confusion. it seemed as if she did not
like being discovered in her home circumstances.

â€œi thought it couldnâ€™t be your voice,â€ she said.

but she might as well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb. she invited him
out of the mausoleum of a parlour into the kitchen.

that was a little, darkish room too, but it was smothered in white lace.
the mother had seated herself again by t

ce, a little box of pins, and on
the sofa lay a heap of drawn lace.

the room was all lace, and it was so dark and warm that the white, snowy
stuff seemed the more distinct.

â€œif youâ€™re coming in you wonâ€™t have to mind the work,â€ said mrs.
radford. â€œi know weâ€™re about blocked up. but sit you down.â€

clara, much embarrassed, gave him a chair against the wall opposite the
white heaps. then she herself took her place on the sofa, shamedly.

â€œwill you drink a bottle of stout?â€ mrs. radford asked. â€œclara, get him
a bottle of stout.â€

he protested, but mrs. radford insisted.

â€œyou look as if you could do with it,â€ she said. â€œhavenâ€™t you never any
more colour than that?â€

â€œitâ€™s only a thick skin iâ€™ve got that doesnâ€™t show the blood through,â€
 he answered.

clara, ashamed and chagrined, brought him a bottle of stout and a glass.
he poured out some of the black stuff.

â€œwell,â€ he said, lifting the glass, â€œhereâ€™s health!â€

â€œand thank you,â€ said mrs

he took a drink of stout.

â€œand light yourself a cigarette, so long as you donâ€™t set the house on
fire,â€ said mrs. radford.

â€œthank you,â€ he replied.

â€œnay, you neednâ€™t thank me,â€ she answered. â€œi sâ€™ll be glad to smell a
bit of smoke in thâ€™ â€˜ouse again. a house oâ€™ women is as dead as a house
wiâ€™ no fire, to my thinkinâ€™. iâ€™m not a spider as likes a corner to
myself. i like a man about, if heâ€™s only something to snap at.â€

clara began to work. her jenny spun with a subdued buzz; the white
lace hopped from between her fingers on to the card. it was filled; she
snipped off the length, and

 clara,â€ continued the mother. â€œyouâ€™re
in jordanâ€™s, arenâ€™t you?â€ she drew her lace unceasing.

â€œyes.â€

â€œay, well, and i can remember when thomas jordan used to ask me for one
of my toffies.â€

â€œdid he?â€ laughed paul. â€œand did he get it?â€

â€œsometimes he did, sometimes he didnâ€™t--which was latterly. for heâ€™s the
sort that takes all and gives naught, he is--or used to be.â€

â€œi think heâ€™s very decent,â€ said paul.

â€œyes; well, iâ€™m glad to hear it.â€

mrs. radford looked across at him steadily. there was something
determined about her that he liked. her face was falling loose, but her
eyes were calm, and there was something strong in her that made it
seem she was not old; merely her wrinkles and loose cheeks were an
anachronism. she had the strength and sang-froid of a woman in the prime
of life. she continued drawing the lace with slow, dignified movements.
the big web came up inevitably over her apron; the length of lace fell
away at her side. her arms

our mother be gone to bed?â€ he asked.

â€œshe may be. i hope not.â€

they hurried along the silent, dark little street, the only people out
of doors. clara quickly entered the house. he hesitated.

he leaped up the step and was in the room. her mother appeared in the
inner doorway, large and hostile.

â€œwho have you got there?â€ she asked.

â€œitâ€™s mr. morel; he has missed his train. i thought we might put him up
for the night, and save him a ten-mile walk.â€

â€œhâ€™m,â€ exclaimed mrs. radford. â€œthatâ€™s your lookout! if youâ€™ve invited
him, heâ€™s very welcome as far as iâ€™m concerned. you keep the house!â€

â€œif you donâ€™t like me, iâ€™ll go away again,â€ he said.

â€œnay, nay, you neednâ€™t! come along in! i dunno what youâ€™ll think of the
supper iâ€™d got her.â€

it was a little dish of chip potatoes and a piece of bacon. the table
was roughly laid for one.

â€œyou can have some more bacon,â€ continued mrs. radford. â€œmore chips you
canâ€™t have.â€

â€œitâ€™s a shame

 to bother you,â€ he said.

â€œoh, donâ€™t you be apologetic! it doesnâ€™t do wiâ€™ me! you treated her to
the theatre, didnâ€™t you?â€ there was a sarcasm in the last question.

â€œwell?â€ laughed paul uncomfortably.

â€œwell, and whatâ€™s an inch of bacon! take your coat off.â€

the big, straight-standing woman was trying to estimate the situation.
she moved about the cupboard. clara took his coat. the room was very
warm and cosy in the lamplight.

â€œmy sirs!â€ exclaimed mrs. radford; â€œbut you twoâ€™s a pair of bright
beauties, i must say! whatâ€™s all that get-up for?â€

â€œi believe we donâ€™t know,â€ he said, feeling a victim.

â€œthere isnâ€™t room in this house for two such bobby-dazzlers, if you fly
your kites that high!â€ she rallied them. it was a nasty thrust.

he in his dinner jacket, and clara in her green dress and bare arms,
were confused. they felt they must shelter each other in that little
kitchen.

â€œand look at that blossom!â€ continued mrs. radford

to see it, donâ€™t you?â€ he asked.

the mother had them in her power. all the time his heart was beating
hard, and he was tight with anxiety. but he would fight her.

â€œme like to see it!â€ exclaimed the old woman. â€œwhat should i like to see
her make a fool of herself for?â€

â€œiâ€™ve seen people look bigger fools,â€ he said. clara was under his
protection now.

â€œoh, ay! and when was that?â€ came the sarcastic rejoinder.

â€œwhen they made frights of themselves,â€ he answered.

mrs. radford, large and threatening, stood suspended on the hearthrug,
holding her fork.

â€œtheyâ€™re fools either road,â€ she answered at length, turning to the
dutch oven.

â€œno,â€ he said, fighting stoutly. â€œfolk ought to look as well as they
can.â€

â€œand do you call that looking nice!â€ cried the mother, pointing a
scornful fork at clara. â€œthat--that looks as if it wasnâ€™t properly
dressed!â€

â€œi believe youâ€™re jealous that you canâ€™t swank as well,â€ he said
laughing.

â€œme! i coul

d have worn evening dress with anybody, if iâ€™d wanted to!â€
 came the scornful answer.

â€œand why didnâ€™t you want to?â€ he asked pertinently. â€œor did you wear
it?â€

there was a long pause. mrs. radford readjusted the bacon in the dutch
oven. his heart beat fast, for fear he had offended her.

â€œme!â€ she exclaimed at last. â€œno, i didnâ€™t! and when i was in service,
i knew as soon as one of the maids came out in bare shoulders what sort
she was, going to her sixpenny hop!â€

â€œwere you too good to go to a sixpenny hop?â€ he said.

clara sat with bowed head. his eyes were dark and glittering. mrs.
radford took the dutch oven from the fire, and stood near him, putting
bits of bacon on hi

s plate.

â€œthereâ€™s a nice crozzly bit!â€ she said.

â€œdonâ€™t give me the best!â€ he said.

â€œsheâ€™s got what she wants,â€ was the answer.

there was a sort of scornful forbearance in the womanâ€™s tone that made
paul know she was mollified.

â€œbut do have some!â€ he said to clara.

she looked up at him with her grey eyes, humiliated and lonely.

â€œno thanks!â€ she said.

â€œwhy wonâ€™t you?â€ he answered carelessly.

the blood was beating up like fire in his veins. mrs. radford sat down
again, large and impressive and aloof. he left clara altogether to
attend to the mother.

â€œthey say sarah bernhardtâ€™s fifty,â€ he said.

â€œfifty! sheâ€™s turned sixty!â€ came the scornful answer.

â€œwell,â€ he said, â€œyouâ€™d never think it! she made me want to howl even
now.â€

â€œi should like to see myself howling at that bad old baggage!â€ said
mrs. radford. â€œitâ€™s time she began to think herself a grandmother, not a
shrieking catamaran--â€

he laughed.

â€œand itâ€™s a word as i use,â€ she retorted.

â€œmy mother does sometimes, and itâ€™s no good my telling her,â€ he said.

â€œi sâ€™d think she boxes your ears,â€ said mrs. radford, good-humouredly.

â€œsheâ€™d like to, and she says she will, so i give her a little stool to
stand on.â€

â€œthatâ€™s the worst of my mother,â€ said clara. â€œshe never wants a stool
for anything.â€

â€œbut she often canâ€™t touch that lady with a long prop,â€ retorted mrs.
radford to paul.

â€œi sâ€™d think she doesnâ€™t want touching with a prop,â€ he laughed. â€œi
shouldnâ€™t.â€

â€œit might do the pair of you good to give you a crack on the head with
one,â€ said the mother, laughing

 suddenly.

â€œwhy are you so vindictive towards me?â€ he said. â€œiâ€™ve not stolen
anything from you.â€

â€œno; iâ€™ll watch that,â€ laughed the older woman.

soon the supper was finished. mrs. radford sat guard in her chair. paul
lit a cigarette. clara went upstairs, returning with a sleeping-suit,
which she spread on the fender to air.

â€œwhy, iâ€™d forgot all about them!â€ said mrs. radford. â€œwhere have they
sprung from?â€

â€œout of my drawer.â€

â€œhâ€™m! you bought â€˜em for baxter, anâ€™ he wouldnâ€™t wear â€˜em, would
he?â€--laughing. â€œsaid he reckoned to do wiâ€™out trousers iâ€™ bed.â€ she
turned confidentially to paul, saying: â€œhe couldnâ€™t bear â€˜em, them
pyjama things.â€

the young man sat making rings of smoke.

â€œwell, itâ€™s everyone to his taste,â€ he laughed.

then followed a little discussion of the merits of pyjamas.

â€œmy mother loves me in them,â

€ he said. â€œshe says iâ€™m a pierrot.â€

â€œi can imagine theyâ€™d suit you,â€ said mrs. radford.

after a while he glanced at the little clock that was ticking on the
mantelpiece. it was half-past twelve.

â€œit is funny,â€ he said, â€œbut it takes hours to settle down to sleep
after the theatre.â€

â€œitâ€™s about time you did,â€ said mrs. radford, clearing the table.

â€œare you tired?â€ he asked of clara.

â€œnot the least bit,â€ she answered, avoiding his eyes.

â€œshall we have a game at cribbage?â€ he said.

â€œiâ€™ve forgotten it.â€

â€œwell, iâ€™ll teach you again. may we play crib, mrs. radford?â€ he asked.

â€œyouâ€™ll please yourselves,â€ she said; â€œbut itâ€™s pretty late.â€

â€œa game or so will make us sleepy,â€ he answered.

clara brought the cards, and sat spinning her wedding-ring whilst he
shuffled them. mrs. ra

dford was washing up in the scullery. as it grew
later paul felt the situation getting more and more tense.

â€œfifteen two, fifteen four, fifteen six, and twoâ€™s eight--!â€

the clock struck one. still the game continued. mrs. radford had done
all the little jobs preparatory to going to bed, had locked the door
and filled the kettle. still paul went on dealing and counting. he was
obsessed by claraâ€™s arms and throat. he believed he could see where the
division was just beginning for her breasts. he could not leave her. she
watched his hands, and felt her joints melt as they moved quickly. she
was so near; it was almost as if he touched her, and yet not quite. his
mettle was roused. he hated mrs. radford. she sat on, nearly

 dropping
asleep, but determined and obstinate in her chair. paul glanced at her,
then at clara. she met his eyes, that were angry, mocking, and hard as
steel. her own answered him in shame. he knew she, at any rate, was of
his mind. he played on.

at last mrs. radford roused herself stiffly, and said:

â€œisnâ€™t it nigh on time you two was thinking oâ€™ bed?â€

paul played on without answering. he hated her sufficiently to murder
her.

â€œhalf a minute,â€ he said.

the elder woman rose and sailed stubbornly into the scullery, returning
with his candle, which she put on the mantelpiece. then she sat down
again. the hatred of her went so hot down his veins, he dropped his
cards.

â€œweâ€™ll stop, then,â€ he said, but his voice was still a challenge.

 saw his mouth shut hard. again he glanced at her. it seemed like
an agreement. she bent over the cards, coughing, to clear her throat.

â€œwell, iâ€™m glad youâ€™ve finished,â€ said mrs. radford. â€œhere, take your
thingsâ€--she thrust the warm suit in his hand--â€œand this is your candle.
your roomâ€™s over this; thereâ€™s only two, so you canâ€™t go far wrong.
well, good-night. i hope youâ€™ll rest well.â€

â€œiâ€™m sure i shall; i always do,â€ he said.

â€œyes; and so you ought at your age,â€ she replied.

he bade good-night to clara, and went. the twisting stairs of white,
scrubbed wood creaked and clanged at every step. he went doggedly. the
two doors faced each other. he went

head. his eyes hardened, and he gave way.

when, later on, he was back in bed, he wondered why she had refused to
come to him openly, so that her mother would know. at any rate, then
things would have been definite. and she could have stayed with him the
night, without having to go, as she was, to her motherâ€™s bed. it was
strange, and he could not understand it. and then almost immediately he
fell asleep.

he awoke in the morning with someone speaking to him. opening his eyes,
he saw mrs. radford, big and stately, looking down on him. she held a
cup of tea in her hand.

â€œdo you think youâ€™re going to sleep till doomsday?â€ she said.

he laughed at once.

â€œit ought only to be about five oâ€™clock,â€ he said.

â€œwell,â€ she answered, â€œitâ€™s half-past seven, whether or not. here, iâ€™ve
brought you a cup of tea.â€

he rubbed his face, pushed the tumbled hair off his forehead, and roused
himself.

â€œwhatâ€™s it so late for!â€ he grumbled.

he resented being wakened. it amused

â€œoh, dash the cup!â€ he said.

â€œyou should go to bed earlier,â€ said the woman.

he looked up at her, laughing with impudence.

â€œi went to bed before you did,â€ he said.

â€œyes, my guyney, you did!â€ she exclaimed.

â€œfancy,â€ he said, stirring his tea, â€œhaving tea brought to bed to me! my
motherâ€™ll think iâ€™m ruined for life.â€

â€œdonâ€™t she never do it?â€ asked mrs. radford.

â€œsheâ€™d as leave think of flying.â€

â€œah, i always spoilt my lot! thatâ€™s why theyâ€™ve turned out such bad
uns,â€ said the elderly woman.

â€œyouâ€™d only clara,â€ he said. â€œand mr. radfordâ€™s in heaven. so i suppose
thereâ€™s only you left to be the bad un.â€

â€œiâ€™m not bad; iâ€™m only soft,â€ she said, as she went out of the bedroom.
â€œiâ€™m only a fool, i am!â€

clara was very quiet at breakfast, but she had a sort of air of
proprietorship over him that pleased him infi

evidently fond of him. he began to talk of his painting.

â€œwhatâ€™s the good,â€ exclaimed the mother, â€œof your whittling and worrying
and twistinâ€™ and too-inâ€™ at that painting of yours? what good does it do
you, i should like to know? youâ€™d better be enjoyinâ€™ yourself.â€

â€œoh, but,â€ exclaimed paul, â€œi made over thirty guineas last year.â€

â€œdid you! well, thatâ€™s a consideration, but itâ€™s nothing to the time you
put in.â€

â€œand iâ€™ve got four pounds owing. a ma

picture of it. what shall i do when he pays me the four pounds?â€

â€œnay! you know your own uses for your money,â€ said mrs. radford.

â€œbut iâ€™m going to bust this four pounds. should we go to the seaside for
a day or two?â€

â€œwho?â€

â€œyou and clara and me.â€

â€œwhat, on your money!â€ she exclaimed, half-wrathful.

â€œwhy not?â€

â€œyou wouldnâ€™t be long in breaking your neck at a hurdle race!â€ she said.

â€œso long as i get a good run for my money! will you?â€

â€œnay; you may settle that atween you.â€

â€œand youâ€™re willing?â€ he asked, amazed and rejoicing.
