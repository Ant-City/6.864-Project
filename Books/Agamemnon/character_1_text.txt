for some gleam of escape,
some breaking of the endless chain of "evil duty." in the old order of
earth and heaven there was no such escape. each blow called for the return
blow and must do so _ad infinitum_. but, according to aeschylus, there is
a new ruler now in heaven, one who has both sinned and suffered and
thereby grown wise. he is zeus the third power, zeus the saviour, and his
gift to mankind is the ability through suffering to learn (pp. 7 f.)

at the opening of the _agamemnon_ we find clytemnestra alienated from her
husband and secretly befriended with his ancestral enemy, aigisthos. the
air is heavy and throbbing with hate; hate which is evil but has its due
cause. agamemnon, obeying the prophet calchas, when the fleet lay
storm-bound at aulis, had given his own daughter, iphigenîa, as a human
sacrifice. and if we ask how a sane man had consented to such an act, we
are told of his gradual temptation; the deadly excuse offered by ancient
superstition; and above all, the fact that he had

hat something is [greek: agan], "too
much," the condemnation of _hubris_ (pride or overgrowth) and of all
things that are in excess. _agâ_ is sometimes called "the jealousy of
god," but such a translation is not happy. it is not the jealousy, nor
even the indignation, of a personal god, but the profound repudiation and
reversal of hubris which is the very law of the cosmos. through all the
triumph of the conqueror, this _agâ_ abides.

the greatest and most human character of the whole play is clytemnestra.
she is conceived on the grand aeschylean scale, a scale which makes even
lady macbeth and beatrice cenci seem small; she is more the kinswoman of
brynhild. yet she is full not only of character, but of subtle psychology.
she is the first and leading example of that time-honoured ornament of the
tragic stage, the sympathetic, or semi-sympathetic, heroine-criminal.
aeschylus employs none of the devices of later playwrights to make her
interesting. he admits, of course, no approach to a love-scen

e; he uses no
sophisms; but he does make us see through clytemnestra's eyes and feel
through her passions. the agony of silent prayer in which, if my
conception is right, we first see her, helps to interpret her speeches
when they come; but every speech needs close study. she dare not speak
sincerely or show her real feelings until agamemnon is dead; and then she
is practically a mad woman.

for i think here that there is a point which has not been observed. it is
that clytemnestra is conceived as being really "possessed" by the daemon
of the house when she commits her crime. her statements on p. 69 are not
empty metaphor. a careful study of the scene after the murder will show
that she appears first "possessed" and almost insane with triumph, utterly
dominating the elders and leaving them no power to answer. then gradually
the unnatural force dies out from her. the deed that was first an ecstasy
of delight becomes an "affliction" (pp. 72, 76). the strength that defied

e world flags and changes into a longing for peace. she has done her
work. she has purified the house of its madness; now let her go away and
live out her life in quiet. when aigisthos appears, and the scene suddenly
becomes filled with the wrangling of common men, clytemnestra fades into a
long silence, from which she only emerges at the very end of the drama to
pray again for peace, and, strangest of all, to utter the entreaty: "let
us not stain ourselves with blood!" the splash of her husband's blood was
visible on her face at the time. had she in her trance-like state actually
forgotten, or did she, even then, not feel that particular blood to be a
stain?

to some readers it will seem a sort of irrelevance, or at least a blurring
of the dramatic edge of this trage

y; but it was a truth of which he had an intense
realization. it had become something which he must with all his strength
bring to expression before he died, not in a spirit of self-assertion or
of argument, like a discoverer, but as one devoted to something higher and
greater than himself, in the spirit of an interpreter or prophet.

servant of aigisthos.

p. 2, l. 28, women's triumph cry.]--this cry of the women recurs several
times in the play: cf. p. 26, ll. 587 ff., p. 55, l. 1234. it is
conventionally represented by "ololû"; as the cry to apollo, paian is
"i-ê," l. 146, and cassandra's sob is "ototoi" or "otototoi," p. 47.

pp. 3 f., ll. 40 ff.]--with this silent scene of clytemnestra's, compare
the long silence of cassandra below, and the silence of prometheus in that
play until his torturers have left him. see the criticism of aeschylus in
aristophanes, _frogs_, ll. 911-920, pp. 68, 69 in my translation.

p. 5, l. 104, sign of the war-way.]--i.e. an ominous sign seen by the army
as it started on its journey. in homer, iliad, ll. 305-329, it is a snake
which eats the nine young of a mother bird and then the mother, and is
turned into stone afterwards.--all through this chor

 the common greek conception of the _tritos sôtêr_--
the saviour third. first, he who sins; next, he who avenges; third, he who
saves. in vegetation worship it is the old year who has committed hubris,
the sin of pride, in summer; the winter who slays him; the new year which
shall save. in mythology the three successive rulers of heaven are given
by hesiod as ouranos, kronos, zeus (cf. _prometheus_, 965 ff.), but we
cannot tell if aeschylus accepted the hesiodic story. cf. note on l. 246,
and clytemnestra's blasphemy at l. 1387, p. 63.

thrace, nne; cf. below, l. 1418.

suggestion. she demanded the sacrifice of agamemnon's daughter, iphigenîa.
(see euripides' two plays, _iphigenia in tauris_ and _iphigenia in

sin against artemis, but in aeschylus the death of iphigenîa seems to be
merely one of t

ptance of the sign.

p. 10, l. 215, 'tis a rite of old.]--literally "it is themis." human
sacrifice had had a place in the primitive religion of greece; hence
agamemnon could not reject the demand of the soldiers as an obvious crime.
see _rise of greek epic_, pp. 150-157.

p. 11, l. 246, the third cup.]--regularly poured to zeus sôtêr, the
saviour, and accompanied by a paean or cry of joy.

p. 11, l. 256, this heart of argos, this frail tower:]--i.e. themselves.

p. 11, l. 264, glad-voiced.]--clytemnestra is in extreme suspense, as
the return of agamemnon will mean either her destruction or her
deliverance. at such a moment there must be no ill-omened word, so she
challenges fate.

p. 12, l. 276, a word within that hovereth without wings.]--i.e. a
presentiment. "winged words" are words spoken, which fly from speaker to
hearer. a 'wingless' word is unspoken. the phrase occurs in homer.

pp. 13 ff., ll. 281 ff.]--beacon speech. there is no need to inquire
curiously into the practical possibility o

f this chain of beacons. greek
tragedies do not care to be exact about this kind of detail. there may
well have been a tradition that agamemnon, like the great king of persia,
used a chain of beacons across the aegean.--note how vividly
clytemnestra's imagination is working in her excitement. she seems to see
before her every leaping light in the chain, just as in the next speech
she imagines the scene in troy almost with the intensity of a vision.

p. 14, l. 314, victory in the first as in the last.]--all are victory
beacons; the spirit of victory infects them all equally. cf. l. 854 below,
where agamemnon prays that the victory which is now with him, or in him,
may abide.

p. 15, l. 348, a woman's word.]--her hatred and fear of agamemnon

of battle, that he comes straight from the war and can speak with
knowledge." the herald is probably (though perhaps not quite consistently)
conceived as having rushed post-haste with his news.

pp. 22 ff., herald.]--the herald bursts in overcome with excitement and
delight, full of love for his home and everything he sees. a marked
contrast to agamemnon, ll. 810 ff. note that his first speech confirms all
the worst fears suggested by clytemnestra. agamemnon has committed all the
sins she prayed against, and more. the terrible lines 527 ff., "till her
gods' houses, etc.," are very like a passage in the _persae_, 811 ff.,
where exactly the same acts by the persian invaders of greece make their
future punishment inevitable.

p. 22, l. 509, pythian lord.]--apollo is often a sinister figure in
tragedy. cf. sophocles _oedipus_ , ll. 915 ff., pp. 52 ff., and the
similar scene, _electra_, 655 ff. here it is a shock to the herald to come

vivid description of the actualities of war can be better appreciated now
than it could in 1913.

p. 25, l. 577, these spoils.]--spoils purporting to come from the trojan
war were extant in greek temples in aeschylus' day and later.

p. 26, l. 595, our women's joy-cry.]--there seems to have been in argos an
old popular festival, celebrating with joy or mockery the supposed death
of a man and a woman. homer (od. iii. 309 f.) derives it from a rejoicing
by orestes over aigisthos and clytemnestra; cf. below, ll. 1316 ff., p.
59; aeschylus here and sophocles in the _electra_, from a celebration by
clytemnestra of the deaths of agamemnon and cassandra. probably it was
really some ordinary new year and old year celebration to which the poets
give a tragic touch. it seems to have had a woman's "ololugmos" in it,
perhaps uttered by men. see kaibel's note, soph. _electra_ 277-281.

p. 26, l. 612, bronze be dyed like wool.]--impossible in the literal
sense, but there is after all a way of dyin

comes a note of fear, like the fear
in shakespeare's julius caesar. he is so full of triumph and success; he
must be very careful not to provoke a fall.--victory, nike, was to the
greeks a very vivid and infectious thing. it clung to you or it deserted
you. and one who was really charged with victory, like agamemnon, was very
valuable to his friends and people. hence they made statues of victory
wingless--so that she should not fly away. see _four stages of greek
religion_, p. 138 note.

p. 36, clytemnestra.]--a wonderful speech. it seems to me that aeschylus'
imagination realized all the confused passions in clytemnestra's mind, but
that his art was not yet sufficiently developed to make them all clear and
explicit. she is in suspense; does agamemnon know her guilt or not? at
least, if she is to die, she wants to say something to justify or excuse
herself in the eyes of the world. a touch of hysteria creeps in; why could
he not have been killed in all these years? why must he rise, like some

 she recovers her calm,
explains clearly the suspicious point of orestes' absence, and heaps up
her words and gestures of welcome to an almost oriental fullness (which
agamemnon rebukes, ll. 918 ff., p. 39). again, at the end, when she finds
that for the time she is safe, her real feelings almost break out.

p. 38.]--what is the motive of the crimson tapestries? i think the
tangling robe must have been in the tradition, as the murder in the bath
certainly was. one motive, of course, is obvious: clytemnestra is tempting
agamemnon to sin or "go too far." he tries to resist, but the splendour of
an oriental homecoming seduces him and he yields. but is that enough to
account for such a curious trait in the story, and one so strongly
emphasized? we are told afterwards that clytemnestra threw over her victim
an "endless web," long and rich (p. 63), to prevent his seeing or using
his arms. and i cannot help suspecting that this endless web was the same
as the crimson pall.

p. 40, l. 945, these bound slaves.]--i.e. his shoes. the metaphor shows
the trend of his unconscious mind.

p. 41, l. 950, this princess.]--this is the first time that the attention
of the audience is drawn to cassandra. she too is one of aeschylus' silent
figures. i imagine her pale, staring in front of her, almost as if in a
trance, until terror seizes her at clytemnestra's greeting in l. 1035, p.
45.

p. 41, l. 964, the cry.]--i.e. the cry of the possessed prophetess which
rang from the inner sanctuary at delphi and was interpreted by the
priests.--the last two lines of the speech are plain in their meaning but
hard to translate. literally: "when the full, or fulfilled, man walketh
his home,--o zeus the fulfiller, fulfil my prayers."

p. 42, l. 976.]--the victim has been drawn into the house; the chorus sing
a low boding song: every audience at a greek tragedy

would expect next to
hear a death cry from within, or to see a horrified messenger rush out.
instead of which the door opens and there is clytemnestra: what does she
want? "come thou also!" one victim is not enough.--in the next scene we
must understand the cause of clytemnestra's impatience. if she stays too
long outside, some one will warn agamemnon; if she leaves cassandra, she
with her second sight will warn the chorus. if cassandra could only be got
inside all would be safe!

p. 44, l. 1022, "one there was of old."]--asklêpios, the physician,
restored hippolytus to life, and zeus blasted him for so oversetting the
laws of nature.

p. 45, l. 1040, alcmêna's son.]--heracles was made a slave to omphalê,
queen of lydia. his grumbles at his insufficient food were a

 utterance in itself is natural and characteristic, but
counsels are divided. one would like to know whether aeschylus made them
speak together confusedly, as would certainly be done on the modern stage,
or whether the stately conventions of greek tragedy preferred that each
speaker should finish his say. in any case, what happens is that after a
moment or two of confused counsel the elders determine to break into the
palace, but as they are mounting the steps the great doors are flung open
and clytemnestra confronts them, standing over the dead bodies of
agamemnon and cassandra.

the illusion intended is that the elders have entered the palace and
discovered clytemnestra. but, as the mechanical arrangements of the greek
stage were not equal to this sudden change of scene, and since also it
would, even with perfect machinery, have a tiresome interrupting effect, a
slight confusion or inconsistency is allowed. we are supposed to be inside
the house; but as a matter of fact the supposition is soon f

the play goes on without any attention to the particular place of the

p. 63, l. 1387, a prayer well sped to zeus of hell]--as the third gift or
libation was ritually given to zeus the saviour, clytemnestra
blasphemously suggests that her third and unnecessary blow was an
acceptable gift to a sort of anti-zeus, a saviour of death.

p. 65, l. 1436, aigisthos.]--at last the name is mentioned which has been
in the mind of every one!--chrysêïs was a prisoner of war, daughter of
chrysês, priest of apollo. agamemnon was made to surrender her to her
father, and from this arose his quarrel with achilles, which is the
subject of the iliad.

see introduction, pp. x ff.

p. 68, l. 1513, mourners.]--this attribution of the different speeches or
songs to different speakers is, of course, conjectural. ancient dramas
come down to us with no stage directions and very imperfect indications of
the speakers.

p, 72, l. 1579, aigisthos.]--the entry of aigisthos enlivens the scene
again after the brooding and bewildered end of the dialogue between
clytemnestra and the elders. at the same time, it seems, no doubt by
deliberate intention, to reduce it to commonplace. aigisthos' self-defence
is largely justified, but he is no hero.

p. 73, l. 1602, pleisthenês.]--apparently one of the ancestors of atreus,
but it is not clear where he comes in the genealogy. he may be identical
with pelops.

peace, yet after all "had zimri peace who slew his master?" the end of the
play leaves us waiting for the return of orestes. in the first scene of
the _libation-bearers,_ he is discovered standing by night at his father's
grave.
