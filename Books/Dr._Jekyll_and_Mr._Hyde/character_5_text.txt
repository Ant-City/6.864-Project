rson; for he was
undemonstrative at the best, and even his friendship seemed to be
founded in a similar catholicity of good-nature. it is the mark of a
modest man to accept his friendly circle ready-made from the hands
of opportunity; and that was the lawyer's way. his friends were
those of his own blood or those whom he had known the longest; his
affections, like ivy, were the growth of time, they implied no
aptness in the object. hence, no doubt, the bond that united him to
mr. richard enfield, his distant kinsman, the well-known man about
town. it was a nut to crack for many, what these two could see in
each other, or what subject they could find in common. it was
reported by those who encountered them in their sunday walks, that
they said nothing, looked singularly dull, and would hail with
obvious relief the appearance of a friend. for all that, the two men
put the greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief
jewel of each week, and not only set aside occasion

mr. enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street;
but when they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his
cane and pointed.

"did you ever remark that door?" he asked; and when his companion
had replied in the affirmative, "it is connected in my mind," added
he, "with a very odd story."

"indeed?" said mr. utterson, with a slight change of voice, "and
what was that?"

"well, it was this way," returned mr. enfield: "i was coming home
from some place at the end of the

so we all set off, the doctor, and the child's father, and our
friend and myself, and passed the rest of the night in my chambers;
and next day, when we had breakfasted, went in a body to the bank. i
gave in the check myself, and said i had every reason to believe it
was a forgery. not a bit of it. the cheque was genuine."

"tut-tut," said mr. utterson.

"i see you feel as i do," said mr. enfield. "yes, it's a bad story.
for my man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a really
damnable man; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink
of the proprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes it worse) one of
your fellows who do what they call good. black-mail, i suppose; an
honest man paying through the nose for some of the capers of his
youth. black-mail house is what i call that place with the door, in
consequence. though even that, you know, is far from explaining

from this he was recalled by mr. utterson asking rather suddenly:
"and you don't know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?"

"a likely place, isn't it?" returned mr. enfield. "but i happen to
have noticed his address; he lives in some square or other."

"and you never asked about the--place with the door?" said mr.
utterson.

"no, sir: i had a delicacy," was the reply. "i feel very strongly
about putting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the
day of judgment. you start a question, and it's like starting a
stone. you sit quietly on the top of a hill; and away the stone
goes, starting others; and presently some bland old bird (the last

make it a rule of mine: the more it looks like queer street, the

"a very good rule, too," said the lawyer.

"but i have studied the place for myself," continued mr. enfield.
"it seems scarcely a house. there is no other door, and nobody goes
in or out of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of
my adventure. there are three windows looking on the court on the
first floor; none below; the windows are always shut but they're
clean. and then there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so
somebody must live there. and yet it's not so sure; for the
buildings are so packed together about that court, that it's hard to
say where one ends and anothe

the pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then,
"enfield," said mr. utterson, "that's a good rule of yours."

"yes, i think it is," returned enfield.

"but for all that," continued the lawyer, "there's one point i want
to ask: i want to ask the name of that man who walked over the
child."

"well," said mr. enfield, "i can't see what harm it would do. it
was a man of the name of hyde."

"h'm," said mr. utterson. "what sort of a man is he to see?"

"he is not easy to describe. there is something wrong with his
appearance; something displeasing, something downright detestable. i
never saw a man i so disliked, and yet i scarce know why. he must be
deformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although
i couldn't specify the point. he's an extraordinary-looking man, and
yet i really ca

declare i can see him this moment."

mr. utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a
weight of consideration.

"you are sure he used a key?" he inquired at last.

"my dear sir..." began enfield, surprised out of himself.

"yes, i know," said utterson; "i know it must seem strange. the
fact is, if i do not ask you the name of the other party, it is
because i know it already. you see, richard, your tale has gone
home. if you have been inexact in any point, you had better correct
it."

"i think you might have warned me," returned the other, with a
touch of sullenness. "but i have been pedantically exact, as you
call it. the fellow had a key; and what's more, he has it st

the morning began to grow large. it was a
night of little ease to his toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness
and besieged by questions.

six o'clock struck on the bells of the church that was so
conveniently near to mr. utterson's dwelling, and still he was
digging at the problem. hitherto it had touched him on the
intellectual side alone; but now his imagination also was engaged,
or rather enslaved; and as he lay and tossed in the gross darkness
of the night and the curtained room, mr. enfield's tale went by

before his mind in a scroll of lighted pictures. he would be aware
of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal city; then of the figure
of a man walking swiftly; then of a child running from the doctor's;
and then these met, and that human juggernaut trod the child down
and passed on regardless of her screams. or else he would see a room
in a rich house, where his friend lay asleep, dreaming and smiling
at his dreams; and then the door of that room would be opened,

things when well examined. he might see a reason for his friend's
strange preference or bondage (call it which you please) and even
for the startling clause of the will. at least it would be a face
worth seeing: the face of a man who was without bowels of mercy: a
face which had but to show itself to raise up, in the mind of the
unimpressionable enfield, a spirit of enduring hatred.

from that time forward, mr. utterson began to haunt the door in the
by-street of shops. in the morning before office hours, at noon when
business was plenty, and time scarce, at night under the face of the
fogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or
concourse, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post.

"if he be mr. hyde," he had thought, "i shall be mr. seek."

and at last his patience was rewarded. it was a fine dry night;

himself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where he would
sometimes even sleep; he was out of spirits, he had grown very
silent, he did not read; it seemed as if he had something on his

reports, that he fell off little by little in the frequency of
his visits.

it chanced on sunday, when mr. utterson was on his usual walk
with mr. enfield, that their way lay once again through the
by-street; and that when they came in front of the door, both
stopped to gaze on it.

"well," said enfield, "that story's at an end at least. we shall
never see more of mr. hyde."

"i hope not," said utterson. "did i ever tell you that i once saw
him, and shared your feeling of repulsion?"

enfield. "and by the way, what an ass you must have thought me,

open; and sitting close beside it, taking the air with an
infinite sadness of mien, like some disconsolate prisoner,
utterson saw dr. jekyll.

"what! jekyll!" he cried. "i trust you are better."

"i am very low, utterson," replied the doctor, drearily, "very
low. it will not last long, thank god."

"you stay too much indoors," said the lawyer. "you should be out,
whipping up the circulation like mr. enfield and me. (this is my
cousin--mr. enfield--dr. jekyll.) come, now; get your hat and
take a quick turn with us."

"you are very good," sighed the other. "i should like to very
much; but no, no, no, it is quite impossible; i dare not. but
indeed, utterson, i am very glad to see you; this is really a
great pleasure; i would ask you and mr. enfield up, but the place
is really not fit."

glimpse had been sufficient, and they turned and left the court
without a word. in silence, too, they traversed the by-street;
and it was not until they had come into a neighbouring
thoroughfare, where even upon a sunday there were still some
stirrings of life, that mr. utterson at last turned and looked at
his companion. they were both pale; and there was an answering
horror in their eyes.

"god forgive us, god forgive us," said mr. utterson.

but mr. enfield only nodded his head very seriously and walked on
once more in silence.

mr. utterson was sitting by his fireside one evening after
dinner, when he was surprised to receive a visit from poole.

"bless me, poole, what brings you here?" he cried; and then

doctor ill?"

"mr. utterson," said the man, "there is something wrong."
