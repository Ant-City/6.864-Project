Minos - 
                The
king of Crete in Greek mythology, Minos is portrayed by Dante as
a giant beast who stands at the Second Circle of Hell, deciding
where the souls of sinners shall be sent for torment. Upon hearing
a given sinner's confession, Minos curls his tail around himself a
specific number of times to represent the circle of Hell to which
the soul should be consigned.
