e, she
had already begun to bubble and blister so badly that the
coffin had to be kept closed at the funeral and the women
who washed the body and dressed it for death wept for her
burned hair and wrinkled breasts as though they
themselves had been her lovers. when eva got to the
hospital they put her stretcher on the floor, so preoccupied
with the hot and bubbling flesh of the other (some of them
had never seen so extreme a burn case before) they forgot
eva, who would have bled to death except old willy fields,
the orderly, saw blood staining his just-mopped floors and
went to find out where it was coming from. recognizing eva
at once he shouted to a nurse, who came to see if the
bloody one-legged black woman was alive or dead. from
then on willy boasted that he had saved eva's life--an
indisputable fact which she herself admitted and for which
she cursed him every day for thirty-seven years thereafter
and would have cursed him for the rest of her life except by
then she was already ninety years old
