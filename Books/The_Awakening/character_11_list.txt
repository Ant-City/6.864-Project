The Two Lovers - 
                The two lovers are vacationers at the Lebrun cottages
on Grand Isle. They represent the form of young love accepted by
society. Always appearing in conjunction with the lady in black,
the lovers represent the stage of a woman's life that precedes her
maternal duties.
