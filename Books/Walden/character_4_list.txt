Amos Bronson Alcott - 
 A friend whom Thoreau refers to as "the philosopher."
Alcott was a noted educator and social reformer, as well as the
father of beloved children's author Louisa May Alcott. In 1834 he
founded the Temple School in Boston, a noted progressive school that
spawned many imitators. Affiliated with the Transcendentalists,
he was known for a set of aphorisms titled "Orphic Sayings" that
appeared in The Dial. Alcott also had a hand in
the utopian communities of Brook Farm and Fruitlands, and went on
to become the superintendent of the Concord public schools.
