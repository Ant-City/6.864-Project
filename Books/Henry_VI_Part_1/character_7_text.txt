    what you have done hath not offended me.
    nor other satisfaction do i crave
    but only, with your patience, that we may
    taste of your wine and see what cates you have,

           richard plantagenet, vernon, and another lawyer

  plantagenet. great lords and gentlemen, what means this
    silence?
    dare no man answer in a case of truth?
  suffolk. within the temple hall we were too loud;
    the garden here is more convenient.

    or else was wrangling somerset in th' error?

  warwick. between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch;
    between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth;
    between two blades, which bears the better temper;
    between two horses, which doth bear him best;
    between two girls, which hath the merriest eye
    i have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgment;
    but in these nice sharp quillets of the law,
    good faith, i am no wiser than a daw.

is a mannerly forbearance:
    the truth appears so naked on my side
    that any purblind eye may find it out.
  somerset. and on my side it is so well apparell'd,
    so clear, so shining, and so evident,
    that it will glimmer through a blind man's eye.
  plantagenet. since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,
    in dumb significants proclaim your thoughts.
    let him that is a true-born gentleman
    and stands upon the honour of his birth,
    if he suppose that i have pleaded truth,
    from off this brier pluck a white rose with me.
  somerset. let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,

  warwick. i love no colours; and, without all colour
    of base insinuating flattery,
    i pluck this white rose with plantagenet.
  suffolk. i pluck this red rose with young somerset,
    and say withal i think he held the right.
  vernon. stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more
    till you conclude that he upon whose side
    the fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree
    shall yield the other in the right opinion.

    if i have fewest, i subscribe in silence.

    lest, bleeding, you do paint the white rose red,

    opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt
    and keep me on the side where still i am.
  somerset. well, well, come on; who else?
  lawyer.  [to somerset]  unless my study and my books be
    false,
    the argument you held was wrong in you;
    in sign whereof i pluck a white rose too.
  plantagenet. now, somerset, where is your argument?
  somerset. here in my scabbard, meditating that
    shall dye your white rose in a bloody red.
  plantagenet. meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our
    roses;
    for pale they look with fear, as witnessing
    the truth on our side.
  somerset. no, plantagenet,
    'tis not for fear but anger

  plantagenet. ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth;
    whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.
  somerset. well, i'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses,
    that shall maintain what i have said is true,
    where false plantagenet dare not be seen.
  plantagenet. now, by this maiden blossom in my hand,
    i scorn thee and thy fashion, peevish boy.
  suffolk. turn not thy scorns this way, plantagenet.
  plantagenet. proud pole, i will, and scorn both him and
    thee.

    third son to the third edward, king of england.
    spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?
  plantagenet. he bears him on the place's privilege,
    or durst not for his craven heart say thus.
  somerset. by him that made me, i'll maintain my words
    on any plot of ground in christendom.
    was not thy father, richard earl of cambridge,
    for treason executed in our late king's days?
    and by his treason stand'st not thou attainted,
    corrupted, and exempt from ancient gentry?
    his trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood;
    and till thou be restor'd thou art a yeoman.

    condemn'd to die for treason, but no traitor;

  somerset. it is too late; i cannot send them now.
    this expedition was by york and talbot
    too rashly plotted; all our general force
    might with a sally of the very town
    be buckled with. the over daring talbot
    hath sullied all his gloss of former honour
    by this unheedful, desperate, wild adventure.
    york set him on to fight and die in shame.

  somerset. how now, sir william! whither were you sent?
  lucy. whither, my lord! from bought and sold lord
    talbot,
    who, ring'd about with bold adversity,
    cries out for noble york and somerset
    to beat assailing death from his weak legions;
    and whiles the honourable captain there
    drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs
    and, in advantage ling'ring, looks for rescue,
    you, his false hopes, the trust of england's honour,
    keep off aloof with worthless emulation.
    let not your private discord keep away
    the levied succours that should lend him aid,
    while he, renowned noble gentleman,
    yield up his life unto a world of odds.

  somerset. york set him on; york should have sent him aid.
  lucy. and york as fast upon your grace exclaims,
    swearing that you withhold his levied host,
    collected for this expedition.
  somerset. york lies; he might have sent and had the horse.
    i owe him little duty and less love,
    and take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending.
  lucy. the fraud of england, not the force of france,
    hath now entrapp'd the noble minded talbot.
    never to england shall he bear his life,
    but dies betray'd to fortune by your strife.
  somerset. come, go; i will dispatch the horsemen straight;
    within six hours they will be at his aid.

  talbot. o young john talbot! i did send for thee
    to tutor thee in stratagems of war,
    that talbot's name might be in thee reviv'd
    when sapless age and weak unable limbs
    should bring thy father to his drooping chair.

    poor boy! he smiles, methinks, as who should say,
    had death been french, then death had died to-day.
    come, come, and lay him in his father's arms.
    my spirit can no longer bear these harms.

  charles. had york and somerset brought rescue in,
    we should have found a bloody day of this.
  bastard. how the young whelp of talbot's, raging wood,
    did flesh his puny sword in frenchmen's blood!
  pucelle. once i encount'red him, and thus i said:
    'thou maiden youth, be vanquish'd by a maid.'
    but with a proud majestical high scorn
    he answer'd thus: 'young talbot was not born
    to be the pillage of a giglot wench.'
    so, rushing in the bowels of the french,
    he left me proudly, as unworth
