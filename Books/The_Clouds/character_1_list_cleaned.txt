[CHARACTER] - 
      the spend-thrift and arrogant son of strepsiades. he has adopted the aristocratic posturing of his mother and uncle megacles and demonstrates a passion for horses as well as a passion for esoteric knowledge. he is cocky and smug and proves a receptive pupil for the subtle rhetoric taught by socrates. he is fascinated by himself--at first, his own material needs and finally his own whirling dervish of an intellect--and his egotism makes him cruel and ruthless.
