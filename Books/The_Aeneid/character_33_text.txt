  that times to come should see the trojan race
  her carthage ruin, and her tow'rs deface;
  nor thus confin'd, the yoke of sov'reign sway
  should on the necks of all the nations lay.
  she ponder'd this, and fear'd it was in fate;
  nor could forget the war she wag'd of late
  for conqu'ring greece against the trojan state.
  besides, long causes working in her mind,
  and secret seeds of envy, lay behind;
  deep graven in her heart the doom remain'd
  of partial paris, and her form disdain'd;
  the grace bestow'd on ravish'd ganymed,
  electra's glories, and her injur'd bed.
  each was a cause alone; and all combin'd
  to kindle vengeance in her haughty mind.
  for this, far distant from the latian coast
  she drove the remnants of the trojan host;
  and sev'n long years th' unhappy wand'ring train
  were toss'd by storms, and scatter'd thro' the main.
  such time, such toil, requir'd the roman name,
  such length of labor for so vast a frame.

  then from her rosy lips began to speak:
  'my son, from whence this madness, this neglect
  of my commands, and those whom i protect?
  why this unmanly rage? recall to mind
  whom you forsake, what pledges leave behind.
  look if your helpless father yet survive,
  or if ascanius or creusa live.
  around your house the greedy grecians err;
  and these had perish'd in the nightly war,
  but for my presence and protecting care.
  not helen's face, nor paris, was in fault;
  but by the gods was this destruction brought.
  now cast your eyes around, while i dissolve
  the mists and films that mortal eyes involve,
  purge from your sight the dross, and make you see
  the shape of each avenging deity.
  enlighten'd thus, my just commands fulfil,
  nor fear obedience to your mother's will.
  where yon disorder'd heap of ruin lies,
  stones rent from stones; where clouds of dust arise-
  amid that smother neptune holds his place,

ms, and with sparkling wine,
  seest thou not this? or do we fear in vain
  thy boasted thunder, and thy thoughtless reign?
  do thy broad hands the forky lightnings lance?
  thine are the bolts, or the blind work of chance?
  a wand'ring woman builds, within our state,
  a little town, bought at an easy rate;
  she pays me homage, and my grants allow
  a narrow space of libyan lands to plow;
  yet, scorning me, by passion blindly led,
  admits a banish'd trojan to her bed!
  and now this other paris, with his train
  of conquer'd cowards, must in afric reign!
  (whom, what they are, their looks and garb confess,
  their locks with oil perfum'd, their lydian dress.)
  he takes the spoil, enjoys the princely dame;
  and i, rejected i, adore an empty name."

  his vows, in haughty terms, he thus preferr'd,
  and held his altar's horns. the mighty thund'rer heard;
  then cast his eyes on carthage, where he found
  the lustful pair in lawless pleasure drown'd,
  lost in their loves, insensible

  two prizes i propose, and thus divide:
  a bull with gilded horns, and fillets tied,

  then haughty dares in the lists appears;
  stalking he strides, his head erected bears:
  his nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield,
  and loud applauses echo thro' the field.
  dares alone in combat us'd to stand
  the match of mighty paris, hand to hand;
  the same, at hector's fun'rals, undertook
  gigantic butes, of th' amycian stock,
  and, by the stroke of his resistless hand,
  stretch'd the vast bulk upon the yellow sand.
  such dares was; and such he strode along,
  and drew the wonder of the gazing throng.
  his brawny back and ample breast he shows,
  his lifted arms around his head he throws,
  and deals in whistling air his empty blows.

  he said, and then on each bestow'd a steed.
  three hundred horses, in high stables fed,
  stood ready, shining all, and smoothly dress'd:
  of these he chose the fairest and the best,
  to mount the trojan troop. at his command
  the steeds caparison'd with purple stand,
  with golden trappings, glorious to behold,
  and champ betwixt their teeth the foaming gold.
  then to his absent guest the king decreed
  a pair of coursers born of heav'nly breed,
  who from their nostrils breath'd ethereal fire;
  whom circe stole from her celestial sire,
  by substituting mares produc'd on earth,
  whose wombs conceiv'd a more than mortal birth.
  these draw the chariot which latinus sends,
  and the rich present to the prince commends.

  at least i can defer the nuptial day,
  and with protracted wars the peace delay:
  with blood the dear alliance shall be bought,
  and both the people near destruction brought;
  so shall the son-in-law and father join,
  with ruin, war, and waste of either line.
  o fatal maid, thy marriage is endow'd
  with phrygian, latian, and rutulian blood!
  bellona leads thee to thy lover's hand;
  another queen brings forth another brand,
  to burn with foreign fires another land!
  a second paris, diff'ring but in name,
  shall fire his country with a second flame."

  thus having said, she sinks beneath the ground,
  with furious haste, and shoots the stygian sound,
  to rouse alecto from th' infernal seat
  of her dire sisters, and their dark retreat.
  this fury, fit for her intent, she chose;
  one who delights in wars and human woes.
  ev'n pluto hates his own misshapen race;
  her sister furies fly her hideous face;
  so frightful are the forms the monster takes,

  of arms, and arras, and of plate, they find
  a precious load; but these they leave behind.
  yet, fond of gaudy spoils, the boy would stay
  to make the rich caparison his prey,
  which on the steed of conquer'd rhamnes lay.
  nor did his eyes less longingly behold
  the girdle-belt, with nails of burnish'd gold.
  this present caedicus the rich bestow'd

  and, absent, join'd in hospitable ties:
  he, dying, to his heir bequeath'd the prize;

his feet fell haughty hebrus dead,
  then latagus, and palmus as he fled.
  at latagus a weighty stone he flung:
  his face was flatted, and his helmet rung.
  but palmus from behind receives his wound;
  hamstring'd he falls, and grovels on the ground:
  his crest and armor, from his body torn,
  thy shoulders, lausus, and thy head adorn.
  evas and mimas, both of troy, he slew.
  mimas his birth from fair theano drew,
  born on that fatal night, when, big with fire,
  the queen produc'd young paris to his sire:
  but paris in the phrygian fields was slain,
  unthinking mimas on the latian plain.

  and, as a savage boar, on mountains bred,
  with forest mast and fatt'ning marshes fed,
  when once he sees himself in toils inclos'd,
  by huntsmen and their eager hounds oppos'd-
  he whets his tusks, and turns, and dares the war;
  th' invaders dart their jav'lins from afar:
  all keep aloof, and safely shout around;
  but none presumes to give a nearer wound:
