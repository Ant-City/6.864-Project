 thank you.
 (the player turns and goes. ros has bent for the coin.)
 guil (moving out): come on.
 ros: i say - that was lucky.
 guil (turning): what?
 ros: it was tails.
 (he tosses the coin to guil who catches it. simultaneously - a lighting change sufficient to alter the exterior
mood into interior, but nothing violent.)
 and opelia runs on in some alarm, holding up her skirts - followed by hamlet.
 note: the resemblance between hamlet and the player is superficial but noticeable.
 (ophelia has been sewing and she holds the garment. they are both mute.
hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced, no hat upon his head, his stockings fouled, ungartered and double-gyved
to his ankle, pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other... and with a look so piteous, he takes her by the
wrist and holds her hard, then he goes to the length of his arm and with his other hand over his brow, falls to such
perusal of her face as he would draw it... at last, with a little shaking of his arm, and thri

measure. (he reflects, getting more desperate and rapid.) a hindu, a buddhist and a lion-tamer chanced to meet,
in a circus on the indo-chinese border. (he breaks out.) they're taking us for granted! well, i won't stand for it! in
future, notice will be taken. (he wheels again to face into the wings.) keep out, then! i forbid anyone to
enter! (no one comes - breathing heavily.) that's better....
 (immediately, behind him a grand procession enters, principally
claudius, gertrude, polonius and ophelia. claudius takes ros's elbow as he passes and is
immediately deep in conversation: the context is shakespeare
act iii, scene i. guil still faces front as claudius, ros, etc., pass
upstage and turn.)
 guil: death followed by eternity ... the worst of both worlds. it is a
terrible thought.
 (he turns upstage in time to take over the conversation with claudius.
gertrude and ros head downstage.)
 gertrude: did he receive you well?
 ros: most like a gentleman.
 guil (returning in time to take it up):

 this night to play before him.
 polonius: 'tis most true
 and he beseeched me to entreat your majesties
 to hear and see the matter.
 claudius: with all my heart, and it doth content me
 to hear him so inclined.
 good gentlemen, give him a further edge
 and drive his purpose into these delights.
 ros: we shall, my lord.
 claudius (leading out procession):
 sweet gertrude, leave us, too,
 for we have closely sent for hamlet hither,
 that he, as t'were by accident, may here
 affront ophelia....
 (exeunt claudius and gertrude.)
 ros (peevish): never a moment's peace! in and out, on and off, they're coming at us from all sides.
 guil: you're never satisfied.
 ros: catching us on the trot.... why can't we go by them!
 guil: what's the difference?
 ros: i'm going.
 (ros pulls his cloak round him. guil ignores him. without confidence ros heads upstage. he looks out and
comes back quickly.)
 he's coming.
 guil: what's he doing?
 ros: nothing.
 guil: he must be doing something.
 ros: wal

ething on the lines of a direct informal approach ... man to man
... straight from the shoulder.... now look here, what's it all about ... sort of thing. yes. yes, this looks like one to be
grabbed with both hands, i should say ... if i were asked.... no point in looking at a gift horse till you see the whites 
of its eyes, etcetera. (he has moved towards hamlet but his nerve fails. he returns.) we're overawed, that's our
trouble. when it comes to the point we succumb to their personality....
 (ophelia enters, with prayerbook, a religious procession of one.)
 hamlet: nymph, in thy orisons be all my sins remembered.
 (at his voice she has stopped for him, he catches her up.)
 ophelia: good my lord, how does your honour for this many a day?
 hamlet: i humbly thank you - well, well, well.
 (they disappear talking into the wing.)
 ros: it's like living in a public park!
 guil: very impressive. yes, i thought your direct informal approach was going to stop this thing dead in its
tracks there. if i

er: the king's brother and uncle to the prince.
 guil: not exactly fraternal.
 player: not exactly avuncular, as time goes on.
 (the queen returns, makes passionate action, finding the king dead. the
poisoner comes in again, attended by two others (the two in cloaks). the
poisoner seems to console with her. the dead body is carried away. the
poisoner woos the queen with gifts. she seems harsh awhile but in the end
accepts his love. end of mime, at which point, the wail of a woman in
torment and ophelia appears, wailing, closely followed by hamlet in a
hysterical state, shouting at her, circling her, both midstage.)
 hamlet: go to, i'll no more on't; it hath made me mad!
 (she falls on her knees weeping.)
 i say we will have no more marriage! (his voice drops to include the
tragedians, who have frozen.) those that are married already (he leans close to the player-queen and
poisoner, speaking with quiet edge) all but one shall live. (he smiles briefly at them without mirth, and starts

upstage, he speaks into her ear a quick clipped sentence.) to a nunnery, go.

audible. a slight silence.)
 player-king: full thirty times hath phoebus' cart - -
 (claudius enters with polonius and goes over to ophelia and lifts her
to her feet. the tragedians jump back with heads inclined.)
 claudius: love? his affections do not that way tend,
 or what he spake, though it lacked form a little,
 was not like madness. there's something
 in his soul o'er which his melancholy sits on
 brood, and i do doubt the hatch and the
 disclose will be some danger; which for to
 prevent i have in quick determination thus set
 it down: he shall with speed to england....

clapping his hands for attention.)
 player: gentlemen! (they look at him.) it doesn't seem to be coming. we are not getting it at all. (to guil.)
what did you think?
 guil: what was i supposed to think?
 player (to tragedians): you're not getting across!
 (ros had gone halfway up to ophelia; he returns.)
 ros: that didn't look like love to me.
 guil: starting from scratch again....
 player (to tragedians): it was a mess.
 ros (to guil): it's going to be chaos on the night.
 guil: keep back - we're spectators.
 player: act two! positions!
 guil: wasn't that the end?
 player: do you call that an ending? - with practically everyone on his feet? my goodness no - over your dead
body.
 guil: how am i supposed to take that?
 player: lying down. (he laughs briefly and in a second has neve
