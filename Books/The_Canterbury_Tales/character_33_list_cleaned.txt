[CHARACTER] - 
                    the
local parish clerk in the miller's tale, [CHARACTER] is a little bit
foolish and more than a little bit vain. he wears red stockings
underneath his floor-length church gown, and his leather shoes are
decorated like the fanciful stained-glass windows in a cathedral.
he curls his hair, uses breath fresheners, and fancies alisoun.
