mr.[CHARACTER] - 
 a strange, repugnant man who looks faintly pre-human.
hyde is violent and cruel, and everyone who sees him describes him
as ugly and deformed--yet no one can say exactly why. language itself
seems to fail around hyde: he is not a creature who belongs to the
rational world, the world of conscious articulation or logical grammar.
hyde is jekyll's dark side, released from the bonds of conscience
and loosed into the world by a mysterious potion.
