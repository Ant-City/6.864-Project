ery convenient. but in real life
we do not die when all that makes life bright dies to us. there is a
most busy and important round of eating, drinking, dressing, walking,
visiting, buying, selling, talking, reading, and all that makes up
what is commonly called _living_, yet to be gone through; and this yet
remained to augustine. had his wife been a whole woman, she might yet
have done something--as woman can--to mend the broken threads of life,
and weave again into a tissue of brightness. but marie st. clare could
not even see that they had been broken. as before stated, she consisted
of a fine figure, a pair of splendid eyes, and a hundred thousand
dollars; and none of these items were precisely the ones to minister to
a mind diseased.

when augustine, pale as death, was found lying on the sofa, and pleaded
sudden sick-headache as the cause of his distress, she recommended to
him to smell of hartshorn; and when the paleness and headache came on
week after week, she only said that she nev

was very liable to sick-headaches, and that it
was a very unfortunate thing for her, because he didnâ€™t enjoy going into
company with her, and it seemed odd to go so much alone, when they were
just married. augustine was glad in his heart that he had married so
undiscerning a woman; but as the glosses and civilities of the honeymoon
wore away, he discovered that a beautiful young woman, who has lived all
her life to be caressed and waited on, might prove quite a hard
mistress in domestic life. marie never had possessed much capability of
affection, or much sensibility, and the little that she had, had been
merged into a most intense and unconscious selfishness; a selfishness
the more hopeless, from its quiet obtuseness, its utter ignorance of
any claims but her own. from her infancy, she had been surrounded with
servants, who lived only to study her caprices; the idea that they had
either feelings or rights had never dawned upon her, even in distant
perspective. her father, whose only chil

jealously and scrupulously she exacts love, to the uttermost farthing.
when, therefore, st. clare began to drop off those gallantries and small
attentions which flowed at first through the habitude of courtship, he
found his sultana no way ready to resign her slave; there were abundance
of tears, poutings, and small tempests, there were discontents, pinings,
upbraidings. st. clare was good-natured and self-indulgent, and sought
to buy off with presents and flatteries; and when marie became mother to
a beautiful daughter, he really felt awakened, for a time, to something
like tenderness.

st. clareâ€™s mother had been a woman of uncommon elevation and purity of
character, and he gave to his child his motherâ€™s name, fondly fancying
that she would prove a reproduction of her image. the thing had been
remarked with petulant jealousy by his wife, and she regarded her
husbandâ€™s absorbing devotion to the child with suspicion and dislike;
all that was given to her seemed so mu

a tall, dark-eyed, sallow woman, half rose from a couch on which she was
reclining.

â€œmamma!â€ said eva, in a sort of a rapture, throwing herself on her neck,
and embracing her over and over again.

â€œthatâ€™ll do,--take care, child,--donâ€™t, you make my head ache,â€ said the
mother, after she had languidly kissed her.

st. clare came in, embraced his wife in true, orthodox, husbandly
fashion, and then presented to her his cousin. marie lifted her large
eyes on her cousin with an air of some curiosity, and received her with
languid politeness. a crowd of servants now pressed to the entry
door, and among them a middle-aged mulatto woman, of very respectable
appearance, stood foremost, in a tremor of expectation and joy, at the
door.

â€œo, thereâ€™s mammy!â€ said eva, as she flew across the room; and, throwing
herself into her arms, she kissed her repeatedly.

this woman did not tell her that she made her head ache, but, on th

â€œmaster always will have his joke,â€ said adolph, laughing. â€œiâ€™m
delighted to see master in such spirits.â€

â€œhere, tom,â€ said st. clare, beckoning.

tom entered the room. he looked wistfully on the velvet carpets, and the
before unimagined splendors of mirrors, pictures, statues, and curtains,
and, like the queen of sheba before solomon, there was no more spirit in
him. he looked afraid even to set his feet down.

â€œsee here, marie,â€ said st. clare to his wife, â€œiâ€™ve bought you a
coachman, at last, to order. i tell you, heâ€™s a regular hearse for
blackness and sobriety, and will drive you like a funeral, if you want.
open your eyes, now, and look at him. now, donâ€™t say i never think about
you when iâ€™m gone.â€

marie opened her eyes, and fixed them on tom, without rising.

â€œi know heâ€™ll get drunk,â€ she said.

â€œno, heâ€™s warranted a pious and sober article.â€

added; â€œremember what i told you.â€

adolph tripped gracefully forward, and tom, with lumbering tread, went
after.

â€œheâ€™s a perfect behemoth!â€ said marie.

â€œcome, now, marie,â€ said st. clare, seating himself on a stool beside
her sofa, â€œbe gracious, and say something pretty to a fellow.â€

â€œyouâ€™ve been gone a fortnight beyond the time,â€ said the lady, pouting.

â€œwell, you know i wrote you the reason.â€

â€œsuch a short, cold letter!â€ said the lady.

â€œdear me! the mail was just going, and it had to be that or nothing.â€

â€œthatâ€™s just the way, always,â€ said the lady; â€œalways something to make
your journeys long, and letters short.â€

it was a daguerreotype, clear and soft as an engraving, representing eva
and her father sitting hand in hand.

marie looked at it with a dissatisfied air.

â€œwhat made you sit in such an awkward position?â€ she said.

â€œwell, the position may be a matter of opinion; but what do you think of
the likeness?â€

â€œif you donâ€™t think anything of my opinion in one case, i suppose you
wouldnâ€™t in another,â€ said the lady, shutting the daguerreotype.

â€œhang the woman!â€ said st. clare, mentally; but aloud he added, â€œcome,
now, marie, what do you think of the likeness? donâ€™t be nonsensical,
now.â€

neatly, with a high red and yellow turban on her head, the recent gift
of eva, and which the child had been arranging on her head. â€œmammy,â€

and wants rest; take her to her chamber, and be sure she is made

tomâ€™s mistress and her opinions

â€œand now, marie,â€ said st. clare, â€œyour golden days are dawning. here is
our practical, business-like new england cousin, who will take the
whole budget of cares off your shoulders, and give you time to refresh
yourself, and grow young and handsome. the ceremony of delivering the
keys had better come off forthwith.â€

this remark was made at the breakfast-table, a few mornings after miss
ophelia had arrived.

â€œiâ€™m sure sheâ€™s welcome,â€ said marie, leaning her head languidly on her
hand. â€œi think

sheâ€™ll find one thing, if she does, and that is, that
itâ€™s we mistresses that are the slaves, down here.â€

â€œo, certainly, she will discover that, and a world of wholesome truths
besides, no doubt,â€ said st. clare.

â€œtalk about our keeping slaves, as if we did it for our _convenience_,â€
 said marie. â€œiâ€™m sure, if we consulted _that_, we might let them all go
at once.â€

evangeline fixed her large, serious eyes on her motherâ€™s face, with an
earnest and perplexed expression, and said, simply, â€œwhat do you keep
them for, mamma?â€

â€œi donâ€™t know, iâ€™m sure, except for a plague; they are the plague of my
life. i believe that more of my ill health is caused by them than by any
one thing; and ours, i know, are the very worst that ever anybody was
plagued with.â€

â€œo, come, mari

e, youâ€™ve got the blues, this morning,â€ said st. clare.
â€œyou know â€˜t isnâ€™t so. thereâ€™s mammy, the best creature living,--what
could you do without her?â€

â€œmammy is the best i ever knew,â€ said marie; â€œand yet mammy, now, is
selfish--dreadfully selfish; itâ€™s the fault of the whole race.â€

â€œselfishness _is_ a dreadful fault,â€ said st. clare, gravely.

â€œwell, now, thereâ€™s mammy,â€ said marie, â€œi think itâ€™s selfish of her to
sleep so sound nights; she knows i need little attentions almost every
hour, when my worst turns are on, and yet sheâ€™s so hard to wake. i
absolutely am worse, this very morning, for the efforts i had to make to
wake her last night.â€

â€œhasnâ€™t she sat up with you a good many nights, lately, mamma?â€ said
eva.

â€œhow should you know that?â€ said marie, sharply; â€œsheâ€™s been
complaining, i suppose.â€

â€œshe didnâ€™t complain; she only told me wha

t bad nights youâ€™d had,--so
many in succession.â€

â€œwhy donâ€™t you let jane or rosa take her place, a night or two,â€ said
st. clare, â€œand let her rest?â€

â€œhow can you propose it?â€ said marie. â€œst. clare, you really are
inconsiderate. so nervous as i am, the least breath disturbs me; and a
strange hand about me would drive me absolutely frantic. if mammy felt
the interest in me she ought to, sheâ€™d wake easier,--of course, she
would. iâ€™ve heard of people who had such devoted servants, but it never
was _my_ luck;â€ and marie sighed.

miss ophelia had listened to this conversation with an air of shrewd,
observant gravity; and she still kept her lips tightly compressed, as
if det

ermined fully to ascertain her longitude and position, before she
committed herself.

â€œnow, mammy has a _sort_ of goodness,â€ said marie; â€œsheâ€™s smooth and
respectful, but sheâ€™s selfish at heart. now, she never will be done
fidgeting and worrying about that husband of hers. you see, when i was
married and came to live here, of course, i had to bring her with me,
and her husband my father couldnâ€™t spare. he was a blacksmith, and, of
course, very necessary; and i thought and said, at the time, that
mammy and he had better give each other up, as it wasnâ€™t likely to
be convenient for them ever to live together again. i wis

â€œi suppose she feels the separation from them?â€

â€œwell, of course, i couldnâ€™t bring them. they were little dirty
things--i couldnâ€™t have them about; and, besides, they took up too
much of her time; but i believe that mammy has always kept up a sort of
sulkiness about this. she wonâ€™t marry anybody else; and i do believe,
now, though she knows how necessary she is to me, and how feeble my
health is, she would go back to her husband tomorrow, if she only could.
i _do_, indeed,â€ said marie; â€œthey are just so selfish, now, the best of
them.â€

â€œitâ€™s distressing to reflect upon,â€ said st. clare, dryly.

miss ophelia looked keenly at him, and saw the flush of mortification
and repressed vexation, and the sarcastic curl of the lip, as he spoke.

â€œnow, mammy has always been a pet with me,â€ said marie. â€œi wish some of
your northern servants could look at her closets of dresses,--silks and
muslins, and one real linen cambric, she has hanging there. iâ€™ve worked

he fact is, our servants are
over-indulged. i suppose it is partly our fault that they are selfish,
and act like spoiled children; but iâ€™ve talked to st. clare till i am
tired.â€

â€œand i, too,â€ said st. clare, taking up the morning paper.

eva, the beautiful eva, had stood listening to her mother, with that
expression of deep and mystic earnestness which was peculiar to her. she
walked softly round to her motherâ€™s chair, and put her arms round her
neck.

â€œwell, eva, what now?â€ said marie.

â€œmamma, couldnâ€™t i take care of you one night--just one? i know i
shouldnâ€™t make you nervous, and i shouldnâ€™t sleep. i often lie awake
nights, thinking--â€

â€œo, nonsense, child--nonsense!â€ said marie; â€œyou are such a strange
child!â€

â€œbut may i, mamma? i think,â€ she said, timidly, â€œthat mammy isnâ€™t well.
she told me her head ached all the time, lately.â€

â€œo, thatâ€™s just one of mammyâ€™s fidgets! mammy is just like all the rest
of them--makes such a fuss about ev

u encourage servants in giving way to every little
disagreeable feeling, and complaining of every little ailment, youâ€™ll
have your hands full. i never complain myself--nobody knows what i
endure. i feel it a duty to bear it quietly, and i do.â€

miss opheliaâ€™s round eyes expressed an undisguised amazement at this
peroration, which struck st. clare as so supremely ludicrous, that he
burst into a loud laugh.

â€œst. clare always laughs when i make the least allusion to my ill
health,â€ said marie, with the voice of a suffering martyr. â€œi only
hope the day wonâ€™t come when heâ€™ll remember it!â€ and marie put her
handkerchief to her eyes.

of course, there was rather a foolish silence. finally, st. clare got
up, looked at his watch, and said he had an engagement down street. eva
tripped away after him, and miss ophelia and marie remained at the table
alone.

â€œnow, thatâ€™s just like st. clare!â€ said the latter, withdrawing her
handkerchief with somewhat of a spirited flourish whe

ger in sight. â€œhe never realizes, never
can, never will, what i suffer, and have, for years. if i was one of the
complaining sort, or ever made any fuss about my ailments, there would
be some reason for it. men do get tired, naturally, of a complaining
wife. but iâ€™ve kept things to myself, and borne, and borne, till st.
clare has got in the way of thinking i can bear anything.â€

miss ophelia did not exactly know what she was expected to answer to
this.

while she was thinking what to say, marie gradually wiped away her
tears, and smoothed her plumage in a general sort of way, as a dove
might be supposed to make toilet after a shower, and began a housewifely
chat with miss ophelia, concerning cupboards, closets, linen-presses,
store-rooms, and other matters, of which the latter was, by common
understanding, to assume the direction,--giving her so many cautious
directions and charges, that a head less systematic and business-like
than miss opheliaâ€™s would have been utterly dizzied and

 confounded.

â€œand now,â€ said marie, â€œi believe iâ€™ve told you everything; so that,
when my next sick turn comes on, youâ€™ll be able to go forward entirely,
without consulting me;--only about eva,--she requires watching.â€

â€œshe seems to be a good child, very,â€ said miss ophelia; â€œi never saw a
better child.â€

â€œevaâ€™s peculiar,â€ said her mother, â€œvery. there are things about her so
singular; she isnâ€™t like me, now, a particle;â€ and marie sighed, as if
this was a truly melancholy consideration.

miss ophelia in her own heart said, â€œi hope she isnâ€™t,â€ but had prudence
enough to keep it down.

â€œeva always was disposed to be with servants; and i think that well
enough with some children. now, i always played with fatherâ€™s little
negroes--it never did me any harm. but eva somehow always seems to put
herself on an equality with every creature that comes near her. itâ€™s a
strange thing about the child. i never have been abl

e to break her of
it. st. clare, i believe, encourages her in it. the fact is, st. clare
indulges every creature under this roof but his own wife.â€

again miss ophelia sat in blank silence.

â€œnow, thereâ€™s no way with servants,â€ said marie, â€œbut to _put them
down_, and keep them down. it was always natural to me, from a child.
eva is enough to spoil a whole house-full. what she will do when she
comes to keep house herself, iâ€™m sure i donâ€™t know. i hold to being
_kind_ to servants--i always am; but you must make â€˜em _know their
place_. eva never does; thereâ€™s no getting into the childâ€™s head the
first beginning of an idea what a servantâ€™s place is! you heard her
offering to take care of me nights, to let mammy sleep!

cular in letting them have
everything that comes convenient,--anything that doesnâ€™t put one at
all out of the way, you know. mammy can make up her sleep, some time
or other; thereâ€™s no difficulty about that. sheâ€™s the sleepiest concern
that ever i saw; sewing, standing, or sitting, that creature will go to
sleep, and sleep anywhere and everywhere. no danger but mammy gets sleep
enough. but this treating servants as if they were exotic flowers, or
china vases, is really ridiculous,â€ said marie, as she plunged languidly
into the depths of a voluminous and pillowy lounge, and drew towards her
an elegant cut-glass vinaigrette.

â€œyou see,â€ she continued, in a faint and lady-like voice, like the last
dying breath of an arabian jessamine, or something equally ethereal,
â€œyou see, cousin ophelia, i donâ€™t often speak of myself. it isnâ€™t my
_habit_; â€˜t isnâ€™t agreeable to me. in fact, i havenâ€™t strength to do
it. but there are points where st. clare and i differ. st. clare never

posing her face into a grim neutrality, and drawing out of her pocket
about a yard and a quarter of stocking, which she kept as a specific
against what dr. watts asserts to be a personal habit of satan when
people have idle hands, she proceeded to knit most energetically,
shutting her lips together in a way that said, as plain as words could,
â€œyou neednâ€™t try to make me speak. i donâ€™t want anything to do with your
affairs,â€--in fact, she looked about as sympathizing as a stone lion.
but marie didnâ€™t care for that. she had got somebody to talk to, and she
felt it her duty to talk, and that was enough; and reinforcing herself
by smelling again at her vinaigrette, she went on.

â€œyou see, i brought my own property and servants into the connection,
when i married st. clare, and i am legally entitled to manage them my
own way. st. clare had his fortune and his servants, and iâ€™m well
enough content he should manage them his way; but st. clare will be

if every one of them walked over him, and i--you see how cruel it would
be to require me to make the exertion. now, you know these servants are
nothing but grown-up children.â€

â€œi donâ€™t know anything about it, and i thank the lord that i donâ€™t!â€
 said miss ophelia, shortly.

â€œwell, but you will have to know something, and know it to your cost,
if you stay here. you donâ€™t know what a provoking, stupid, careless,
unreasonable, childish, ungrateful set of wretches they are.â€

marie seemed wonderfully supported, always, when she got upon this
topic; and she now opened her eyes, and seemed quite to forget her
languor.

â€œyou donâ€™t know, and you canâ€™t, the daily, hourly trials that beset
a housekeeper from them, everywhere and every way. but itâ€™s no use to
complain to st. clare. he talks the strangest stuff. he says we have
made them what they are, and ought to bear with them. he says their
faults are all owing to us, and that it would be cruel to make the fault

unish it too. he says we shouldnâ€™t do any better, in their place;
just as if one could reason from them to us, you know.â€

â€œdonâ€™t you believe that the lord made them of one blood with us?â€ said
miss ophelia, shortly.

â€œno, indeed not i! a pretty story, truly! they are a degraded race.â€

â€œdonâ€™t you think theyâ€™ve got immortal souls?â€ said miss ophelia, with
increasing indignation.

â€œo, well,â€ said marie, yawning, â€œthat, of course--nobody doubts that.
but as to putting them on any sort of equality with us, you know, as if
we could be compared, why, itâ€™s impossible! now, st. clare really has
talked to me as if keeping mammy from her husband was like keeping me
from mine. thereâ€™s no comparing in this way. mammy couldnâ€™t have the
feelings that i should. itâ€™s a different thing altogether,--of course,
it is,--and yet st. clare pretends not to see it. and just as if mammy
could love her lit

 often show my feelings, i make it a principle to endure everything
in silence; itâ€™s a wifeâ€™s hard lot, and i bear it. but i did break out,
that time; so that he has never alluded to the subject since. but i know
by his looks, and little things that he says, that he thinks so as much
as ever; and itâ€™s so trying, so provoking!â€

miss ophelia looked very much as if she was afraid she should say
something; but she rattled away with her needles in a way that had
volumes of meaning in it, if marie could only have understood it.

â€œso, you just see,â€ she continued, â€œwhat youâ€™ve got to manage. a
household without any rule; where servants have it all their own way, do
what they please, and have what they please, except so far as i, with
my feeble health, have kept up government. i keep my cowhide about, and
sometimes i do lay it on; but the exertion is always too much for me. if
st. clare would only have this thing done as others do--â€

â€œand howâ€™s that?â€

â€œwhy, send them to

ce he is in earnest. o, thereâ€™s no trouble about st. clare; thatâ€™s
the reason heâ€™s no more feeling for me. but youâ€™ll find, when you come
to manage, that thereâ€™s no getting along without severity,--they are so
bad, so deceitful, so lazy.â€

â€œthe old tune,â€ said st. clare, sauntering in. â€œwhat an awful account
these wicked creatures will have to settle, at last, especially for
being lazy! you see, cousin,â€ said he, as he stretched himself at full
length on a lounge opposite to marie, â€œitâ€™s wholly inexcusable in them,
in the light of the example that marie and i set them,--this laziness.â€

â€œcome, now, st. clare, you are too bad!â€ said marie.

â€œam i, now? why, i thought i was talking good, quite remarkably for me.
i try to enforce your remarks, marie, always.â€

â€œyou know you meant no such thing, st. clare,â€ said marie.

â€œo, i must have been mistaken, then. thank you, my dear, for setting me
right.â€

â€œyou do really try to be provoking,â€ said marie.

â€œo, come, marie, the day is growing warm, and i have just had a long
quarrel with dolph, which has fatigued me excessively; so, pray be
agreeable, now, and let a fellow repose in the light of your smile.â€

â€œwhatâ€™s the matter about dolph?â€ said marie. â€œthat fellowâ€™s impudence
has been growing to a point that is perfectly intolerable to me. i
only wish i had the undisputed management of him a while. iâ€™d bring him
down!â€

â€œwhat you say, my dear, is marked with your usual acuteness and good
sense,â€ said st. clare. â€œas to dolph, the case is this: that he has so
long been engaged in imitating my graces and perfections, that he has,
at last, really mistaken himself for his master; and i have been obliged
to give him a little insight

 into his mistake.â€

â€œhow?â€ said marie.

â€œwhy, i was obliged to let him understand explicitly that i preferred to
keep _some_ of my clothes for my own personal wearing; also, i put his
magnificence upon an allowance of cologne-water, and actually was so
cruel as to restrict him to one dozen of my cambric handkerchiefs. dolph
was particularly huffy about it, and i had to talk to him like a father,
to bring him round.â€

â€œo! st. clare, when will you learn how to treat your servants? itâ€™s
abominable, the way you indulge them!â€

 said marie.

â€œwhy, after all, whatâ€™s the harm of the poor dogâ€™s wanting to be like
his master; and if i havenâ€™t brought him up any better than to find his
chief good in cologne and cambric handkerchiefs, why shouldnâ€™t i give
them to him?â€

â€œand why havenâ€™t you brought him up better?â€ said miss ophelia, with
blunt determination.

â€œtoo much trouble,--laziness, cousin, laziness,--which ruins more souls
than you can shake a stick at. if it werenâ€™t for laziness, i should have

piece after piece, like a man
who is trying to play himself into a good humor. after pushing the music
aside, he rose up, and said, gayly, â€œwell, now, cousin, youâ€™ve given us
a good talk and done your duty; on the whole, i think the better of you
for it. i make no manner of doubt that you threw a very diamond of truth
at me, though you see it hit me so directly in the face that it wasnâ€™t
exactly appreciated, at first.â€

â€œfor my part, i donâ€™t see any use in such sort of talk,â€ said marie.
â€œiâ€™m sure, if anybody does more for servants than we do, iâ€™d like to
know who; and it donâ€™t do â€˜em a bit good,--not a particle,--they get
worse and worse. as to talking to them, or anything like that, iâ€™m sure
i have talked till i was tired and hoarse, telling them their duty, and
all that; and iâ€™m sure they can go to church when they like, though they
donâ€™t understand a word of the sermon, more than so many pigs,--so it
isnâ€™t of any great use for them to go, as i see; but th

you havenâ€™t; i was born and bred among them, and i know.â€

miss ophelia thought she had said enough, and therefore sat silent. st.
clare whistled a tune.

â€œst. clare, i wish you wouldnâ€™t whistle,â€ said marie; â€œit makes my head
worse.â€

â€œi wonâ€™t,â€ said st. clare. â€œis there anything else you wouldnâ€™t wish me
to do?â€

â€œi wish you _would_ have some kind of sympathy for my trials; you never
have any feeling for me.â€

â€œmy dear accusing angel!â€ said st. clare.

â€œitâ€™s provoking to be talked to in that way.â€

â€œthen, how will you be talked to? iâ€™ll talk to order,--any way youâ€™ll
mention,--only to give satisfaction.â€

in his duties; for marie st. clare declared that she could not have any
smell of the horses about him when he came near her, and that he must
positively not be put to any service that would make him unpleasant to
her, as her nervous system was entirely inadequate to any trial of
that nature; one snuff of anything disagreeable being, according to her
account, quite sufficient to close the scene, and put an end to all her
earthly trials at once. tom, therefore, in his well-brushed broadcloth

affection, and facility of forgiveness. in all these they will exhibit
the highest form of the peculiarly _christian life_, and, perhaps, as
god chasteneth whom he loveth, he hath chosen poor africa in the furnace
of affliction, to make her the highest and noblest in that kingdom which
he will set up, when every other kingdom has been tried, and failed; for
the first shall be last, and the last first.

was this what marie st. clare was thinking of, as she stood, gorgeously
dressed, on the verandah, on sunday morning, clasping a diamond bracelet
on her slender wrist? most likely it was. or, if it wasnâ€™t that, it was
something else; for marie patronized good things, and she was going now,
in full force,--diamonds, silk, and lace, and jewels, and all,--to a
fashionable church, to be very religious. marie always made a point to
be very pious on sundays. there she stood, so slender, so elegant, so

it was not that she had not as handsome a silk dress and shawl, and
as fine a pocket-handkerchief; but stiffness and squareness, and
bolt-uprightness, enveloped her with as indefinite yet appreciable
a presence as did grace her elegant neighbor; not the grace of god,
however,--that is quite another thing!

â€œwhereâ€™s eva?â€ said marie.

â€œthe child stopped on the stairs, to say something to mammy.â€

and what was eva saying to mammy on the stairs? listen, reader, and you
will hear, though marie does not.

â€œdear mammy, i know your head is aching dreadfully.â€

â€œlord bless you, miss eva! my head allers aches lately. you donâ€™t need
to worry.â€

â€œwell, iâ€™m glad youâ€™re going out; and here,â€--and the little girl threw
her arms around her,--â€œmammy, you shall take my vinaigrette.â€

â€œwhy not? you need it, and i donâ€™t. mamma always uses it for headache,
and itâ€™ll make you feel better. no, you shall take it, to please me,
now.â€

â€œdo hear the darlin talk!â€ said mammy, as eva thrust it into her bosom,
and kissing her, ran down stairs to her mother.

â€œwhat were you stopping for?â€

â€œi was just stopping to give mammy my vinaigrette, to take to church
with her.â€

â€œevaâ€ said marie, stamping impatiently,--â€œyour gold vinaigrette to
_mammy!_ when will you learn whatâ€™s _proper_? go right and take it back
this moment!â€

eva looked downcast and aggrieved, and turned slowly.

â€œi say, marie, let the child alone; she shall do as she pleases,â€ said
st. clare.

â€œst. clare, how will she ever get along in the world?â€ said marie.

â€œthe lord knows,â€ said st. clare, â€œbut sheâ€™ll get along in heaven better
than you or i.â€

â€œi do wish st. clare ever would go to church,â€ said marie; â€œbut he
hasnâ€™t a particle of religion about him. it really isnâ€™t respectable.â€

â€œi know it,â€ said st. clare. â€œyou ladies go to church to learn how to
get along in the world, i suppose, and your piety sheds respectability
on us. if i did go at all, i would go where mammy goes; thereâ€™s
something to keep a fellow awake there, at least.â€

â€œyou see, evangeline,â€ said her mother, â€œitâ€™s always right and proper
to be kind to servants, but it isnâ€™t proper to treat them _just_ as we
would our relations, or people in our own class of life. now, if mammy
was sick, you wouldnâ€™t want to put her in your own bed.â€

â€œi should feel just like it, mamma,â€ said eva, â€œbecause then it would
be handier to take care of her, and because, you know, my bed is better
than hers.â€

marie was in utter despair at the entire want of moral perception
evinced in this reply.

â€œwhat can i do to make this child understand me?â€ she said.

â€œnothing,â€ said miss ophelia, significantly.

eva looked sorry and disconcerted for a moment; but children, luckily,
do not keep to one impression long, and in a few moments she was merrily
laughing at various things which she saw from the coach-windows, as it
rattled along.

â€œo, dr. g---- preached a splendid sermon,â€ said marie. â€œit was just such
a sermon as you ought to hear; it expressed all my views exactly.â€

â€œit must have been very improving,â€ said st. clare. â€œthe subject must
have been an extensive one.â€

â€œwell, i mean all my views about society, and such things,â€ said marie.
â€œthe text was, â€˜he hath made everything beautiful in its season;â€™ and he
showed how all the orders and distinctions in society came from god; and
that it was so appropriate, you know, and beautiful, that some should
be high and some low, and that some were born to rule and some to serve,
and all that, you know; and he applied it so well to all this ridiculous
fuss that is made about slavery, and he proved distinctly that the bible
was on our side, and supported all our institutions so co

of such subjects donâ€™t edify me much. if i was to say anything on this
slavery matter, i would say out, fair and square, â€˜weâ€™re in for it;
weâ€™ve got â€˜em, and mean to keep â€˜em,--itâ€™s for our convenience and our
interest;â€™ for thatâ€™s the long and short of it,--thatâ€™s just the whole
of what all this sanctified stuff amounts to, after all; and i think
that it will be intelligible to everybody, everywhere.â€

â€œi do think, augustine, you are so irreverent!â€ said marie. â€œi think
itâ€™s shocking to hear you talk.â€

â€œshocking! itâ€™s the truth. this religious talk on such matters,--why
donâ€™t they carry it a little further, and show the beauty, in its
season, of a fellowâ€™s taking a glass too much, and sitting a little too
late over his cards, and various providential arrangements of that sort,
which are pretty frequent among us young men;--weâ€™d like to hear that
those are right and godly, too.â€

youâ€™ll be at me with half a dozen others, each one harder than the last;
and iâ€™m not a going to define my position. i am one of the sort that
lives by throwing stones at other peopleâ€™s glass houses, but i never
mean to put up one for them to stone.â€

â€œthatâ€™s just the way heâ€™s always talking,â€ said marie; â€œyou canâ€™t get
any satisfaction out of him. i believe itâ€™s just because he donâ€™t like
religion, that heâ€™s always running out in this way heâ€™s been doing.â€

â€œreligion!â€ said st. clare, in a tone that made both ladies look at him.

and turn, and descend and ascend, to fit every crooked phase of selfish,
worldly society, religion? is that religion which is less scrupulous,

drug in the market, donâ€™t you think we should soon have another version
of the scripture doctrine? what a flood of light would pour into the

everything in the bible and reason went the other way!â€

up in vermont, or to have a house-full of servants, as we do?â€

â€œo, of course, our way is the pleasantest,â€ said eva.

â€œwhy so?â€ said st. clare, stroking her head.

â€œwhy, it makes so many more round you to love, you know,â€ said eva,
looking up earnestly.

â€œnow, thatâ€™s just like eva,â€ said marie; â€œjust one of her odd speeches.â€

â€œis it an odd speech, papa?â€ said eva, whisperingly, as she got upon his
knee.

â€œrather, as this world goes, pussy,â€ said st. clare. â€œbut where has my

â€œtom isnâ€™t a bad hand, now, at explaining scripture, iâ€™ll dare swear,â€

such a housekeeper was mrs. shelby, whom we have already described; and
such our readers may remember to have met with. if they are not common
at the south, it is because they are not common in the world. they are
to be found there as often as anywhere; and, when existing, find in
that peculiar state of society a brilliant opportunity to exhibit their
domestic talent.

such a housekeeper marie st. clare was not, nor her mother before her.
indolent and childish, unsystematic and improvident, it was not to be
expected that servants trained under her care should not be so likewise;
and she had very justly described to miss ophelia the state of confusion
she would find in the family, though she had not ascribed it to the
proper cause.

the first morning of her regency, miss ophelia was up at four oâ€™clock;

erratic, to the last degree.

like a certain class of modern philosophers, dinah perfectly scorned
logic and reason in every shape, and always took refuge in intuitive
certainty; and here she was perfectly impregnable. no possible amount of
talent, or authority, or explanation, could ever make her believe
that any other way was better than her own, or that the course she had
pursued in the smallest matter could be in the least modified. this had
been a conceded point with her old mistress, marieâ€™s mother; and â€œmiss
marie,â€ as dinah always called her young mistress, even after her
marriage, found it easier to submit than contend; and so dinah had ruled
supreme. this was the easier, in that she was perfect mistress of that
diplomatic art which unites the utmost subservience of manner with the
utmost inflexibility as to measure.

dinah was mistress of the whole art and mystery of excuse-making, in all
its branches. indeed, it was an axiom with her that the cook can do no
wrong; and

over her habitual respect of manner; â€œwhat does ladies know â€˜bout work,

while miss ophelia piled and sorted dishes, emptied dozens of scattering
bowls of sugar into one receptacle, sorted napkins, table-cloths, and
towels, for washing; washing, wiping, and arranging with her own hands,
and with a speed and alacrity which perfectly amazed dinah.

augustine laughed immoderately at the grave and anxious face with which
miss ophelia propounded the question.

â€œo, cousin, thatâ€™s too good,--_honest!_--as if thatâ€™s a thing to be
expected! honest!--why, of course, they arnâ€™t. why should they be? what
upon earth is to make them so?â€

â€œwhy donâ€™t you instruct?â€

â€œinstruct! o, fiddlestick! what instructing do you think i should do?
i look like it! as to marie, she has spirit enough, to be sure, to kill
off a whole plantation, if iâ€™d let her manage; but she wouldnâ€™t get the
cheatery out of them.â€

â€œare there no honest ones?â€

â€œwell, now and then one, whom nature makes so impracticably simple,

 she said, coquettishly tossing her head at adolph.

it must be observed that, among other appropriations from his masterâ€™s
stock, adolph was in the habit of adopting his name and address; and
that the style under which he moved, among the colored circles of new
orleans, was that of _mr. st. clare_.

â€œiâ€™m certainly of your opinion, miss benoir,â€ said adolph.

benoir was the name of marie st. clareâ€™s family, and jane was one of her
servants.

at table, marie alluded to the incident of prue. â€œi suppose youâ€™ll

â€œi think thatâ€™s a barbarous thing,â€ said miss ophelia, â€œbut i donâ€™t

â€œwell, now,â€ said marie, â€œi know itâ€™s impossible to get along with some
of these creatures. they are so bad they ought not to live. i donâ€™t feel

it would not happen.â€

and died in the swamp. there was no sort of reason for it, for fatherâ€™s
hands were always treated kindly.â€

â€œi broke a fellow in, once,â€ said st. clare, â€œthat all the overseers and

he appeared to have the rude instinct of freedom in him to an uncommon
degree. he was a regular african lion. they called him scipio. nobody
could do anything with him; and he was sold round from overseer to
overseer, till at last alfred bought him, because he thought he could

the flush of success; but i persisted in my bargain, and alfred sold him
to me. well, i took him in hand, and in one fortnight i had him tamed
down as submissive and tractable as heart could desire.â€

â€œwhat in the world did you do to him?â€ said marie.

â€œwell, it was quite a simple process. i took him to my own room, had a
good bed made for him, dressed his wounds, and tended him myself, until
he got fairly on his feet again. and, in process of time, i had free
papers made out for him, and told him he might go where he liked.â€

â€œand did he go?â€ said miss ophelia.

to leave me. i never had a braver, better fellow,--trusty and true as

was universally agreed, among all the household, from dinah down to the
youngest urchin, that miss ophelia was decidedly â€œcuris,â€--a term by
which a southern servant implies that his or her betters donâ€™t exactly
suit them.

the higher circle in the family--to wit, adolph, jane and rosa--agreed
that she was no lady; ladies never keep working about as she did,--that
she had no _air_ at all; and they were surprised that she should be any
relation of the st. clares. even marie declared that it was absolutely
fatiguing to see cousin ophelia always so busy. and, in fact, miss
opheliaâ€™s industry was so incessant as to lay some foundation for the
complaint. she sewed and stitched away, from daylight till dark, with
the energy of one who is pressed on by some immediate urgency; and then,
when the light faded, and the work was folded away, with one turn out
came the ever-ready knitting-work, and there she was again, going on as
briskly as ever. it really was a labor to s

marie was busy, turning over the contents of a drawer, as she answered,

â€œwell, of course, by and by, eva, you will have other things to think

marie always had a headache on hand for any conversation that did not
exactly suit her.

eva stole away; but after that, she assiduously gave mammy reading

about this time, st. clareâ€™s brother alfred, with his eldest son, a boy

brothers. nature, instead of instituting resemblances between them, had
made them opposites on every point;

foreshadowings


two days after this, alfred st. clare and augustine parted; and eva, who
had been stimulated, by the society of her young cousin, to exertions
beyond her strength, began to fail rapidly. st. clare was at last
willing to call in medical advice,--a thing from which he had always
shrunk, because it was the admission of an unwelcome truth.

but, for a day or two, eva was so unwell as to be confined to the house;
and the doctor was called.

marie st. clare had taken no notice of the childâ€™s gradually decaying
health and strength, because she was completely absorbed in studying out
two or three new forms of disease to which she believed she herself was
a victim. it was the first principle of marieâ€™s belief that nobody ever
was or could be so great a sufferer as _herself_; and, therefore, she
always repelled quite indignantly any suggestion that any one around her
could be sick. she was always sure, in such a case, that it was nothing

â€œlaw! iâ€™ve had that, years and years; itâ€™s only a nervous affection.â€

clothes will be wringing wet. there wonâ€™t be a dry thread in my
night-clothes and the sheets will be so that mammy has to hang them up
to dry! eva doesnâ€™t sweat anything like that!â€

miss ophelia shut her mouth for a season. but, now that eva was fairly
and visibly prostrated, and a doctor called, marie, all on a sudden,
took a new turn.

â€œshe knew it,â€ she said; â€œshe always felt it, that she was destined
to be the most miserable of mothers. here she was, with her wretched
health, and her only darling child going down to the grave before her
eyes;â€--and marie routed up mammy nights, and rumpussed and scolded,
with more energy than ever, all day, on the strength of this new misery.

â€œmy dear marie, donâ€™t talk so!â€ said st. clare. â€œyou ought not to give up
the case so, at once.â€

mercy if people havenâ€™t sensitive feelings, in this world. i am sure i

i _could_ be as easy as the rest of you!â€

and the â€œrest of themâ€ had good reason to breathe the same prayer, for
marie paraded her new misery as the reason and apology for all sorts
of inflictions on every one about her. every word that was spoken by
anybody, everything that was done or was not done everywhere, was only
a new proof that she was surrounded by hard-hearted, insensible beings,
who were unmindful of her peculiar sorrows. poor eva heard some of these
speeches; and nearly cried her little eyes out, in pity for her mamma,
and in sorrow that she should make her so much distress.

we can think _much_, very much, in a moment. st. clare saw and felt many
things, but spoke nothing; and, as it grew darker, he took his child
to her bed-room; and, when she was prepared for rest; he sent away the
attendants, and rocked her in his arms, and sung to her till she was
asleep.



chapter xxv

the little evangelist

it was sunday afternoon. st. clare was stretched on a bamboo lounge in
the verandah, solacing himself with a cigar. marie lay reclined on a
sofa, opposite the window opening on the verandah, closely secluded,
under an awning of transparent gauze, from the outrages of the
mosquitos, and languidly holding in her hand an elegantly bound
prayer-book. she was holding it because it was sunday, and she imagined
she had been reading it,--though, in fact, she had been only taking a
succession of short naps, with it open in her hand.

miss ophelia, who, after some rummaging, had hunted up a small methodist
meeting within ri

ding distance, had gone out, with tom as driver, to
attend it; and eva had accompanied them.

â€œi say, augustine,â€ said marie after dozing a while, â€œi must send to the
city after my old doctor posey; iâ€™m sure iâ€™ve got the complaint of the
heart.â€

â€œwell; why need you send for him? this doctor that attends eva seems
skilful.â€

â€œi would not trust him in a critical case,â€ said marie; â€œand i think
i may say mine is becoming so! iâ€™ve been thinking of it, these two
or three nights past; i have such distressing pains, and such strange
feelings.â€

â€œo, marie, you are blue; i donâ€™t believe itâ€™s heart complaint.â€

â€œi dare say _you_ donâ€™t,â€ said marie; â€œi was prepared to expect _that_.
you can be alarmed enough, if eva coughs, or has the least thing the
matter with her; but you never think of me.â€

â€œif itâ€™s particularly agreeable to you to have heart dis

ease, why, iâ€™ll
try and maintain you have it,â€ said st. clare; â€œi didnâ€™t know it was.â€

â€œwell, i only hope you wonâ€™t be sorry for this, when itâ€™s too late!â€
 said marie; â€œbut, believe it or not, my distress about eva, and the
exertions i have made with that dear child, have developed what i have
long suspected.â€

what the _exertions_ were which marie referred to, it would have been
difficult to state. st. clare quietly made this commentary to himself,
and went on smoking, like a hard-hearted wretch of a man as he was,
till a carriage drove up before the verandah, and eva and miss ophelia
alighted.

miss ophelia marched straight to her own chamber, to put away her bonnet
and shawl, as was always her manner, before she spoke a word on any
subject; while eva came, at st. clareâ€™s call, and was sitting on his
knee, giving him an account of the

 â€œi _will_ tell your master!â€

â€œwhatâ€™s the case now?â€ asked augustine.

â€œthe case is, that i cannot be plagued with this child, any longer! itâ€™s
past all bearing; flesh and blood cannot endure it! here, i locked her
up, and gave her a hymn to study; and what does she do, but spy
out where i put my key, and has gone to my bureau, and got a
bonnet-trimming, and cut it all to pieces to make dollsâ€™ jackets! i never
saw anything like it, in my life!â€

â€œi told you, cousin,â€ said marie, â€œthat youâ€™d find out that these
creatures canâ€™t be brought up without severity. if i had _my_ way, now,â€
 she said, looking reproachfully at st. clare, â€œiâ€™d send that child out,
and have her thoroughly whipped; iâ€™d have her whipped till she couldnâ€™t
stand!â€

â€œi donâ€™t doubt it,â€ said st. clare. â€œtell me of the lovely rule of
woman! i never saw above a dozen women that wouldnâ€™t half kill a horse,
or a servant, either, if they had their own way with them!--let alone a

man.â€

â€œthere is no use in this shilly-shally way of yours, st. clare!â€ said
marie. â€œcousin is a woman of sense, and she sees it now, as plain as i
do.â€

miss ophelia had just the capability of indignation that belongs to the
thorough-paced housekeeper, and this had been pretty actively roused
by the artifice and wastefulness of the child; in fact, many of my
lady readers must own that they should have felt just so in her
circumstances; but marieâ€™s words went beyond her, and she felt less
heat.

â€œi wouldnâ€™t have the child treated so, for the world,â€ she said; â€œbut,
i am sure, augustine, i donâ€™t know what to do. iâ€™ve taught and taught;
iâ€™ve talked till iâ€™m tired; iâ€™ve whipped her; iâ€™ve punished her in every
way i can think of, and sheâ€™s just what she was at first.â€

â€œcome here, tops, you monkey!â€ said st. clare, calling the child up to
him.

topsy came up; her round, hard eyes glittering and blinking with a

it was rather a singular one,--a brilliant scarlet geranium, and one
single white japonica, with its glossy leaves. it was tied up with an
evident eye to the contrast of color, and the arrangement of every leaf
had carefully been studied.

topsy looked pleased, as eva said,--â€œtopsy, you arrange flowers very
prettily. here,â€ she said, â€œis this vase i havenâ€™t any flowers for. i
wish youâ€™d arrange something every day for it.â€

â€œwell, thatâ€™s odd!â€ said marie. â€œwhat in the world do you want that
for?â€

â€œnever mind, mamma; youâ€™d as lief as not topsy should do it,--had you
not?â€

â€œof course, anything you please, dear! topsy, you hear your young
mistress;--see that you mind.â€

topsy made a short courtesy, and looked down; and, as she turned away,
eva saw a tear roll down her dark cheek.

â€œyou see, mamma, i knew poor topsy wanted to do something for me,â€ said
eva to her mother.

â€œo, nonsense! itâ€™s only because she likes to do misch

mustnâ€™t pick flowers,--so she does it; thatâ€™s all there is to it. but,
if you fancy to have her pluck them, so be it.â€

â€œmamma, i think topsy is different from what she used to be; sheâ€™s
trying to be a good girl.â€

â€œsheâ€™ll have to try a good while before _she_ gets to be good,â€ said
marie, with a careless laugh.

â€œwell, you know, mamma, poor topsy! everything has always been against
her.â€

â€œnot since sheâ€™s been here, iâ€™m sure. if she hasnâ€™t been talked to, and
preached to, and every earthly thing done that anybody could do;--and
sheâ€™s just so ugly, and always will be; you canâ€™t make anything of the
creature!â€

â€œbut, mamma, itâ€™s so different to be brought up as iâ€™ve been, with
so many friends, so many things to make me good and happy; and to be

â€œmost likely,â€ said marie, yawning,--â€œdear me, how hot it is!â€

â€œmamma, you believe, donâ€™t you, that topsy could become an angel, as
well as any of us, if she were a christian?â€

â€œtopsy! what a ridiculous idea! nobody but you would ever think of it. i
suppose she could, though.â€

â€œbut, mamma, isnâ€™t god her father, as much as ours? isnâ€™t jesus her
saviour?â€

â€œwell, that may be. i suppose god made everybody,â€ said marie. â€œwhere is
my smelling-bottle?â€

â€œitâ€™s such a pity,--oh! _such_ a pit

distant lake, and speaking half to herself.

â€œwhatâ€™s a pity?â€ said marie.

â€œwhy, that any one, who could be a bright angel, and live with angels,
should go all down, down down, and nobody help them!--oh dear!â€

â€œwell, we canâ€™t help it; itâ€™s no use worrying, eva! i donâ€™t know whatâ€™s
to be done; we ought to be thankful for our own advantages.â€

â€œi hardly can be,â€ said eva, â€œiâ€™m so sorry to think of poor folks that
havenâ€™t any.â€

â€œthatâ€™s odd enough,â€ said marie;--â€œiâ€™m sure my religion makes me
thankful for my advantages.â€

â€œmam

ma,â€ said eva, â€œi want to have some of my hair cut off,--a good deal
of it.â€

â€œwhat for?â€ said marie.

â€œmamma, i want to give some away to my friends, while i am able to give
it to them myself. wonâ€™t you ask aunty to come and cut it for me?â€

marie raised her voice, and called miss ophelia, from the other room.

the child half rose from her pillow as she came in, and, shaking down
her long golden-brown curls, said, rather playfully, â€œcome aunty, shear
the sheep!â€

â€œwhatâ€™s that?â€ said st. clare, who just then entered with some fruit he
had been out to get for her.

â€œpapa, i just want aunty to cut off some of my hair;--thereâ€™s too much
of it, and it makes my head hot. besides, i want to give some of it
away.â€

miss ophelia c

her father.

â€œonly because it is _true_, papa: and, if you will believe it now,
perhaps you will get to feel about it as i do.â€

st. clare closed his lips, and stood gloomily eying the long, beautiful
curls, which, as they were separated from the childâ€™s head, were laid,
one by one, in her lap. she raised them up, looked earnestly at them,
twined them around her thin fingers, and looked from time to time,
anxiously at her father.

â€œitâ€™s just what iâ€™ve been foreboding!â€ said marie; â€œitâ€™s just what has
been preying on my health, from day to day, bringing me downward to the
grave, though nobody regards it. i have seen this, long. st. clare, you
will see, after a while, that i was right.â€

â€œwhich will afford you great consolation, no doubt!â€ said st. clare, in
a dry, bitter tone.

marie lay back on a lounge, and covered her face with her cambric
handkerchief.

evaâ€™s clear blue eye looked earnestly from one to the other. it was the
calm, comprehending gaze of a s
 
 ___________________________
 
spatched a messenger, and soon the whole of the servants
were convened in the room.

eva lay back on her pillows; her hair hanging loosely about her face,
her crimson cheeks contrasting painfully with the intense whiteness of
her complexion and the thin contour of her limbs and features, and her
large, soul-like eyes fixed earnestly on every one.

the servants were struck with a sudden emotion. the spiritual face, the
long locks of hair cut off and lying by her, her fatherâ€™s averted face,
and marieâ€™s sobs, struck at once upon the feelings of a sensitive and
impressible race; and, as they came in, they looked one on another,
sighed, and shook their heads. there was a deep silence, like that of a
funeral.

eva raised herself, and looked long and earnestly round at every one.
all looked sad and apprehensive. many of the women hid their faces in
their aprons.

â€œi sent for you all, my dear friends,â€ said eva, â€œbecause i love you.
i love you all; and i have something to say to you, whic
 
 ___________________________
 
must not feel so!â€ and the child sobbed and wept with
a violence which alarmed them all, and turned her fatherâ€™s thoughts at
once to another channel.

â€œthere, eva,--there, dearest! hush! hush! i was wrong; i was wicked. i
will feel any way, do any way,--only donâ€™t distress yourself; donâ€™t sob
so. i will be resigned; i was wicked to speak as i did.â€

eva soon lay like a wearied dove in her fatherâ€™s arms; and he, bending
over her, soothed her by every tender word he could think of.

marie rose and threw herself out of the apartment into her own, when she
fell into violent hysterics.

â€œyou didnâ€™t give me a curl, eva,â€ said her father, smiling sadly.

â€œthey are all yours, papa,â€ said she, smiling--â€œyours and mammaâ€™s; and
you must give dear aunty as many as she wants. i only gave them to our
poor people myself, because you know, papa, they might be forgotten when
i am gone, and because i hoped it might help them remember. . . . you
are a christian, are you not, papa?â
 
 ___________________________
 
!â€ said her father.

â€œwell, papa, you can do everything, and are everything to me. you read
to me,--you sit up nights,--and tom has only this one thing, and his
singing; and i know, too, he does it easier than you can. he carries me
so strong!â€

the desire to do something was not confined to tom. every servant in the
establishment showed the same feeling, and in their way did what they
could.

poor mammyâ€™s heart yearned towards her darling; but she found no
opportunity, night or day, as marie declared that the state of her mind
was such, it was impossible for her to rest; and, of course, it was
against her principles to let any one else rest. twenty times in a
night, mammy would be roused to rub her feet, to bathe her head, to find
her pocket-handkerchief, to see what the noise was in evaâ€™s room, to let
down a curtain because it was too light, or to put it up because it was
too dark; and, in the daytime, when she longed to have some share in the
nursing of her pet, marie seemed un

astly imprint,--only
a high and almost sublime expression,--the overshadowing presence of
spiritual natures, the dawning of immortal life in that childish soul.

they stood there so still, gazing upon her, that even the ticking of the
watch seemed too loud. in a few moments, tom returned, with the doctor.
he entered, gave one look, and stood silent as the rest.

â€œwhen did this change take place?â€ said he, in a low whisper, to miss
ophelia.

â€œabout the turn of the night,â€ was the reply.

marie, roused by the entrance of the doctor, appeared, hurriedly, from
the next room.

â€œaugustine! cousin!--o!--what!â€ she hurriedly began.

â€œhush!â€ said st. clare, hoarsely; _â€œshe is dying!â€_

mammy heard the words, and flew to awaken the servants. the house was
soon roused,--lights were seen, footsteps heard, anxious faces thronged
the verandah, and looked tearfully through the glass doors; but st.
clare heard and said nothing,--he saw only _that look_ on the face of
the little sleeper.

 words, â€œi am the resurrection and
the life; he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he
live;â€ and, as the earth was cast in and filled up the little grave,
he could not realize that it was his eva that they were hiding from his
sight.

nor was it!--not eva, but only the frail seed of that bright, immortal
form with which she shall yet come forth, in the day of the lord jesus!

and then all were gone, and the mourners went back to the place which
should know her no more; and marieâ€™s room was darkened, and she lay on
the bed, sobbing and moaning in uncontrollable grief, and calling every
moment for the attentions of all her servants. of course, they had no
time to cry,--why should they? the grief was _her_ grief, and she was
fully convinced that nobody on earth did, could, or would feel it as she
did.

â€œst. clare did not shed a tear,â€ she said; â€œhe didnâ€™t sympathize with
her; it was perfectly wonderful to think how hard-hearted and unfeeling
he was, when he must
 
 ___________________________
 
 know how she suffered.â€

so much are people the slave of their eye and ear, that many of the
servants really thought that missis was the principal sufferer in the
case, especially as marie began to have hysterical spasms, and sent for
the doctor, and at last declared herself dying; and, in the running and
scampering, and bringing up hot bottles, and heating of flannels, and
chafing, and fussing, that ensued, there was quite a diversion.

tom, however, had a feeling at his own heart, that drew him to his
master. he followed him wherever he walked, wistfully and sadly; and
when he saw him sitting, so pale and quiet, in evaâ€™s room, holding
before his eyes her little open bible, th

ough seeing no letter or word
of what was in it, there was more sorrow to tom in that still, fixed,
tearless eye, than in all marieâ€™s moans and lamentations.

in a few days the st. clare family were back again in the city;
augustine, with the restlessness of grief, longing for another scene, to
change the current of his thoughts. so they left the house and garden,
with its little grave, and came back to new orleans; and st. clare
walked the streets busily, and strove to fill up the chasm in his heart
with hurry and bustle, and change of place; and people who saw him in
the street, or met him at the cafe, knew of his loss

only by the weed
on his hat; for there he was, smiling and talking, and reading the
newspaper, and speculating on politics, and attending to business
matters; and who could see that all this smiling outside was but a
hollowed shell over a heart that was a dark and silent sepulchre?

â€œmr. st. clare is a singular man,â€ said marie to miss ophelia, in a
complaining tone. â€œi used to think, if there was anything in the world
he did love, it was our dear little eva; but he seems to be forgetting
her very easily. i cannot ever get him to talk about her. i really did
think he would show more feeling!â€

â€œstill waters run deepest, they used to tell me,â€ said miss ophelia,
oracularly.

â€œo, i donâ€™t believe in such things; itâ€™s all talk. if people have
feeling, they will show it,--they canâ€™t help it; but, then, itâ€
 
 ___________________________
 
™s a great
misfortune to have feeling. iâ€™d rather have been made like st. clare. my
feelings prey upon me so!â€

â€œsure, missis, masâ€™r st. clare is gettinâ€™ thin as a shader. they say, he
donâ€™t never eat nothinâ€™,â€ said mammy. â€œi know he donâ€™t forget miss eva;
i know there couldnâ€™t nobody,--dear, little, blessed cretur!â€ she added,
wiping her eyes.

â€œwell, at all events, he has no consideration for me,â€ said marie; â€œhe
hasnâ€™t spoken one word of sympathy, and he must know how much more a
mother feels than any man can.â€

â€œthe heart knoweth its own bitterness,â€ said miss ophelia, gravely.

â€œthatâ€™s just what i think. i know just what i feel,--nobody else seems
to. eva used to, but she is gone!â€ and marie lay back on her lounge, and
began to sob disconsolately.

marie was one of those unfortunately constituted mortals, in whose
eyes whatever is lost and gone assumes a value which it never had

â€

â€œwhy, even a poor fellow like me has a work from the lord; and masâ€™r st.
clare, that has larnin, and riches, and friends,--how much he might do
for the lord!â€

â€œtom, you seem to think the lord needs a great deal done for him,â€ said
st. clare, smiling.

â€œwe does for the lord when we does for his critturs,â€ said tom.

â€œgood theology, tom; better than dr. b. preaches, i dare swear,â€ said
st. clare.

the conversation was here interrupted by the announcement of some
visitors.

marie st. clare felt the loss of eva as deeply as she could feel
anything; and, as she was a woman that had a great faculty of making
everybody unhappy when she was, her immediate attendants had still
stronger reason to regret the loss of their young mistress, whose
winning ways and gentle intercessions had so often been a shield to them
from the tyrannical and selfish exactions of her mother. poor old mammy,
in particular, whose heart, severed from all natural domestic ties, had
consoled itself with

s of a
yankee, there is nothing for it but to concede;â€ and st. clare rapidly
wrote off a deed of gift, which, as he was well versed in the forms
of law, he could easily do, and signed his name to it in sprawling
capitals, concluding by a tremendous flourish.

â€œthere, isnâ€™t that black and white, now, miss vermont?â€ he said, as he
handed it to her.

â€œgood boy,â€ said miss ophelia, smiling. â€œbut must it not be witnessed?â€

â€œo, bother!--yes. here,â€ he said, opening the door into marieâ€™s
apartment, â€œmarie, cousin wants your autograph; just put your name down
here.â€

â€œwhatâ€™s this?â€ said marie, as she ran over the paper. â€œridiculous! i
thought cousin was too pious for such horrid things,â€ she added, as she
carelessly wrote her name; â€œbut, if she has a fancy for that article, i
am sure sheâ€™s welcome.â€

â€œthere, now, sheâ€™s yours, body and soul,â€ said st. clare, handing the
paper.

â€œno more mine now than she was before,â€ miss ophelia. â€œnobody but g

has a right to give her to me; but i can protect her now.â€

â€œwell, sheâ€™s yours by a fiction of law, then,â€ said st. clare, as he
turned back into the parlor, and sat down to his paper.

miss ophelia, who seldom sat much in marieâ€™s company, followed him into
the parlor, having first carefully laid away the paper.

â€œaugustine,â€ she said, suddenly, as she sat knitting, â€œhave you ever
made any provision for your servants, in case of your death?â€

â€œno,â€ said st. clare, as he read on.

â€œthen all your indulgence to them may prove a great cruelty, by and by.â€

st. clare had often thought the same thing himself; but he answered,
negligently.

â€œwell, i mean to make a provision, by and by.â€

â€œwhen?â€ said
 
 ___________________________
 
 just what i have,--living good, easy, respectable lives;
and not troubling themselves to inquire how many of their brethren were
hungry or athirst, or sick, or in prison.â€

tom did not answer.

st. clare rose up and walked thoughtfully up and down the verandah,
seeming to forget everything in his own thoughts; so absorbed was he,
that tom had to remind him twice that the teabell had rung, before he
could get his attention.

st. clare was absent and thoughtful, all tea-time. after tea, he and
marie and miss ophelia took possession of the parlor almost in silence.

marie disposed herself on a lounge, under a silken mosquito curtain,
and was soon sound asleep. miss ophelia silently busied herself with her
knitting. st. clare sat down to the piano, and began playing a soft and
melancholy movement with the Ã¦olian accompaniment. he seemed in a deep
reverie, and to be soliloquizing to himself by music. after a little, he
opened one of the drawers, took out an old music-book whose leaves were

o gentlemen in the room, who
were both partially intoxicated. st. clare and one or two others made an
effort to separate them, and st. clare received a fatal stab in the side
with a bowie-knife, which he was attempting to wrest from one of them.

the house was full of cries and lamentations, shrieks and screams,
servants frantically tearing their hair, throwing themselves on the
ground, or running distractedly about, lamenting. tom and miss ophelia
alone seemed to have any presence of mind; for marie was in strong
hysteric convulsions. at miss opheliaâ€™s direction, one of the lounges in
the parlor was hastily prepared, and the bleeding form laid upon it. st.
clare had fainted, through pain and loss of blood; but, as miss ophelia
applied restoratives, he revived, opened his eyes, looked fixedly on
them, looked earnestly around the room, his eyes travelling wistfully
over every object, and finally they rested on his motherâ€™s picture.

the physician now arrived, and made his examination. it

t best of all; so that he feels that there are ten chances of
his finding an abusive and tyrannical master, to one of his finding
a considerate and kind one. therefore is it that the wail over a kind
master is loud and long, as well it may be.

when st. clare breathed his last, terror and consternation took hold
of all his household. he had been stricken down so in a moment, in the
flower and strength of his youth! every room and gallery of the house
resounded with sobs and shrieks of despair.

marie, whose nervous system had been enervated by a constant course of
self-indulgence, had nothing to support the terror of the shock, and,
at the time her husband breathed his last, was passing from one fainting
fit to another; and he to whom she had been joined in the mysterious tie
of marriage passed from her forever, without the possibility of even a
parting word.

miss ophelia, with characteristic strength and self-control, had
remained with her kinsman to the last,--all eye, all ear, all atten

affectionate nature, he felt able to perceive something of the fulness
of divine love; for an old oracle hath thus written,--â€œhe that dwelleth

at peace.

but the funeral passed, with all its pageant of black crape, and
prayers, and solemn faces; and back rolled the cool, muddy waves of
every-day life; and up came the everlasting hard inquiry of â€œwhat is to
be done next?â€

it rose to the mind of marie, as, dressed in loose morning-robes, and
surrounded by anxious servants, she sat up in a great easy-chair, and
inspected samples of crape and bombazine. it rose to miss ophelia, who
began to turn her thoughts towards her northern home. it rose, in silent
terrors, to the minds of the servants, who well knew the unfeeling,
tyrannical character of the mistress in whose hands they were left. all
knew, very well, that the indulgences which had been accorded to them
were not from their mistress, but 
 
 ___________________________
 
screen between them and every tyrannous
infliction which a temper soured by affliction might devise.

it was about a fortnight after the funeral, that miss ophelia, busied
one day in her apartment, heard a gentle tap at the door. she opened
it, and there stood rosa, the pretty young quadroon, whom we have before
often noticed, her hair in disorder, and her eyes swelled with crying.

â€œo, miss feeley,â€ she said, falling on her knees, and catching the skirt
of her dress, â€œ_do, do go_ to miss marie for me! do plead for me! sheâ€™s
goinâ€™ to send me out to be whipped--look there!â€ and she handed to miss
ophelia a paper.

it was an order, written in marieâ€™s delicate italian hand, to the master
of a whipping-establishment to give the bearer fifteen lashes.

â€œwhat have you been doing?â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œyou know, miss feely, iâ€™ve got such a bad temper; itâ€™s very bad of me.
i was trying on miss marieâ€™s dress, and she slapped my face; and i spoke
out before i thought, and wa

s saucy; and she said that sheâ€™d bring
me down, and have me know, once for all, that i wasnâ€™t going to be so
topping as i had been; and she wrote this, and says i shall carry it.
iâ€™d rather sheâ€™d kill me, right out.â€

miss ophelia stood considering, with the paper in her hand.

â€œyou see, miss feely,â€ said rosa, â€œi donâ€™t mind the whipping so much, if
miss marie or you was to do it; but, to be sent to a _man!_ and such a
horrid man,--the shame of it, miss feely!â€

miss ophelia well knew that it was the universal custom to send women
and young girls to whipping-houses, to the hands of the lowest of
men,--men vile enough to make this their profession,--there to be
subjected to brutal exposure and shameful correction. she had _known_ it
before; but hitherto she had never realized it, till she saw the slender
form of rosa almost convulsed with distress.

all the honest blood of
womanhood, the strong new england blood of liberty, flushed to her
cheeks, and throbbed bitterly in her indignant heart; but, with habitual
prudence and self-control, she mastered herself, and, crushing the paper
firmly in her hand, she merely said to rosa,

â€œsit down, child, while i go to your mistress.â€

â€œshameful! monstrous! outrageous!â€ she said to herself, as she was
crossing the parlor.

she found marie sitting up in her easy-chair, with mammy standing
by her, combing her hair; jane sat on the ground before her, busy in
chafing her feet.

â€œhow do you find yourself, today?â€ said miss ophelia.

a deep sigh, and a closing of the eyes, was the only reply, for a
moment; and then marie answered, â€œo, i donâ€™t know, cousin; i suppose
iâ€™m as well as i ever shall be!â€ and marie wiped her eyes with a cambric
handkerchief, bordered with an inch deep of black.

â€œi came,â€ said miss ophelia, w

rosa.â€

marieâ€™s eyes were open wide enough now, and a flush rose to her sallow
cheeks, as she answered, sharply,

â€œwell, what about her?â€

â€œshe is very sorry for her fault.â€

â€œshe is, is she? sheâ€™ll be sorrier, before iâ€™ve done with her! iâ€™ve
endured that childâ€™s impudence long enough; and now iâ€™ll bring her
down,--iâ€™ll make her lie in the dust!â€

â€œbut could not you punish her some other way,--some way that would be
less shameful?â€

â€œi mean to shame her; thatâ€™s just what i w

ant. she has all her life
presumed on her delicacy, and her good looks, and her lady-like airs,
till she forgets who she is;--and iâ€™ll give her one lesson that will
bring her down, i fancy!â€

â€œbut, cousin, consider that, if you destroy delicacy and a sense of
shame in a young girl, you deprave her very fast.â€

â€œdelicacy!â€ said marie, with a scornful laugh,--â€œa fine word for such
as she! iâ€™ll teach her, with all her airs, that sheâ€™s no better than the
raggedest black wench that walks the streets! sheâ€™ll take no more airs
with me!â€

â€œyou will answer to god for such cruelty!â€ said miss ophelia, with
energy.

â€œcruelty,--iâ€™d like to know what the cruelty is! i wrote orders for only
fifteen lashes, and told him to put them on lightly. iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s no
cruelty there!â€

â€œno cruelty!â€ said miss opheli

any girl might rather be

â€œit might seem so to anybody with your feeling; but all these creatures
get used to it; itâ€™s the only way they can be kept in order. once let
them feel that they are to take any airs about delicacy, and all that,
and theyâ€™ll run all over you, just as my servants always have. iâ€™ve
begun now to bring them under; and iâ€™ll have them all to know that
iâ€™ll send one out to be whipped, as soon as another, if they donâ€™t mind
themselves!â€ said marie, looking around her decidedly.

jane hung her head and cowered at this, for she felt as if it was
particularly directed to her. miss ophelia sat for a moment, as if she
had swallowed some explosive mixture, and were ready to burst. then,
recollecting the utter uselessness of contention with such a nature,
she shut her lips resolutely, gathered herself up, and walked out of the
room.

it was hard to go back and tell rosa that she could do nothing for
her; and, shortly after, one of the man-serva

nts came to say that her
mistress had ordered him to take rosa with him to the whipping-house,
whither she was hurried, in spite of her tears and entreaties.

a few days after, tom was standing musing by the balconies, when he was
joined by adolph, who, since the death of his master, had been entirely
crest-fallen and disconsolate. adolph knew that he had always been an
object of dislike to marie; but while his master lived he had paid but
little attention to it. now that he was gone, he had moved about in
daily dread and trembling, not knowing what might befall him next. marie
had held several consultations with her lawyer; after communicating with
st. clareâ€™s brother, it was determined to sell the place, and all the
servants, except her own personal property, and these she intended to
take with her, and go back to her fatherâ€™s plantation.

â€œdo ye know, tom, that weâ€™ve all got

like goinâ€™ on with it, was it as masâ€™r st. clareâ€™s wish.â€

â€œiâ€™ll speak for you, tom, and do my best,â€ said miss ophelia; â€œbut, if
it depends on mrs. st. clare, i canâ€™t hope much for you;--nevertheless,
i will try.â€

this incident occurred a few days after that of rosa, while miss ophelia
was busied in preparations to return north.

seriously reflecting within herself, she considered that perhaps she had
shown too hasty a warmth of language in her former interview with marie;
and she resolved that she would now endeavor to moderate her zeal, and
to be as conciliatory as possible. so the good soul gathered herself
up, and, taking her knitting, resolved to go into marieâ€™s room, be as
agreeable as possible, and negotiate tomâ€™s case with all the diplomatic
skill of which she was mistress.

she found marie reclining at length upon a lounge, supporting herself
on one elbow by pillows, while jane, who had been out shopping, was
displaying before her certain samples of

 thin black stuffs.

â€œthat will do,â€ said marie, selecting one; â€œonly iâ€™m not sure about its
being properly mourning.â€

â€œlaws, missis,â€ said jane, volubly, â€œmrs. general derbennon wore just
this very thing, after the general died, last summer; it makes up
lovely!â€

â€œwhat do you think?â€ said marie to miss ophelia.

â€œitâ€™s a matter of custom, i suppose,â€ said miss ophelia. â€œyou can judge
about it better than i.â€

â€œthe fact is,â€ said marie, â€œthat i havenâ€™t a dress in the world that i
can wear; and, as i am going to break up the establishment, and go off,
next week, i must decide upon something.â€

â€œare you going so soon?â€

â€œyes. st. clareâ€™s brother has written, and he and the lawyer think that
the servants and furniture had better be put up at auction, and the
place left with our lawyer.â€

â€œthereâ€™s one thing i wanted to speak with you about,â€ said miss ophelia.
â€œaugustine promised tom his liberty, and began

 the legal forms necessary
to it. i hope you will use your influence to have it perfected.â€

â€œindeed, i shall do no such thing!â€ said marie, sharply. â€œtom is one of
the most valuable servants on the place,--it couldnâ€™t be afforded, any
way. besides, what does he want of liberty? heâ€™s a great deal better off
as he is.â€

â€œbut he does desire it, very earnestly, and his master promised it,â€
 said miss ophelia.

â€œi dare say he does want it,â€ said marie; â€œthey all want it, just
because they are a discontented set,--always wanting what they havenâ€™t
got. now, iâ€™m principled against emancipating, in any case. keep a negro
under the care of a master, and he does well enough, and is respectable;
but set them free, and they get lazy, and wonâ€™t work, and take to
drinking, and go all down to be mean, worthless fellows, iâ€™ve seen it
tried, hundreds of times. itâ€™s no favor to set them free.â€

â€œbut tom is so steady, industrious, and pious

.â€

â€œo, you neednâ€™t tell me! iâ€™ve see a hundred like him. heâ€™ll do very
well, as long as heâ€™s taken care of,--thatâ€™s all.â€

â€œbut, then, consider,â€ said miss ophelia, â€œwhen you set him up for sale,
the chances of his getting a bad master.â€

â€œo, thatâ€™s all humbug!â€ said marie; â€œit isnâ€™t one time in a hundred that
a good fellow gets a bad master; most masters are good, for all the talk
that is made. iâ€™ve lived and grown up here, in the south, and i
never yet was acquainted with a master that didnâ€™t treat his servants
well,--quite as well as is worth while. i donâ€™t feel any fears on that
head.â€

â€œwell,â€ said miss ophelia, energetically, â€œi know it was one of the last
wishes of your husband that tom should have his liberty; it was one of
the promises

that he made to dear little eva on her death-bed, and i
should not think you would feel at liberty to disregard it.â€

marie had her face covered with her handkerchief at this appeal, and
began sobbing and using her smelling-bottle, with great vehemence.

â€œeverybody goes against me!â€ she said. â€œeverybody is so inconsiderate! i
shouldnâ€™t have expected that _you_ would bring up all these remembrances
of my troubles to me,--itâ€™s so inconsiderate! but nobody ever does
consider,--my trials are so peculiar! itâ€™s so hard, that when i had only
one daughter, she should have been taken!--and when i had a husband th

just exactly suited me,--and iâ€™m so hard to be suited!--he should be
taken! and you seem to have so little feeling for me, and keep bringing
it up to me so carelessly,--when you know how it overcomes me! i suppose
you mean well; but it is very inconsiderate,--very!â€ and marie sobbed,
and gasped for breath, and called mammy to open the window, and to bring
her the camphor-bottle, and to bathe her head, and unhook her dress.
and, in the general confusion that ensued, miss ophelia made her escape
to her apartment.

she saw, at once, that it would do no good to say anything more; for
marie had an indefinite capacity for hysteric fits; and, after this,
whenever her husbandâ€™s or evaâ€™s wishes with regard to the servants were
alluded to, she always found it convenient t

rocks rent, and the graves were opened, can be sold, leased, mortgaged,

it was a day or two after the conversation between marie and miss
ophelia, that tom, adolph, and about half a dozen others of the st.
clare estate, were turned over to the loving kindness of mr. skeggs, the
keeper of a depot on ---- street, to await the auction, next day.

tom had with him quite a sizable trunk full of clothing, as had most
others of them. they were ushered, for the night, into a long room,
where many other men, of all ages, sizes, and shades of complexion, were
assembled, and from which roars of laughter and unthinking merriment
