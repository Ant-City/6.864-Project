the [CHARACTER] - 
                    the
[CHARACTER] makes it quite clear that he is also a character in his
book. although he is called chaucer, we should be wary of accepting
his words and opinions as chaucer's own. in the general prologue,
the [CHARACTER] presents himself as a gregarious and naive character.
later on, the host accuses him of being silent and sullen. because
the [CHARACTER] writes down his impressions of the pilgrims from memory,
whom he does and does not like, and what he chooses and chooses
not to remember about the characters, tells us as much about the
[CHARACTER]'s own prejudices as it does about the characters themselves.
