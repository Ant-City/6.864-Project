 broad and innocent as a cabbage and was tied around with a green head-kerchief that had two points on the top like rabbit's ears. she was sitting on the sofa, feeding the baby his apricots out of a jar. "the children have been to florida before," the old lady said. "you all ought to take them somewhere else for a change so they would see different parts of the world and be broad. they never have been to east tennessee."

the children's mother didn't seem to hear her but the eight-year-old boy, john wesley, a stocky child with glasses, said, "if you don't want to go to florida, why dontcha stay at home?" he and the little girl, june star, were reading the funny papers on the floor.

"she wouldn't stay at home to be queen for a day," june star said without raising her yellow head.

"yes and what would you do if this fellow, the misfit, caught you?" the grandmother asked.

"i'd smack his face," john wesley said.

"she wouldn't stay at home for a million bucks," june star said. "afraid she'd miss so

car, ready to go. she had her big black valise that looked like the head of a hippopotamus in one corner, and underneath it she was hiding a basket with pitty sing, the cat, in it. she didn't intend for the cat to be left alone in the house for three days because he would miss her too much and she was afraid he might brush against one of the gas burners and accidentally asphyxiate himself. her son, bailey, didn't like to arrive at a motel with a cat.

she sat in the middle of the back seat with john wesley and june star on either side of her. bailey and the children's mother and the baby sat in front and they left atlanta at eight forty-five with the mileage on the car at 55890. the grandmother wrote this down because she thought it would be interesting to say how many miles they had been when they got back. it took them twenty minutes to reach the outskirts of the city.

the old lady settled herself comfortably, removing her white cotton gloves and putting them up with her purse on the shelf in

that made rows of green lace-work on the ground. the trees were full of silver-white sunlight and the meanest of them sparkled. the children were reading comic magazines and their mother had gone back to sleep.

"let's go through georgia fast so we won't have to look at it much," john wesley said.

"if i were a little boy," said the grandmother, "i wouldn't talk about my native state that way. tennessee has the mountains and georgia has the hills."

"tennessee is just a hillbilly dumping ground," john wesley said, "and georgia is a lousy state too."

"you said it," june star said.

"in my time," said the grandmother, folding her thin veined fingers, "children were more respectful of their native states and their parents and everything else. people did right then. oh look at the cut

him on her knee and bounced him and told him about the things they were passing. she rolled her eyes and screwed up her mouth and stuck her leathery thin face into his smooth bland one. occasionally he gave her a faraway smile. they passed a large cotton field with five or six graves fenced in the middle of it, like a small island. "look at the graveyard!" the grandmother said, pointing it out. "that was the old family burying ground. that belonged to the plantation."

"where's the plantation?" john wesley asked.

"gone with the wind," said the grandmother. "ha. ha."

when the children finished all the comic books they had brought, they opened the lunch and ate it. the grandmother ate a peanut butter sandwich and an olive and would not let

a cow and june star guessed a cow and john wesley said, no, an automobile, and june star said he didn't play fair, and they began to slap each other over the grandmother.

the grandmother said she would tell them a story if they would keep quiet. when she told a story, she rolled her eyes and waved her head and was very dramatic. she said once when she was a maiden lady she had been courted by a mr. edgar atkins teagarden from jasper, georgia. she said he was a very good-looking man and a gentleman and that he brought her a watermelon every sa

turday afternoon with his initials cut in it, e. a. t. well, one saturday, she said, mr. teagarden brought the watermelon and there was nobody at home and he left it on the front porch and returned in his buggy to jasper, but she never got the watermelon, she said, because a nigger boy ate it when he saw the initials, e. a. t.! this story tickled john wesley's funny bone and he giggled and giggled but june star didn't think it was any good. she said she wouldn't marry a man that just brought her a watermelon on saturday. the grandmother said she would have done well to marry mr. teagarden because he was a gentleman and had bought coca-cola stock when it first came out and that he had died only a few years ago, a very wealthy man.

actly which road to turn off to get to it. she knew that bailey would not be willing to lose any time looking at an old house, but the more she talked about it, the more she wanted to see it once again and find out if the little twin arbors were still standing. "there was a secret panel in this house," she said craftily, not telling the truth but wishing that she were, "and the story went that all the family silver was hidden in it when sherman came through but it was never found . . ."

"hey!" john wesley said. "let's go see it! we'll find it! we'll poke all the woodwork and find it! who lives there? where do you turn off at? hey pop, can't we turn off there?"

"we never have seen a house with a secret panel!" june star shrieked. "let's go to the house with the secret panel! hey pop, can't we go see the house with the secret panel!"

"it's not far from here, i know," the grandmother said. "it wouldn't take over twenty minutes."

bailey was looking straight ahead. his jaw was as rigid as a horses

hoe. "no," he said.

the children began to yell and scream that they wanted to see the house with the secret panel. john wesley kicked the back of the front seat and june star hung over her mother's shoulder and whined desperately into her ear that they never had any fun even on their vacation, that they could never do what they wanted to do. the baby began to scream and john wesley kicked the back of the seat so hard that his father could feel the blows in his kidney.

"all right!" he shouted and drew the car to a stop at the side of the road. "will you all shut up? will you all just shut up for one second? if you don't shut up, we won't go anywhere.

"it would be very educational for them," the grandmother murmured.

"all right," bailey said, "but get this: this is the only time we're going to stop for anything like this. this is the one and only time."

"the dirt road t

hat you have to turn down is about a mile back," the grandmother directed. "i marked it when we passed."

"a dirt road," bailey groaned.

after they had turned around and were headed toward the dirt road, the grandmother recalled other points about the house, the beautiful glass over the front doorway and the candle-lamp in the hall. john wesley said that the secret panel was probably in the fireplace.

"you can't go inside this house," bailey said. "you don't know who lives there."

"while you all talk to the people in front, i'll run around behind and get in a window," john wesley suggested.

"we'll all stay in the car," his mother said. they turned onto the dirt road and the car raced roughly along in a swirl of pink dust. the grandmother recalled the times when there were no paved roads and thirty miles was a day's journey. the dir

ld not recall who he was. he moved away from the car and began to come down the embankment, placing his feet carefully so that he wouldn't slip. he had on tan and white shoes and no socks, and his ankles were red and thin. "good afternoon," he said. "i see you all had you a little spill."

"we turned over twice!" said the grandmother.

"once"," he corrected. "we seen it happen. try their car and see will it run, hiram," he said quietly to the boy with the gray hat.

"what you got that gun for?" john wesley asked. "whatcha gonna do with that gun?"

"lady," the man said to the children's mother, "would you mind calling them children to sit down by you? children make me nervous. i want all you all to sit down right together there where you're at."

"what are you telling us what to do for?" june star asked.

behind them the line of woods gaped like a dark open mouth. "come here," said their mother.

"look here now," bailey began suddenly, "we're in a predicament! we're in . . ."

"i prechate that, lady," the misfit said and drew a little circle in the ground with the butt of his gun.

"it'll take a half a hour to fix this here car," hiram called, looking over the raised hood of it.

"well, first you and bobby lee get him and that little boy to step over yonder with you," the misfit said, pointing to bailey and john wesley. "the boys want to ast you some- thing," he said to bailey. "would you mind stepping back in them woods there with them?"

"listen," bailey began, "we're in a terrible predicament! nobody realizes what this is," and his voice cracked. his eyes were as blue and intense as the parrots in his shirt and he remained perfectly still.

the grandmother reached up to adjust her hat brim as if she were going to the woods with him but it came off in her hand. she stood staring at it and after a second she

"come back this instant!" his mother shrilled but they all disappeared into the woods.

"bailey boy!" the grandmother called in a tragic voice but she found she was looking at the misfit squatting on the ground in front of her. "i just know
