Kent - 
                A
nobleman of the same rank as Gloucester who is loyal to King Lear.
Kent spends most of the play disguised as a peasant, calling himself
"Caius," so that he can continue to serve Lear even after Lear banishes him.
He is extremely loyal, but he gets himself into trouble throughout
the play by being extremely blunt and outspoken.
