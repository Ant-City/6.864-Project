scene 

the same as in oedipus the king, an open space before the royal palace, once that of oedipus, at thebes. the backscene represents the front of the palace, with three doors, of which the central and largest is the principal entrance into the house. the time is at daybreak on the morning after the fall of the two brothers, eteocles and polyneices, and the flight of the defeated argives. antigone calls ismene forth from the palace, in order to speak to her alone.

exit antigone on the spectators' left. ismene retires into the palace by one of the two side-doors. when they have departed, the chorus of theban elders enters.
