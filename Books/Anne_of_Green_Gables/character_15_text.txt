ith a boy’s. not, of
course,” she hastened to add, “that anybody would.”

anne sighed. she didn’t want her name written up. but it was a little
humiliating to know that there was no danger of it.

“nonsense,” said diana, whose black eyes and glossy tresses had played
such havoc with the hearts of avonlea schoolboys that her name figured
on the porch walls in half a dozen take-notices. “it’s only meant as
a joke. and don’t you be too sure your name won’t ever be written up.
charlie sloane is _dead gone_ on you. he told his mother--his _mother_,
mind you--that you were the smartest girl in school. that’s better than
being good looking.”

“no, it isn’t,” said anne, feminine to the core. “i’d rather be pretty
than clever. and i hate charlie sloane, i can’t bear a boy with goggle
eyes. if anyone wrote my name up with his i’d never _get_ over it, diana
barry. but it _is_ nice to keep head of your class.”

“you’ll have gilbert in your class after this,” said

“ann shirley has a very bad temper. ann shirley must learn to control
her temper,” and then read it out loud so that even the primer class,
who couldn’t read writing, should understand it.

anne stood there the rest of the afternoon with that legend above her.
she did not cry or hang her head. anger was still too hot in her heart
for that and it sustained her amid all her agony of humiliation. with
resentful eyes and passion-red cheeks she confronted alike diana’s
sympathetic gaze and charlie sloane’s indignant nods and josie pye’s
malicious smiles. as for gilbert blythe, she would not even look at him.
she would _never_ look at him again! she would never speak to him!!

when school was dismissed anne marched out with her red head held high.
gilbert blythe tried to intercept her at the porch door.

“i’m awfully sorry i made fun of your hair, anne,” he whispered
contritely. “honest i am. don’t be mad for keeps, now.”

anne swept by disdainfully, without look or sign of heari

and talking as hard as they could. diana had much to tell anne of what
went on in school. she had to sit with gertie pye and she hated
it; gertie squeaked her pencil all the time and it just made
her--diana’s--blood run cold; ruby gillis had charmed all her warts
away, true’s you live, with a magic pebble that old mary joe from the
creek gave her. you had to rub the warts with the pebble and then throw
it away over your left shoulder at the time of the new moon and the
warts would all go. charlie sloane’s name was written up with em white’s
on the porch wall and em white was _awful mad_ about it; sam boulter had
“sassed” mr. phillips in class and mr. phillips whipped him and sam’s
father came down to the school and dared mr. phillips to lay a hand on
one of his children again; and mattie andrews had a new red hood and a
blue crossover with tassels on it and the airs she put on about it were
perfectly sickening; and lizzie wright didn’t speak to mamie wilson

awberry apple.” anne caught it up all ready to take a bite when she
remembered that the only place in avonlea where strawberry apples grew
was in the old blythe orchard on the other side of the lake of shining
waters. anne dropped the apple as if it were a red-hot coal and
ostentatiously wiped her fingers on her handkerchief. the apple lay
untouched on her desk until the next morning, when little timothy
andrews, who swept the school and kindled the fire, annexed it as one
of his perquisites. charlie sloane’s slate pencil, gorgeously bedizened
with striped red and yellow paper, costing two cents where ordinary
pencils cost only one, which he sent up to her after dinner hour, met
with a more favorable reception. anne was graciously pleased to accept
it and rewarded the donor with a smile which exalted that infatuated
youth straightway into the seventh heaven of delight and caused him to
make such fearful errors in his dictation that mr. phillips kept him in
after school to rewrite it.

la? and diana says if they don’t know what they are like they don’t
miss them. but i think that is the saddest thing of all. i think it
would be _tragic_, marilla, not to know what mayflowers are like and _not_
to miss them. do you know what i think mayflowers are, marilla? i think
they must be the souls of the flowers that died last summer and this
is their heaven. but we had a splendid time today, marilla. we had our
lunch down in a big mossy hollow by an old well--such a _romantic_ spot.
charlie sloane dared arty gillis to jump over it, and arty did because
he wouldn’t take a dare. nobody would in school. it is very _fashionable_
to dare. mr. phillips gave all the mayflowers he found to prissy andrews
and i heard him to say ‘sweets to the sweet.’ he got that out of a
book, i know; but it shows he has some imagination. i was offered some
mayflowers too, but i rejected them with scorn. i can’t tell you the
person’s name because i have vowed never to let it cross my lips. we

 ejaculated marilla, who had
listened in dumb amazement. “anne shirley, do you mean to tell me you
believe all that wicked nonsense of your own imagination?”

“not believe _exactly_,” faltered anne. “at least, i don’t believe it in
daylight. but after dark, marilla, it’s different. that is when ghosts
walk.”

“there are no such things as ghosts, anne.”

“oh, but there are, marilla,” cried anne eagerly. “i know people who
have seen them. and they are respectable people. charlie sloane says
that his grandmother saw his grandfather driving home the cows one night
after he’d been buried for a year. you know charlie sloane’s grandmother
wouldn’t tell a story for anything. she’s a very religious woman. and
mrs. thomas’s father was pursued home one night by a lamb of fire with
its head cut off hanging by a strip of skin. he said he knew it was the
spirit of his brother and that it was a warning he would die within nine
days. he didn’t, but he died two years after, so y

ars was broken up. josie pye and julia bell did
not “speak” for three months, because josie pye had told bessie wright
that julia bell’s bow when she got up to recite made her think of a
chicken jerking its head, and bessie told julia. none of the sloanes
would have any dealings with the bells, because the bells had declared
that the sloanes had too much to do in the program, and the sloanes had
retorted that the bells were not capable of doing the little they had to
do properly. finally, charlie sloane fought moody spurgeon macpherson,
because moody spurgeon had said that anne shirley put on airs about
her recitations, and moody spurgeon was “licked”; consequently moody
spurgeon’s sister, ella may, would not “speak” to anne shirley all the
rest of the winter. with the exception of these trifling frictions, work
in miss stacy’s little kingdom went on with regularity and smoothness.

the winter weeks slipped by. it was an unusually mild winter, with so
little snow that anne and dian

est than ever in my studies now,” said anne
blissfully, “because i have a purpose in life. mr. allan says everybody
should have a purpose in life and pursue it faithfully. only he says
we must first make sure that it is a worthy purpose. i would call it a
worthy purpose to want to be a teacher like miss stacy, wouldn’t you,
marilla? i think it’s a very noble profession.”

the queen’s class was organized in due time. gilbert blythe, anne
shirley, ruby gillis, jane andrews, josie pye, charlie sloane, and moody
spurgeon macpherson joined it. diana barry did not, as her parents
did not intend to send her to queen’s. this seemed nothing short of a
calamity to anne. never, since the night on which minnie may had had the
croup, had she and diana been separated in anything. on the evening when
the queen’s class first remained in school for the extra lessons and
anne saw diana go slowly out with the others, to walk home alone through
the birch path and violet vale, it was all the former could

ifferent with orphans who
are living on charity--_they_ have to hustle. moody spurgeon is going to
be a minister. mrs. lynde says he couldn’t be anything else with a name
like that to live up to. i hope it isn’t wicked of me, marilla, but
really the thought of moody spurgeon being a minister makes me laugh.
he’s such a funny-looking boy with that big fat face, and his little
blue eyes, and his ears sticking out like flaps. but perhaps he will
be more intellectual looking when he grows up. charlie sloane says he’s
going to go into politics and be a member of parliament, but mrs. lynde
says he’ll never succeed at that, because the sloanes are all honest
people, and it’s only rascals that get on in politics nowadays.”

“what is gilbert blythe going to be?” queried marilla, seeing that anne
was opening her caesar.

“i don’t happen to know what gilbert blythe’s ambition in life is--if he
has any,” said anne scornfully.

there was open rivalry between gilbert and anne now. previo

and at least neither gilbert nor anybody else, not even diana, should
ever suspect how sorry she was and how much she wished she hadn’t been
so proud and horrid! she determined to “shroud her feelings in deepest
oblivion,” and it may be stated here and now that she did it, so
successfully that gilbert, who possibly was not quite so indifferent as
he seemed, could not console himself with any belief that anne felt his
retaliatory scorn. the only poor comfort he had was that she snubbed
charlie sloane, unmercifully, continually, and undeservedly.

otherwise the winter passed away in a round of pleasant duties and
studies. for anne the days slipped by like golden beads on the necklace
of the year. she was happy, eager, interested; there were lessons to be
learned and honor to be won; delightful books to read; new pieces to be
practiced for the sunday-school choir; pleasant saturday afternoons at
the manse with mrs. allan; and then, almost before anne realized it,
spring had come again to gree

ost decided to give up trying to like josie pye. i’ve made what i
would once have called a heroic effort to like her, but josie pye won’t
_be_ liked.”

“josie is a pye,” said marilla sharply, “so she can’t help being
disagreeable. i suppose people of that kind serve some useful purpose in
society, but i must say i don’t know what it is any more than i know the
use of thistles. is josie going to teach?”

“no, she is going back to queen’s next year. so are moody spurgeon and
charlie sloane. jane and ruby are going to teach and they have both got
schools--jane at newbridge and ruby at some place up west.”

“gilbert blythe is going to teach too, isn’t he?”

“yes”--briefly.

“what a nice-looking fellow he is,” said marilla absently. “i saw him in
church last sunday and he seemed so tall and manly. he looks a lot like
his father did at the same age. john blythe was a nice boy. we used to
be real good friends, he and i. people called him my beau.”

anne looked up w
