left and went up the side street. his features were composed in stern calm. lenehan kept up with his friend, breathing uneasily. he was baffled and a note of menace pierced through his voice.
“can’t you tell us?” he said. “did you try her?”
corley halted at the first lamp and stared grimly before him. then with a grave gesture he extended a hand towards the light and, smiling, opened it slowly to the gaze of his disciple. a small gold coin shone in the palm.




the boarding house

mrs mooney was a butcher’s daughter. she was a woman who was quite able to keep things to herself: a determined woman. she had married her father’s foreman and opened a butcher’s shop near spring gardens. but as soon as his father-in-law was dead mr mooney began to go to the devil. he drank, plundered the till, ran headlong into debt. it was no use making him take the pledge: he was sure to break out again a few days after. by fighting his wife in the presence of customers and by buying bad meat he

after that they lived apart. she went to the priest and got a separation from him with care of the children. she would give him neither money nor food nor house-room; and so he was obliged to enlist himself as a sheriff’s man. he was a shabby stooped little drunkard with a white face and a white moustache and white eyebrows, pencilled above his little eyes, which were pink-veined and raw; and all day long he sat in the bailiff’s room, waiting to be put on a job. mrs mooney, who had taken what remained of her money out of the butcher business and set up a boarding house in hardwicke street, was a big imposing woman. her house had a floating population made up of tourists from liverpool and the isle of man and, occasionally, artistes from the music-halls. its resident population was made up of clerks from the city. she governed her house cunningly and firmly, knew when to give credit, when to be stern and when to let things pass. all the resident young men spoke of

 her as the madam.
mrs mooney’s young men paid fifteen shillings a week for board and lodgings (beer or stout at dinner excluded). they shared in common tastes and occupations and for this reason they were very chummy with one another. they discussed with one another the chances of favourites and outsiders. jack mooney, the madam’s son, who was clerk to a commission agent in fleet street, had the reputation of being a hard case. he was fond of using soldiers’ obscenities: usually he came home in the small hours. when he met his friends he had always a good one to tell them and he was always sure to be on to a good thing—that is to say, a likely horse or a likely artiste. he was also handy with the mits and sang comic songs. on sunday nights there would often be a reunion in mrs mooney’s front drawing-

room. the music-hall artistes would oblige; and sheridan played waltzes and polkas and vamped accompaniments. polly mooney, the madam’s daughter, would also sing. she sang:
           i’m a ... naughty girl.
             you needn’t sham:
             you know i am.
polly was a slim girl of nineteen; she had light soft hair and a small full mouth. her eyes, which were grey with a shade of green through them, had a habit of glancing upwards when she spoke with anyone, which made her look like a little perverse madonna. mrs mooney had first sent her daughter to be a typist in a corn-factor’s office but, as a

disreputable sheriff’s man used to come every other day to the office, asking to be allowed to say a word to his daughter, she had taken her daughter home again and set her to do housework. as polly was very lively the intention was to give her the run of the young men. besides, young men like to feel that there is a young woman not very far away. polly, of course, flirted with the young men but mrs mooney, who was a shrewd judge, knew that the young men were only passing the time away: none of them meant business. things went on so for a long time and mrs mooney began to think of sending polly back to typewriting when she noticed that something was going on between polly and one of the young men. she watched the pair and kept her own counsel.
polly knew that she was being watched, but still her mother’s persistent silence could not be misunderstood. there had been no open complicity between mo

ther and daughter, no open understanding but, though people in the house began to talk of the affair, still mrs mooney did not intervene. polly began to grow a little strange in her manner and the young man was evidently perturbed. at last, when she judged it to be the right moment, mrs mooney intervened. she dealt with moral problems as a cleaver deals with meat: and in this case she had made up her mind.
it was a bright sunday morning of early summer, promising heat, but with a fresh breeze blowing. all the windows of the boarding house were open and the lace curtains ballooned gently towards the street beneath the raised sashes. the belfry of george’s church sent out constant peals and worshippers, singly or in groups, traversed the little circus before the church, revealing the

ir purpose by their self-contained demeanour no less than by the little volumes in their gloved hands. breakfast was over in the boarding house and the table of the breakfast-room was covered with plates on which lay yellow streaks of eggs with morsels of bacon-fat and bacon-rind. mrs mooney sat in the straw arm-chair and watched the servant mary remove the breakfast things. she made mary collect the crusts and pieces of broken bread to help to make tuesday’s bread-pudding. when the table was cleared, the broken bread collected, the sugar and butter safe under lock and key, she began to reconstruct the interview which she had had the night before with polly. things were as she had suspected: she had been frank in her questions and polly had been frank in her answers. both had bee

n somewhat awkward, of course. she had been made awkward by her not wishing to receive the news in too cavalier a fashion or to seem to have connived and polly had been made awkward not merely because allusions of that kind always made her awkward but also because she did not wish it to be thought that in her wise innocence she had divined the intention behind her mother’s tolerance.
mrs mooney glanced instinctively at the little gilt clock on the mantelpiece as soon as she had become aware through her revery that the bells of george’s church had stopped ringing. it was seventeen minutes past eleven: she would have lots of time to have the matter out with mr doran and then catch short twelve at marlborough street. she was sure she would win. to begin with she had all the weight of social opinion on her side: she was an outraged mother. she had allowed him to live beneath her roof, a

 be all right, never fear. he left her crying on the bed and moaning softly: “o my god!”
going down the stairs his glasses became so dimmed with moisture that he had to take them off and polish them. he longed to ascend through the roof and fly away to another country where he would never hear again of his trouble, and yet a force pushed him downstairs step by step. the implacable faces of his employer and of the madam stared upon his discomfiture. on the last flight of stairs he passed jack mooney who was coming up from the pantry nursing two bottles of bass. they saluted coldly; and the lover’s eyes rested for a second or two on a thick bulldog face and a pair of thick short arms. when he reached the foot of the staircase he glanced up and saw jack regarding him from the door of the return-room.
suddenly he remembered the night when one of the music-hall artistes, a little blond londoner, had made a rather free allusion to polly. the reunion had been almost broken up on account of jac

 at tea. maria had cut them herself.
maria was a very, very small person indeed but she had a very long nose and a very long chin. she talked a little through her nose, always soothingly: “yes, my dear,” and “no, my dear.” she was always sent for when the women quarrelled over their tubs and always succeeded in making peace. one day the matron had said to her:
“maria, you are a veritable peace-maker!”
and the sub-matron and two of the board ladies had heard the compliment. and ginger mooney was always saying what she wouldn’t do to the dummy who had charge of the irons if it wasn’t for maria. everyone was so fond of maria.
the women would have their tea at six o’clock and she would be able to get away before seven. from ballsbridge to the pillar, twenty minutes; from the pillar to drumcondra, twenty minutes; and twenty minutes to buy the things. she would be there before eight. she took out her purse with the silver clasps and read again the words a present from belfast. she

huge tin cans. maria superintended the distribution of the barmbrack and saw that every woman got her four slices. there was a great deal of laughing and joking during the meal. lizzie fleming said maria was sure to get the ring and, though fleming had said that for so many hallow eves, maria had to laugh and say she didn’t want any ring or man either; and when she laughed her grey-green eyes sparkled with disappointed shyness and the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin. then ginger mooney lifted up her mug of tea and proposed maria’s health while all the other women clattered with their mugs on the table, and said she was sorry she hadn’t a sup of porter to drink it in. and maria laughed again till the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin and till her minute body nearly shook itself asunder because she knew that mooney meant well though, of course, she had the notions of a common woman.
but wasn’t maria glad when the women had finished their tea and the cook and
