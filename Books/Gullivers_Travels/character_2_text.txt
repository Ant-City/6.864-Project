a great storm described; the long boat sent to fetch water; the author
goes with it to discover the country.  he is left on shore, is seized by
one of the natives, and carried to a farmer’s house.  his reception, with
several accidents that happened there.  a description of the inhabitants.

having been condemned, by nature and fortune, to active and restless
life, in two months after my return, i again left my native country, and
took shipping in the downs, on the 20th day of june, 1702, in the
adventure, captain john nicholas, a cornish man, commander, bound for
surat.  we had a very prosperous gale, till we arrived at the cape of
good hope, where we landed for fresh water;

n me as a curiosity, much wondering to hear me pronounce
articulate words, although he could not understand them.  in the mean
time i was not able to forbear groaning and shedding tears, and turning
my head towards my sides; letting him know, as well as i could, how
cruelly i was hurt by the pressure of his thumb and finger.  he seemed to
apprehend my meaning; for, lifting up the lappet of his coat, he put me
gently into it, and immediately ran along with me to his master, who was
a substantial farmer, and the same person i had first seen in the field.

the farmer having (as i suppose by their talk) received such an account
of me as his servant could give him, took a piece of a small straw, about
the size of a walking-staff, and therewith lifted up the lappets of my
coat; which it seems he thought to be some kind of covering that nature
had given me.  he blew my hairs aside to take a better view of my face.
he called his hinds about him, and asked them, as i afterwards learned,
whether they

had ever seen in the fields any little creature that
resembled me.  he then placed me softly on the ground upon all fours, but
i got immediately up, and walked slowly backward and forward, to let
those people see i had no intent to run away.  they all sat down in a
circle about me, the better to observe my motions.  i pulled off my hat,
and made a low bow towards the farmer.  i fell on my knees, and lifted up
my hands and eyes, and spoke several words as loud as i could: i took a
purse of gold out of my pocket, and humbly presented it to him.  he
received it on the palm of his hand, then applied it close to his eye to
see what it was, and afterwards turned it several times with the point of
a pin (which he took out of his sleeve,) but could make nothing of it.
whereupon i made a sign that he should place his hand on the ground.  i
then took the purse, and, opening

 it, poured all the gold into his palm.
there were six spanish pieces of four pistoles each, beside twenty or
thirty smaller coins.  i saw him wet the tip of his little finger upon
his tongue, and take up one of my largest pieces, and then another; but
he seemed to be wholly ignorant what they were.  he made me a sign to put
them again into my purse, and the purse again into my pocket, which,
after offering it to him several times, i thought it best to do.

the farmer, by this time, was convinced i must be a rational creature.
he spoke often to me; but the sound of his voice pierced my ears like
that of a water-mill, yet his words were articulate enough.  i answered
as loud as i could in several languages, and he often laid his ear within
two yards of me: but all in vain, for we were wholly unintelligible to
each other.  he then sent his servants to their work, and taking his
handkerchief out of his pocket, he doubled and spread it on his left
hand, which he

ed me to her; but she screamed and ran back, as women in england do
at the sight of a toad or a spider.  however, when she had a while seen
my behaviour, and how well i observed the signs her husband made, she was
soon reconciled, and by degrees grew extremely tender of me.

it was about twelve at noon, and a servant brought in dinner.  it was
only one substantial dish of meat (fit for the plain condition of a
husbandman,) in a dish of about four-and-twenty feet diameter.  the
company were, the farmer and his wife, three children, and an old
grandmother.  when they were sat down, the farmer placed me at some
distance from him on the table, which was thirty feet high from the
floor.  i was in a terrible fright, and kept as far as i could from the
edge, for fear of falling.  the wife minced a bit of meat, then crumbled
some bread on a trencher, and placed it before me.  i made her a low bow,
took out my knife and fork, and fell to eat, which gave them exceeding
delight.  the mistress sent her

 true by experience in my travels, that flying or
discovering fear before a fierce animal, is a certain way to make it
pursue or attack you, so i resolved, in this dangerous juncture, to show
no manner of concern.  i walked with intrepidity five or six times before
the very head of the cat, and came within half a yard of her; whereupon
she drew herself back, as if she were more afraid of me: i had less
apprehension concerning the dogs, whereof three or four came into the
room, as it is usual in farmers’ houses; one of which was a mastiff,
equal in bulk to four elephants, and another a greyhound, somewhat taller
than the mastiff, but not so large.

when dinner was almost done, the nurse came in with a child of a year old
in her arms, who immediately spied me, and began a squall that you might
have heard from london-bridge to chelsea, after the usual oratory of
infants, to get me for a plaything.  the mother, out of pure indulgence,
took me up, and put me towards the child, who presently sei

ursing of the ladies in that
emperor’s court, he used to tell me, “one had freckles; another too wide
a mouth; a third too large a nose;” nothing of which i was able to
distinguish.  i confess this reflection was obvious enough; which,
however, i could not forbear, lest the reader might think those vast
creatures were actually deformed: for i must do them the justice to say,
they are a comely race of people, and particularly the features of my
master’s countenance, although he was but a farmer, when i beheld him
from the height of sixty feet, appeared very well proportioned.

when dinner was done, my master went out to his labourers, and, as i
could discover by his voice and gesture, gave his wife strict charge to
take care of me.  i was very much tired, and disposed to sleep, which my
mistress perceiving, she put me on her own bed, and covered me with a
clean white handkerchief, but larger and coarser than the mainsail of a
man-of-war.

i slept about two hours, and dreamt i was at h

on my mind, and is so deeply fixed in my memory, that, in committing it
to paper i did not omit one material circumstance: however, upon a strict
review, i blotted out several passages.  of less moment which were in my

a description of the farmer’s daughter.  the author carried to a
market-town, and then to the metropolis.  the particulars of his journey.

my mistress had a daughter of nine years old, a child of towardly parts
for her age, very dexterous at her needle, and skilful in dressing her
baby.  her mother and she contrived to fit up the baby’s cradle for me
against night: the cradle was put into a small drawer of a cabinet, and
the drawer placed upon a hanging shelf for fear of the rats.  this was my
bed all the time i stai

master had found a strange animal in the field, about the bigness of a
_splacnuck_, but exactly shaped in every part like a human creature;
which it likewise imitated in all its actions; seemed to speak in a
little language of its own, had already learned several words of theirs,
went erect upon two legs, was tame and gentle, would come when it was
called, do whatever it was bid, had the finest limbs in the world, and a
complexion fairer than a nobleman’s daughter of three years old.  another
farmer, who lived hard by, and was a particular friend of my master, came
on a visit on purpose to inquire into the truth of this story.  i was
immediately produced, and placed upon a table, where i walked as i was
commanded, drew my hanger, put it up again, made my reverence to my
master’s guest, asked him in his own language how he did, and told him
_he was welcome_, just as my little nurse had instructed me.  this man,
who was old and dim-sighted, put on his spectacles to behold me better;

bet, and could
make a shift to explain a sentence here and there; for glumdalclitch had
been my instructor while we were at home, and at leisure hours during our
journey.  she carried a little book in her pocket, not much larger than a
sanson’s atlas; it was a common treatise for the use of young girls,
giving a short account of their religion: out of this she taught me my
letters, and interpreted the words.



chapter iii.


the author sent for to court.  the queen buys him of his master the
farmer, and presents him to the king.  he disputes with his majesty’s
great scholars.  an apartment at court provided for the author.  he is in
high favour with the queen.  he stands up for the honour of his own
country.  his quarrels with the queen’s dwarf.

the frequent labours i underwent every day, made, in a few weeks, a very
considerable change in my health: the more my master got by me, the more
insatiable he grew.  i had quite lost my stomach, and was almost reduced
to a skeleton.  the far

country and europe, and the high price of gold among them, was hardly so
great a sum as a thousand guineas would be in england.  i then said to
the queen, “since i was now her majesty’s most humble creature and
vassal, i must beg the favour, that glumdalclitch, who had always tended
me with so much care and kindness, and understood to do it so well, might
be admitted into her service, and continue to be my nurse and
instructor.”

her majesty agreed to my petition, and easily got the farmer’s consent,
who was glad enough to have his daughter preferred at court, and the poor
girl herself was not able to hide her joy.  my late master withdrew,
bidding me farewell, and saying he had left me in a good service; to
which i replied not a word, only making him a slight bow.

the queen observed my coldness; and, when the farmer was gone out of the
apartment, asked me the reason.  i made bold to tell her majesty, “that i
owed no other obligation to my late master, than his not dashing o

 his astonishment.  he
was by no means satisfied with the relation i gave him of the manner i
came into his kingdom, but thought it a story concerted between
glumdalclitch and her father, who had taught me a set of words to make me
sell at a better price.  upon this imagination, he put several other
questions to me, and still received rational answers: no otherwise
defective than by a foreign accent, and an imperfect knowledge in the
language, with some rustic phrases which i had learned at the farmer’s
house, and did not suit the polite style of a court.

his majesty sent for three great scholars, who were then in their weekly
waiting, according to the custom in that country.  these gentlemen, after
they had a while examined my shape with much nicety, were of different
opinions concerning me.  they all agreed that i could not be produced
according to the regular laws of nature, because i was not framed with a
capacity of preserving my life, either by swiftness, or climbing of
trees, or di

applied myself to the king, and assured his majesty, “that i came from a
country which abounded with several millions of both sexes, and of my own
stature; where the animals, trees, and houses, were all in proportion,
and where, by consequence, i might be as able to defend myself, and to
find sustenance, as any of his majesty’s subjects could do here; which i
took for a full answer to those gentlemen’s arguments.”  to this they
only replied with a smile of contempt, saying, “that the farmer had
instructed me very well in my lesson.”  the king, who had a much better
understanding, dismissing his learned men, sent for the farmer, who by
good fortune was not yet gone out of town.  having therefore first
examined him privately, and then confronted him with me and the young
girl, his majesty began to think that what we told him might possibly be
true. he desired the queen to order that a particular care should be
taken of me; and was of opinion that glumdalclitch should still continu

se kept in her pocket in a silver box, and gave me at meals as
i wanted them, always cleaning them herself.  no person dined with the
queen but the two princesses royal, the eldest sixteen years old, and the
younger at that time thirteen and a month.  her majesty used to put a bit
of meat upon one of my dishes, out of which i carved for myself, and her
diversion was to see me eat in miniature: for the queen (who had indeed
but a weak stomach) took up, at one mouthful, as much as a dozen english
farmers could eat at a meal, which to me was for some time a very
nauseous sight.  she would craunch the wing of a lark, bones and all,
between her teeth, although it were nine times as large as that of a
full-grown turkey; and put a bit of bread into her mouth as big as two
twelve-penny loaves.  she drank out of a golden cup, above a hogshead at
a draught.  her knives were twice as long as a scythe, set straight upon
the handle.  the spoons, forks, and other instruments, were all in the

 was spread, of drawing
lectures in morality, or indeed rather matter of discontent and repining,
from the quarrels we raise with nature.  and i believe, upon a strict
inquiry, those quarrels might be shown as ill-grounded among us as they
are among that people.

as to their military affairs, they boast that the king’s army consists of
a hundred and seventy-six thousand foot, and thirty-two thousand horse:
if that may be called an army, which is made up of tradesmen in the
several cities, and farmers in the country, whose commanders are only the
nobility and gentry, without pay or reward.  they are indeed perfect
enough in their exercises, and under very good discipline, wherein i saw
no great merit; for how should it be otherwise, where every farmer is
under the command of his own landlord, and every citizen under that of
the principal men in his own city, chosen after the manner of venice, by
ballot?

“that his excellency’s prudence, quality, and fortune, had exempted him
from those defects, which folly and beggary had produced in others.”  he
said, “if i would go with him to his country-house, about twenty miles
distant, where his estate lay, there would be more leisure for this kind
of conversation.”  i told his excellency “that i was entirely at his
disposal;” and accordingly we set out next morning.

during our journey he made me observe the several methods used by farmers
in managing their lands, which to me were wholly unaccountable; for,
except in some very few places, i could not discover one ear of corn or
blade of grass.  but, in three hours travelling, the scene was wholly
altered; we came into a most beautiful country; farmers’ houses, at small
distances, neatly built; the fields enclosed, containing vineyards,
corn-grounds, and meadows.  neither do i remember to have seen a more
delightful prospect.  his excellency observed my countenance to clear up;

and when they belonged to persons of quality, were employed in
travelling, racing, or drawing chariots; they were treated with much
kindness and care, till they fell into diseases, or became foundered in
the feet; but then they were sold, and used to all kind of drudgery till
they died; after which their skins were stripped, and sold for what they
were worth, and their bodies left to be devoured by dogs and birds of
prey.  but the common race of horses had not so good fortune, being kept
by farmers and carriers, and other mean people, who put them to greater
labour, and fed them worse.”  i described, as well as i could, our way of
riding; the shape and use of a bridle, a saddle, a spur, and a whip; of
harness and wheels.  i added, “that we fastened plates of a certain hard
substance, called iron, at the bottom of their feet, to preserve their
hoofs from being broken by the stony ways, on which we often travelled.”

my master, after some expressions of great indignation, wondered
