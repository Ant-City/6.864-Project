 ten thousand ways.
  now shake, out thy fruitful breast, the seeds
  of envy, discord, and of cruel deeds:
  confound the peace establish'd, and prepare
  their souls to hatred, and their hands to war."

  smear'd as she was with black gorgonian blood,
  the fury sprang above the stygian flood;
  and on her wicker wings, sublime thro' night,
  she to the latian palace took her flight:
  there sought the queen's apartment, stood before
  the peaceful threshold, and besieg'd the door.
  restless amata lay, her swelling breast
  fir'd with disdain for turnus dispossess'd,
  and the new nuptials of the trojan guest.
  from her black bloody locks the fury shakes
  her darling plague, the fav'rite of her snakes;
  with her full force she threw the poisonous dart,
  and fix'd it deep within amata's heart,
  that, thus envenom'd, she might kindle rage,
  and sacrifice to strife her house husband's age.
  unseen, unfelt, the fiery serpent skims
  betwixt her linen and her naked limbs;
  his baleful

  like fury seiz'd the rest; the progress known,
  all seek the mountains, and forsake the town:
  all, clad in skins of beasts, the jav'lin bear,
  give to the wanton winds their flowing hair,
  and shrieks and shoutings rend the suff'ring air.
  the queen herself, inspir'd with rage divine,
  shook high above her head a flaming pine;
  then roll'd her haggard eyes around the throng,
  and sung, in turnus' name, the nuptial song:
  "io, ye latian dames! if any here
  hold your unhappy queen, amata, dear;
  if there be here," she said, "who dare maintain
  my right, nor think the name of mother vain;
  unbind your fillets, loose your flowing hair,
  and orgies and nocturnal rites prepare."

  amata's breast the fury thus invades,
  and fires with rage, amid the sylvan shades;
  then, when she found her venom spread so far,
  the royal house embroil'd in civil war,
  rais'd on her dusky wings, she cleaves the skies,
  and seeks the palace where young turnus lies.

nd the rest are shown;
  shrieks, clamors, murmurs, fill the frighted town.
  ambitious turnus in the press appears,
  and, aggravating crimes, augments their fears;
  proclaims his private injuries aloud,
  a solemn promise made, and disavow'd;
  a foreign son is sought, and a mix'd mungril brood.
  then they, whose mothers, frantic with their fear,
  in woods and wilds the flags of bacchus bear,
  and lead his dances with dishevel'd hair,
  increase the clamor, and the war demand,
  (such was amata's interest in the land,)
  against the public sanctions of the peace,
  against all omens of their ill success.
  with fates averse, the rout in arms resort,
  to force their monarch, and insult the court.
  but, like a rock unmov'd, a rock that braves
  the raging tempest and the rising waves-
  propp'd on himself he stands; his solid sides
  wash off the seaweeds, and the sounding tides-
  so stood the pious prince, unmov'd, and long
  sustain'd the madness of the noisy throng.
  but, when he

e thrust amid the crowd, securely bold,
  like a fierce tiger pent amid the fold.
  too late his blazing buckler they descry,
  and sparkling fires that shot from either eye,
  his mighty members, and his ample breast,
  his rattling armor, and his crimson crest.

  far from that hated face the trojans fly,
  all but the fool who sought his destiny.
  mad pandarus steps forth, with vengeance vow'd
  for bitias' death, and threatens thus aloud:
  "these are not ardea's walls, nor this the town
  amata proffers with lavinia's crown:
  't is hostile earth you tread. of hope bereft,
  no means of safe return by flight are left."
  to whom, with count'nance calm, and soul sedate,
  thus turnus: "then begin, and try thy fate:
  my message to the ghost of priam bear;
  tell him a new achilles sent thee there."

  a lance of tough ground ash the trojan threw,
  rough in the rind, and knotted as it grew:
  with his full force he whirl'd it first around;

  this arm, this lance, can well dispute the prize;
  and the blood follows, where the weapon flies.
  his goddess mother is not near, to shroud
  the flying coward with an empty cloud."

  but now the queen, who fear'd for turnus' life,
  and loath'd the hard conditions of the strife,
  held him by force; and, dying in his death,
  in these sad accents gave her sorrow breath:
  "o turnus, i adjure thee by these tears,
  and whate'er price amata's honor bears
  within thy breast, since thou art all my hope,
  my sickly mind's repose, my sinking age's prop;
  since on the safety of thy life alone
  depends latinus, and the latian throne:
  refuse me not this one, this only pray'r,
  to waive the combat, and pursue the war.
  whatever chance attends this fatal strife,
  think it includes, in thine, amata's life.
  i cannot live a slave, or see my throne
  usurp'd by strangers or a trojan son."

  at this, a flood of tears lavinia shed;
