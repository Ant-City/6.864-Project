which had brought me to the work of an author quite new to me, called
bergotte, had this definite result that for a long time afterwards
it was not against a wall gay with spikes of purple blossom, but on a
wholly different background, the porch of a gothic cathedral, that i
would see outlined the figure of one of the women of whom i dreamed.

i had heard bergotte spoken of, for the first time, by a friend older
than myself, for whom i had a strong admiration, a precious youth of the
name of bloch. hearing me confess my love of the _nuit d'octobre_, he
had burst out in a bray of laughter, like a bugle-call, and told me,
by way of warning: "you must conquer your vile taste for a. de musset,
esquire. he is a bad egg, one of the very worst, a pretty detestable
specimen. i am bound to admit, natheless," he added graciously, "that
he, and even the man racine, did, each of them, once in his life,
compose a line which is not only fairly rhythmical, but has also what is

magnus_ speaks not falsely, then, by apollo, you may taste, even you, my
master, the ambrosial joys of olympus." it was in an ostensible vein of
sarcasm that he had asked me to call him, and that he himself called me,
"my master." but, as a matter of fact, we each derived a certain amount
of satisfaction from the mannerism, being still at the age in which one
believes that one gives a thing real existence by giving it a name.

unfortunately i was not able to set at rest, by further talks with
bloch, in which i might have insisted upon an explanation, the doubts
he had engendered in me when he told me that fine lines of poetry (from
which i, if you please, expected nothing less than the revelation of
truth itself) were all the finer if they meant absolutely nothing. for,
as it happened, bloch was not invited to the house again. at first, he
had been well received there. it is true that my grandfather made out
that, whenever i formed a strong attachment to any one of my friends and
brought

d been obliged, unconsciously, by my
grandfather's subtle examination, to admit his origin, then my
grandfather, to shew us that he had no longer any doubts, would merely
look at us, humming almost inaudibly the air of


  what! do you hither guide the feet
  of this timid israelite?

or of


  sweet vale of hebron, dear paternal fields,

or, perhaps, of


  yes, i am of the chosen race.

these little eccentricities on my grandfather's part implied no ill-will
whatsoever towards my friends. but bloch had displeased my family for
other reasons. he had begun by annoying my father, who, seeing him come
in with wet clothes, had asked him with keen interest:

"why, m. bloch, is there a change in the weather; has it been raining? i
can't understand it; the barometer has been 'set fair.'"

which drew from bloch nothing more instructive than "sir, i am
absolutely incapable of telling you whether it has rained. i live so
resolutely apart from physical contingencies that my senses no longer
trouble t

o inform me of them."

"my poor boy," said my father after bloch had gone, "your friend is out
of his mind. why, he couldn't even tell me what the weather was like. as
if there could be anything more interesting! he is an imbecile."

next, bloch had displeased my grandmother because, after luncheon, when
she complained of not feeling very well, he had stifled a sob and wiped
the tears from his eyes.

"you cannot imagine that he is sincere," she observed to me. "why he
doesn't know me. unless he's mad, of course."

and finally he had upset the whole household when he arrived an hour
and a half late for luncheon and covered with mud from head to foot, and
made not the least apology, saying merely: "i never allow myself to be

randmother's illness were genuine enough; but they
knew, either instinctively or from their own experience, that our early
impulsive emotions have but little influence over our later actions and
the conduct of our lives; and that regard for moral obligations, loyalty
to our friends, patience in finishing our work, obedience to a rule
of life, have a surer foundation in habits solidly formed and blindly
followed than in these momentary transports, ardent but sterile. they
would have preferred to bloch, as companions for myself, boys who would
have given me no more than it is proper, by all the laws of middle-class
morality, for boys to give one another, who would not unexpectedly
send me a basket of fruit because they happened, that morning, to have
thought of me with affection, but who, since they were incapable of
inclining in my favour, by any single impulse of their imagination and
emotions, the exact balance of the duties and claims of friendship, were
as incapable of loading the scales

 to my prejudice. even the injuries
we do them will not easily divert from the path of their duty towards us
those conventional natures of which my great-aunt furnished a type: who,
after quarrelling for years with a niece, to whom she never spoke again,
yet made no change in the will in which she had left that niece the
whole of her fortune, because she was her next-of-kin, and it was the
'proper thing' to do.

but i was fond of bloch; my parents wished me to be happy; and the
insoluble problems which i set myself on such texts as the 'absolutely
meaningless' beauty of _la fille de minos et de pasiphaÃ«_ tired me more
and made me more unwell than i should have been after further talks with
him, unwholesome as those talks might seem to my mother's mind. and he
would still have been received at combray but for one thing. that same
night, after dinner, having informed me (a piece of news which had a
great influence on my later

life, making it happier at one time and then
more unhappy) that no woman ever thought of anything but love, and that
there was not one of them whose resistance a man could not overcome,
he had gone on to assure me that he had heard it said on unimpeachable
authority that my great-aunt herself had led a 'gay' life in her younger
days, and had been notoriously 'kept.' i could not refrain from passing
on so important a piece of information to my parents; the next time
bloch called he was not admitted, and afterwards, when i met him in the
street, he greeted me with extreme coldness.

but in the matter of bergotte he had spoken truly.

for the first few days, like a tune which will be running in one's head
and maddening one soon enough, but of which one has not for the moment
'got hold,' the things i was to love so passionately in bergotte's style
had not yet caught my eye. i could not, it is true, lay down the novel
of his which i was reading, but i fancied that i

told then that the metaphysicians whom i was actually to
follow there resembled him in nothing, i should have been struck down by
the despair a young lover feels who has sworn lifelong fidelity, when
a friend speaks to him of the other mistresses he will have in time to
come.

one sunday, while i was reading in the garden, i was interrupted by
swann, who had come to call upon my parents.

"what are you reading? may i look? why, it's bergotte! who has been
telling you about him?"

i replied that bloch was responsible.

"oh, yes, that boy i saw here once, who looks so like the bellini
portrait of mahomet ii. it's an astonishing likeness; he has the same
arched eyebrows and hooked nose and prominent cheekbones. when his beard
comes he'll be mahomet himself. anyhow he has good taste, for bergotte
is a charming creature." and seeing how much i seemed to admire
bergotte, swann, who never spoke at all about the people he knew, made
an exception in my favour and said: "i know him well; if you would

sometimes in the afternoon sky a white moon would creep up like a little
cloud, furtive, without display, suggesting an actress who does not have
to 'come on' for a while, and so goes 'in front' in her ordinary
clothes to watch the rest of the company for a moment, but keeps in the
background, not wishing to attract attention to herself. i was glad to
find her image reproduced in books and paintings, though these works of
art were very different--at least in my earlier years, before bloch had
attuned my eyes and mind to more subtle harmonies--from those in
which the moon seems fair to me to-day, but in which i should not have
recognised her then. it might be, for instance, some novel by saintine,
some landscape by gleyre, in which she is cut out sharply against the
sky, in the form of a silver sickle, some work as unsophisticated and
as incomplete as were, at that date, my own impressions, and which it
enraged my grandmother's sisters to see me admire. they held that one

udgments there was no appeal, in the heart of which i was bound,
helpless, without friend or ally, and beyond which no further
possibilities lay concealed. it was evident to me then that i existed in
the same manner as all other men, that i must grow old, that i must die
like them, and that among them i was to be distinguished merely as one
of those who have no aptitude for writing. and so, utterly despondent, i
renounced literature for ever, despite the encouragements that had been
given me by bloch. this intimate, spontaneous feeling, this sense of the
nullity of my intellect, prevailed against all the flattering speeches
that might be lavished upon me, as a wicked man, when everyone is loud
in the praise of his good deeds, is gnawed by the secret remorse of
conscience.

one day my mother said: "you are always talking about mme. de

ill, four years ago, and so she is coming to combray for his daughter's
wedding. you will
