n and then they follow him over to greet us. 

i know chaff by sight because i've spent years watching him pass a bottle back and forth 
with haymitch on television. he's dark skinned, about six feet tall, and one of his arms ends 
in  a  stump  because  he  lost  his  hand  in  the  games  he  won  thirty  years  ago.  i'm  sure  they 
offered  him  some  artificial  replacement,  like  they  did  peeta  when  they  had  to  amputate  his 
lower leg, but i guess he didn't take it. 

the woman, seeder, looks almost like she could be from the seam, with her olive skin and 
straight black hair streaked with silver. only her golden brown eyes mark her as from another 
district. she must be around sixty, but she still looks strong, and there's no sign she's turned to 
liquor or morphling or any other chemical form of escape over the years. before either of us 
says  a  word,  she  embraces  me.  i  know  somehow  it  must  be  because  of  rue  and  thresh. 
before i can stop myself, i whisper,

floor, and then kicks it away in disgust. except for her forest green slippers, she doesn't have 
on a stitch of clothing. â€œthat's better.â€ 

we  end  up  on  the  same  elevator  with  her,  and  she  spends  the  whole  ride  to the  seventh 
floor chatting to peeta about his paintings while the light of his still-glowing costume reflects 
off her bare breasts. when she leaves, i ignore him, but i just know he's grinning. i toss aside 
his  hand  as  the  doors  close  behind  chaff  and  seeder,  leaving  us  alone,  and  he  breaks  out 
laughing. 

â€œwhat?â€ i say, turning on him as we step out on our floor. 

â€œit's you, katniss. can't you see?â€ he says. â€œwhat's me?â€ i say. 

â€œwhy they're all acting like this. finnick with his sugar cubes and chaff kissing you and 
that  whole  thing  with  johanna  stripping  down.â€  he  tries  to  take  on  a  more  serious  tone, 
unsuccessfully. â€œthey're playing with you because you're so ... you know.â€ 

â€œno, i don't know,â€

mpathy and comfort. i haven't changed my mind about saving him in the arena, but i 
don't owe him more than that. 

as i watch the procession to the city circle, i think how it's bad enough that they dress us 
all  up  in  costumes  and  parade  us  through  the  streets  in  chariots  on  a  regular  year.  kids  in 
costumes are silly, but aging victors, it turns out, are pitiful. a few who are on the younger 
side, like johanna and finnick, or whose bodies haven't fallen into disrepair, like seeder and 
brutus, can still manage to maintain a little dignity. but the majority, who are in the clutches 

of drink or morphling or illness,  look grotesque  in their costumes, depicting cows and trees 
and  loaves of  bread. last  year we chattered away  about each contestant, but tonight there's 
only the occasional comment. small wonder the crowd goes wild when peeta and i appear, 
looking so young and strong and beautiful in our brilliant costumes. the very image of what 
tributes should be.

t it? to train like careers?â€ counters haymitch. â€œand who 
makes up the career pack is generally agreed upon before the games begin. peeta barely got 
in with them last year.â€ 

i think of the loathing i felt when i discovered peeta was with the careers during the last 

games. â€œso we're to try to get in with finnick and brutus â€” is that what you're saying?â€ 

â€œnot necessarily. everyone's a  victor. make  your own pack  if  you'd rather. choose who 
you like. i'd suggest chaff and seeder. although finnick's not to be ignored,â€ says haymitch. 
â€œfind someone to team up with who might be of some use to you. remember, you're not in a 
ring  full of trembling children  anymore. these people  are all experienced killers,  no  matter 
what shape they appear to be in.â€ 

maybe he's right. only who could i trust? seeder maybe. but do  i really want to make a 
pact with her, only to possibly have to kill her later? no. still, i made a pact with rue under 
the same circumstances. i

an arrow at them during my private training 
session.â€  beetee  and  wiress  look  at  me  curiously.  â€œi  was  provoked.  so,  do  all  force  fields 
have a spot like that?â€ 

â€œchink,â€ says wiress vaguely. 

â€œin the armor, as it were,â€ finishes beetee. â€œideally it'd be invisible, wouldn't it?â€ 

i want to ask them more, but lunch is announced. i look for peeta, but he's hanging with a 
group of about ten other victors, so i decide just to eat with district 3. maybe i can get seeder 
to join us. 

when we make our way into the dining area, i see some of peeta's gang have other ideas. 
they're  dragging  all  the  smaller  tables  to  form  one  large  table  so  that  we  all  have  to  eat 
together. now i don't know what to do. even at school i used to avoid eating at a crowded 
table.  frankly,  i'd  probably  have  sat  alone  if  madge  hadn't  made  a  habit  of  joining  me.  i 

guess  i'd  have  eaten  with  gale  except,  being  two  grades  apart,  our  lunch

augh about it.â€ 

â€œforget it,â€ i say with a shake of my head. â€œit's a lot of things.â€ 

â€œdarius,â€ he says. 

â€œdarius. the games. haymitch making us team up with the others,â€ i say. 

â€œit can just be you and me, you know,â€ he says. 

â€œi know. but maybe haymitch is right,â€ i say. â€œdon't tell him i said so, but he usually is, 

where the games are concerned.â€ 

â€œwell,  you  can  have  final  say  about our  allies.  but right  now,  i'm  leaning  toward  chaff 

and seeder,â€ says peeta. 

â€œi'm okay with seeder, not chaff,â€ i say. â€œnot yet, anyway.â€ 

â€œcome on and eat with him. i promise, i won't let him kiss you again,â€ says peeta. 

chaff doesn't seem as bad at lunch. he's sober, and while he talks too loud and makes bad 
jokes  a  lot,  most  of  them  are  at  his  own  expense.  i  can  see  why  he  would  be  good  for 
haymitch, whose thoughts run so darkly. but i'm still not sure i'm ready to team up with him. 

i try hard to be more sociabl

ervous,  twitchy  way,  wondering  if  it's  been  fully  examined  by  experts  of 
late. finnick recites a poem he wrote to his one true love in the capitol, and about a hundred 
people faint because they're sure he means them. by the time johanna mason gets up, she's 
asking if something can't be done about the situation. surely the creators of the quarter quell 
never anticipated such love forming between the victors and the capitol. no one could be so 

cruel as to sever such a deep bond. seeder quietly ruminates about how, back in district 11, 
everyone  assumes  president  snow  is  all-powerful.  so  if  he's  all-powerful,  why  doesn't  he 
change  the  quell?  and  chaff,  who  comes  right  on  her  heels,  insists  the  president  could 
change the quell if he wanted to, but he must not think it matters much to anyone. 

by the time i'm introduced, the audience is an absolute wreck. people have been weeping 
and  collapsing  and  even  calling  for  change.  the  sight  of  me

t it turns out to be 
plenty hard for me as well. seeing the faces of the eight dead victors projected into the sky. 

the  man  from district 5, the one finnick took out with his trident, is the  first to  appear. 
that  means  that  all  the  tributes  in  1  through  4  are  alive  â€”  the  four  careers,  beetee  and 
wiress, and, of course, mags and finnick. the man from district 5 is followed by the male 
morphling  from 6, cecelia and  woof  from 8, both  from 9, the woman  from 10, and seeder 
from 11. the capitol seal is back with a final bit of music and then the sky goes dark except 
for the moon. 

no one speaks. i can't pretend i knew  any of them well. but i'm thinking of those three 
kids hanging on to cecelia when they took her away. seeder's kindness to me at our meeting. 
even the thought of the glazed-eyed morphling painting my cheeks with yellow flowers gives 
me a pang. all dead. all gone. 

i  don't  know  how  long  we  might  have  sat  here  if  it  weren't  for  th
