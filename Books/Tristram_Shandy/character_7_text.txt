my uncle toby,--taking, as i told you, his pipe from his mouth, and
striking the ashes out of it as he began his sentence;--i think, replied
he,--it would not be amiss, brother, if we rung the bell.

pray, what's all that racket over our heads, obadiah?--quoth my
father;--my brother and i can scarce hear ourselves speak.

sir, answered obadiah, making a bow towards his left shoulder,--my
mistress is taken very badly.--and where's susannah running down the
garden there, as if they were going to ravish her?--sir, she is running
the shortest cut into the town, replied obadiah, to fetch the old
midwife.--then saddle a horse, quoth my father, and do you go directly
for dr. slop, the man-midwife, with all our services,--and let him know
your mistress is fallen into labour--and that i desire he will return
with you with all speed.

it is very strange, says my father, addressing himself to my uncle toby,
as obadiah shut the door,--as th

the hypothesis is, like most of my father's, singular and ingenious
too;--nor have i any objection to it, but that it overturns my own.



chapter 2.vi.

--bless my soul!--my poor mistress is ready to faint--and her pains are
gone--and the drops are done--and the bottle of julap is broke--and the
nurse has cut her arm--(and i, my thumb, cried dr. slop,) and the
child is where it was, continued susannah,--and the midwife has fallen
backwards upon the edge of the fender, and bruised her hip as black as
your hat.--i'll look at it, quoth dr slop.--there is no need of that,
replied susannah,--you had better look at my mistress--but the midwife
would gladly first give you an account how things are, so desires you
would go up stairs and speak to her this moment.

human nature is the same in all professions.

and his bitter imprecation about them, he was just beginning to

when trim's answer, in an instant, tore the laurel from his brows, and
twisted it to pieces.



chapter 2.xx.

--this unfortunate draw-bridge of yours, quoth my father--god bless your
honour, cried trim, 'tis a bridge for master's nose.--in bringing him
into the world with his vile instruments, he has crushed his nose,
susannah says, as flat as a pancake to his face, and he is making a
false bridge with a piece of cotton and a thin piece of whalebone out of
susannah's stays, to raise it up.

--lead me, brother toby, cried my father, to my room this instant.

my father, drawing his leg back and turning to my uncle toby--was the

greatest lawgiver--the greatest philosopher--and the greatest
priest--and engineer--said my uncle toby.

--in course, said my father.



chapter 2.xlvii.

--and how does your mistress? cried my father, taking the same step over
again from the landing, and calling to susannah, whom he saw passing
by the foot of the stairs with a huge pin-cushion in her hand--how does
your mistress? as well, said susannah, tripping by, but without looking
up, as can be expected.--what a fool am i! said my father, drawing his
leg back again--let things be as they will, brother toby, 'tis ever the
precise answer--and how is the child, pray?--no answer. and where is
dr. slop? added my father, raising his voice aloud, and looking over the
ballusters--susannah was out of hearing.

susannah.--there is not a moment's time to dress you, sir, cried
susannah--the child is as black in the face as my--as your what? said
my father, for like all orators, he was a dear searcher into
comparisons.--bless, me, sir, said susannah, the child's in a fit.--and
where's mr. yorick?--never where he should be, said susannah, but his

the child was expiring, one might as well compliment my brother toby as
not--and it would be a pity, in such a case, to throw away so great a
name as trismegistus upon him--but he may recover.

no, no,--said my father to susannah, i'll get up--there is no time,
cried susannah, the child's as black as my shoe. trismegistus, said my
father--but stay--thou art a leaky vessel, susannah, added my father;
canst thou carry trismegistus in thy head, the length of the gallery
without scattering?--can i? cried susannah, shutting the door in a
huff.--if she can, i'll be shot, said my father, bouncing out of bed in
the dark, and groping for his breeches.

susannah ran with all speed along the gallery.

my father made all possible speed to find his breeches.

susannah got the start, and kept it--'tis tris--something, cried
susannah--there is no christian-name in the world, said the cu

susannah.

--there is no gistus to it, noodle!--'tis my own name, replied the
curate, dipping his hand, as he spoke, into the bason--tristram! said
he, &c. &c. &c. &c.--so tristram was i called, and tristram shall i be
to the day of my death.

my father followed susannah, with his night-gown across his arm, with
nothing more than his breeches on, fastened through haste with but a
single button, and that button through haste thrust only half into the
button-hole.

--she has not forgot the name, cried my father, half opening the
door?--no, no, said the curate, with a tone of intelligence.--and the
child is better, cried susannah.--and how does your mistress? as well,
said susannah, as can be expected.--pish! said my father, the button

following favourite chapters, that is, my chapter of chamber-maids, my
chapter of pishes, and my chapter of button-holes.

be dress'd and brought down to us, whilst you and i are getting our
breakfasts together.--

--go, tell susannah, obadiah, to step here.

she is run up stairs, answered obadiah, this very instant, sobbing and
crying, and wringing her hands as if her heart would break.

we shall have a rare month of it, said my father, turning his head from
obadiah, and looking wistfully in my uncle toby's face for some time--we
shall have a devilish month of it, brother toby, said my father,
setting his arms a'kimbo, and shaking his head; fire, water, women,
wind--brother toby!--'tis some misfortune, quoth my uncle toby.-

and riding triumph in every corner of a gentleman's house--little

whistling over our heads.--

and what's the matter, susannah? they have called the child
tristram--and my mistress is just got out of an hysterick fit
about it--no!--'tis not my fault, said susannah--i told him it was
tristram-gistus.

hat--but how different from the sallies and agitations of voice and
members which a common reader would imagine!

--for he spake in the sweetest modulation--and took down his hat with
the genteelest movement of limbs, that ever affliction harmonized and
attuned together.

my uncle toby, and it gives me great concern.--i am heartily concerned

to believe, that it was not in the least owing to me.--to

susannah's and the curate's folly betwixt them.--what business could
they have together, an' please your honour, in the garden?--in the

trim found he was upon a wrong scent, and stopped short with a low
bow--two misfortunes, quoth the corporal to himself, are twice as many

chapter 3.vii.

--my young master in london is dead? said obadiah.--

--a green sattin night-gown of my mother's, which had been twice
scoured, was the first idea which obadiah's exclamation brought
into susannah's head.--well might locke write a chapter upon the
imperfections of words.--then, quoth susannah, we must all go into
mourning.--but note a second time: the word mourning, notwithstanding
susannah made use of it herself--failed also of doing its office; it
excited not one single idea, tinged either with grey or black,--all was
green.--the green sattin night-gown hung there still.

--o! 'twill be the death of my poor mistress, cried susannah.--my
mother's whole wardrobe followed.--what a process

up again,' said susannah.

we had a fat, foolish scullion--my father, i think, kept her for her
simplicity;--she had been all autumn struggling with a dropsy.--he
is dead, said obadiah,--he is certainly dead!--so am not i, said the
foolish scullion.

--here is sad news, trim, cried susannah, wiping her eyes as trim
stepp'd into the kitchen,--master bobby is dead and buried--the funeral
was an interpolation of susannah's--we shall have all to go into
mourning, said susannah.

i hope not, said trim.--you hope not! cried

susannah earnestly.--the
mourning ran not in trim's head, whatever it did in susannah's.--i
hope--said trim, explaining himself, i hope in god the news is not true.
i heard the letter read with my own ears, answered obadiah; and we shall
have a terrible piece of work of it in stubbing the ox-moor.--oh! he's
dead, said susannah.--as sure, said the scullion, as i'm alive.

i lament for him from my heart and my soul, said trim, fetching a
sigh.--poor creature!--poor boy!--poor gentleman!

--he was alive last whitsontide! said the coachman.--whitsontide! alas!
cried trim, extending his right arm, and falling instantly into the same
attitude in which he read the sermon,--what is whitsontide, jonathan

past, to this? are we not here now, continued the co

of health and stability)--and are we not--(dropping his hat upon the
ground) gone! in a moment!--'twas infinitely striking! susannah burst
into a flood of tears.--we are not stocks and stones.--jonathan,
obadiah, the cook-maid, all melted.--the foolish fat scullion herself,
who was scouring a fish-kettle upon her knees, was rous'd with it.--the
whole kitchen crowded about the corporal.

now, as i perceive plainly, that the preservation of our constitution in
church and state,--and possibly the preservation of the whole world--or
what is the same thing, the distribution and balance of its property and
power, may in time to co

--'are we not here now;' continued the corporal, 'and are we
not'--(dropping his hat plumb upon the ground--and pausing, before he
pronounced the word)--'gone! in a moment?' the descent of the hat was as
if a heavy lump of clay had been kneaded into the crown of it.--nothing
could have expressed the sentiment of mortality, of which it was the
type and fore-runner, like it,--his hand seemed to vanish from under
it,--it fell dead,--the corporal's eye fixed upon it, as upon a
corpse,--and susannah burst into a flood of tears.

now--ten thousand, and ten thousand times ten thousand (for matter and
motion are infinite) are the ways by which a hat may be dropped upon the
ground, without any effect.--had he flung it, or thrown it, or cast it,
or skimmed it, or squirted it, or let it slip or fall in any possible
direction under heaven,--or in the best direction that could be given
to it,--had he dropped it like a goose--like a puppy--like an ass--or in
doing it, or even after he had done, had

jonathan, who know what death is, and what havock and destruction he
can make, before a man can well wheel about--'tis like a whole age.--o
jonathan! 'twould make a good-natured man's heart bleed, to consider,
continued the corporal (standing perpendicularly), how low many a brave
and upright fellow has been laid since that time!--and trust me, susy,
added the corporal, turning to susannah, whose eyes were swimming in
water,--before that time comes round again,--many a bright eye will be
dim.--susannah placed it to the right side of the page--she wept--but
she court'sied too.--are we not, continued trim, looking still at
susannah--are we not like a flower of the field--a tear of pride stole
in betwixt every two tears of humiliation--else no tongue could
have described susannah's affliction--is not all flesh grass?--tis
clay,--'tis dirt.--they all looked directly at the scullion,-

scullion had just been scouring a fish-kettle.--it was not fair.--

--what is the finest face that ever man looked at!--i could hear trim

upon trim's shoulder)--but corruption?--susannah took it off.

now i love you for this--and 'tis this delicious mixture within you
which makes you dear creatures what you are--and he who hates you for
it--all i can say of the matter is--that he has either a pumpkin for his
head--or a pippin for his heart,--and whenever he is dissected 'twill be

obadiah, at all in the field.--but he's very frightful in a house, quoth
obadiah.--i never mind it myself, said jonathan, upon a coach-box.--it
must, in my opinion, be most natural in bed, replied susannah.--and
could i escape him by creeping into the worst calf's skin that ever
was made into a knapsack, i would do it there--said trim--but that is
nature.

--nature is nature, said jonathan.--and that is the reason, cried
susannah, i so much pity my mistress.--she will never get the better of
it.--now i pity the captain the most of any one in the family, answered
trim.--madam will get ease of heart in weeping,--and the squire in
talking about it,--but my poor master will keep it all in silence to

it, trim, my master would say,--'tis so melancholy an accident--i cannot
get it off my heart.--your honour fears not death yourself.--i hope,
trim, i fear nothing, he would say, but the doing a wrong thing.--well,
he would add, whatever betides, i will take care of le fever's boy.--and
with that, like a quieting draught, his honour would fall asleep.

i like to hear trim's stories about the captain, said susannah.--he is
a kindly-hearted gentleman, said obadiah, as ever lived.--aye, and
as brave a one too, said the corporal, as ever stept before a
platoon.--there never was a better officer in the king's army,--or
a better man in god's world; for he would march up to the mouth of a
cannon, though he saw the lighted match at the very touch-hole,--and
yet, for all that, he has a heart as soft as a child for other
people.--he would not hurt a chicken.--i would sooner, quoth jonathan,

shilling of it to the captain.--trim could not refrain from tears at
this testamentary proof he gave of his affection to his master.--the
whole kitchen was affected.--do tell us the story of the poor
lieutenant, said susannah.--with all my heart, answered the corporal.

susannah, the cook, jonathan, obadiah, and corporal trim, formed a
circle about the fire; and as soon as the scullion had shut the kitchen
door,--the corporal begun.

'twould provoke a stone, to see how things are carried on in this
world!--the chamber-maid had left no .......... under the bed:--cannot

hand, as she spoke, and helping me up into the window-seat with
the other,--cannot you manage, my dear, for a single time,

i was five years old.--susannah did not consider that nothing was well
hung in our family,--so slap came the sash down like lightning upon
us;--nothing is left,--cried susannah,--nothing is left--for me, but to
run my country.--my uncle toby's house was a much kinder sanctuary; and
so susannah fled to it.



chapter 3.xvi

ii.

when susannah told the corporal the misadventure of the sash, with
all the circumstances which attended the murder of me,--(as she called
it,)--the blood forsook his cheeks,--all accessaries in murder being
principals,--trim's conscience told him he was as much to blame as
susannah,--and if the doctrine had been true, my uncle toby had as much
of the bloodshed to answer for to heaven, as either of 'em;--so that
neither reason or instinct, separate or together, could possibly have
guided susannah's steps to so proper an asylum. it is in vain to leave
this to the reader's imagination:--to form any kind of hypothesis that
will render these propositions feasible, he must cudgel his brains
sore,--and to do it without,--he must have such brains as no reader ever
had before him.--why should i put them either to trial or to torture?
'tis my own affair: i'll explain it myself.



chapter 3.xix.

'tis a pity, trim, said my uncle toby, resting with his hand upon the
corporal's shoulder, as they b

began with the pullies,--and the pullies being picked out, then the lead
became useless,--and so the lead went to pot too.

--a great moral might be picked handsomely out of this, but i have not
time--'tis enough to say, wherever the demolition began, 'twas equally
fatal to the sash window.



chapter 3.xx.

the corporal had not taken his measures so badly in this stroke of
artilleryship, but that he might have kept the matter entirely to
himself, and left susannah to have sustained the whole weight of the
attack, as she could;--true courage is not content with coming
off so.--the corporal, whether as general or comptroller of the
train,--'twas no matter,--had done that, without which, as he imagined,
the misfortune could never have happened,--at least in susannah's
hands;--how would your honours have behaved?--he determined at once,
not to take shelter behind susannah,--but to give it; and with this
resolution upon his mind, he marched upright into the p

trim, by the help of his fore-finger, laid flat upon the table, and the
edge of his hand striking across it at right angles, made a shift to
tell his story so, that priests and virgins might have listened to
it;--and the story being told,--the dialogue went on as follows.



chapter 3.xxi.

--i would be picquetted to death, cried the corporal, as he concluded
susannah's story, before i would suffer the woman to come to any
harm,--'twas my fault, an' please your honour,--not her's.

corporal trim, replied my uncle toby, putting on his hat which lay upon
the table,--if any thing can be said to be a fault, when the service
absolutely requires it should be done,--'tis i certainly who deserve the
blame,--you obeyed your orders.

blow up my fortifications, and my house with them, and we would perish
under their ruins, ere i would stand by and see it.--trim directed a
slight,--but a grateful bow towards his master,--and so the chapter
ends.



chapter 3.xxiii.

--then, yorick, replied my uncle toby, you and i will lead the way
abreast,--and do you, corporal, follow a few paces behind us.--and
susannah, an' please your honour, said trim, shall be put in the
rear.--'twas an excellent disposition,--and in this order, without
either drums beating, or colours flying, they marched slowly from my
uncle toby's house to shandy-hall.

--i wish, said trim, as they entered the door,--instead of the sash
weights, i had cut off the church spout, as i once thought to have
done.--you have cut off spouts enow, replied yorick.

the nursery,--so that susannah had but just time to make her escape down
the back stairs, as my mother came up the fore.

now, though i was old enough to have told the story myself,--and young
enough, i hope, to have done it without malignity; yet susannah, in
passing by the kitchen, for fear of accidents, had left it in short-hand
with the cook--the cook had told it with a commentary to jonathan, and
jonathan to obadiah; so that by the time my father had rung the bell
half a dozen times, to know what was the matter above,--

when the cataplasm was ready, a scruple of decorum had unseasonably rose
up in susannah's conscience, about holding the candle, whilst slop tied
it on; slop had not treated susannah's distemper with anodynes,--and so
a quarrel had ensued betwixt them.

--oh! oh!--said slop, casting a glance of undue freedom in susannah's
face, as she declined the office;--then, i think i know you, madam--you
know me, sir! cried susannah fastidiously, and with a toss of her
head, levelled evidently, not at his profession, but at the doctor
himself,--you know me! cried susannah again.--doctor slop c

finger and his thumb instantly upon his nostrils;--susannah's spleen
was ready to burst at it;--'tis false, said susannah.--come, come, mrs.
modesty, said slop, not a little elated with the success of his last
thrust,--if you won't hold the candle, and look--you may hold it and
shut your eyes:--that's one of your popish shifts, cried susannah:--'tis
better, said slop, with a nod, than no shift at all, young woman;--i
defy you, sir, cried susannah, pulling her shift sleeve below her elbow.

it was almost impossible for two persons to assist each other in a
surgical case with a more splenetic cordiality.

slop snatched up the cataplasm--susannah snatched up the candle;--a
little this way, said slop; susannah looking one way, and rowing
another, instantly set fire to slop's wig, which being somewhat bushy
and unctuous withal, was burnt out before it was well kindled.--you
impudent whore! cried slop,--(for what is passion, but a wild
beast?

said susannah,--which is more than you can say:--is it? cried slop,
throwing the cataplasm in her face;--yes, it is, cried susannah,
returning the compliment with what was left in the pan.



chapter 3.xlvii.

doctor slop and susannah filed cross-bills against each other in the
parlour; which done, as the cataplasm had failed, they retired into the
kitchen to prepare a fomentation for me;--and whilst that was doing, my
father determined the point as you will read.

a series of unmerited mischances had pursued him from that moment,
and trod close upon his heels for four years together after; he had
withstood these buffetings to the last, till sickness overtook him at
marseilles, from whence he wrote my uncle toby word, he had lost his
time, his services, his health, and, in short, every thing but his
sword;--and was waiting for the first ship to return back to him.

as this letter came to hand about six weeks before susannah's accident,
le fever was hourly expected; and was uppermost in my uncle toby's mind
all the time my father was giving him and yorick a description of what
kind of a person he would chuse for a preceptor to me: but as my uncle
toby thought my father at first somewhat fanciful in the accomplishments
he required, he forbore mentioning le fever's name,--till the character,
by yorick's inter-position, ending unexpectedly, in one, who should be
gentle-tempered, and generous, and good, it impressed th

what a jovial and a merry world would this be, may it please your
worships, but for that inextricable labyrinth of debts, cares, woes,
want, grief, discontent, melancholy, large jointures, impositions, and
lies!

doctor slop, like a son of a w..., as my father called him for it,--to
exalt himself,--debased me to death,--and made ten thousand times more
of susannah's accident, than there was any grounds for; so that in a
week's time, or less, it was in every body's mouth, that poor master
shandy...entirely.--and fame, who loves to double every thing,--in
three days more, had sworn, positively she saw it,--and all the world,
as usual, gave credit to her evidence--'that the nursery window had not

brought an action upon the case, and trounced it sufficiently

chapter 3.lxxxii.

as susannah was informed by an express from mrs. bridget, of my
uncle toby's falling in love with her mistress fifteen days before it
happened,--the contents of which express, susannah communicated to my
mother the next day,--it has just given me an opportunity of entering
upon my uncle toby's amours a fortnight before their existence.

i have an article of news to tell you, mr. shandy, quoth my mother,
which will surprise you greatly.--

now my father was then holding one of his second beds of justice, an

of all mortal, and immortal men too, if you please, who ever
soliloquized upon this mystic subject, my uncle toby was the worst
fitted, to have push'd his researches, thro' such a contention of
feelings; and he had infallibly let them all run on, as we do
worse matters, to see what they would turn out--had not bridget's
pre-notification of them to susannah, and susannah's repeated
manifestoes thereupon to all the world, made it necessary for my uncle
toby to look into the affair.

chapter 4.xci.

there will be just time, whilst my uncle toby and trim are walking to
my father's, to inform you that mrs. wadman had, some moons before this,
made a confident of my mother; and that mrs. bridget, who had the burden
of her own, as well as her mistress's secret to carry, had got happily
delivered of both to susannah behind the garden-wall.

as for my mother, she saw nothing at all in it, to make the least bustle
about--but susannah was sufficient by herself for all the ends and
purposes you could possibly have, in exporting a family secret; for she
instantly imparted it by signs to jonathan--and jonathan by tokens to
the cook as she was basting a loin of mutton; the cook sold it with some
kitchen-fat to the postillion for a groat, who truck'd it with the dairy
maid for something of about the same value--an
