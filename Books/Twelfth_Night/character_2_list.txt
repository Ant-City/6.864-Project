Olivia - 
                	A
wealthy, beautiful, and noble Illyrian lady, Olivia is courted by
Orsino and Sir Andrew Aguecheek, but to each of them she insists
that she is in mourning for her brother, who has recently died,
and will not marry for seven years. She and Orsino are similar characters
in that each seems to enjoy wallowing in his or her own misery.
Viola's arrival in the masculine guise of Cesario enables Olivia
to break free of her self-indulgent melancholy. Olivia seems to
have no difficulty transferring her affections from one love interest
to the next, however, suggesting that her romantic feelings--like
most emotions in the play--do not run deep.
