Charles - 
      The Dauphin of France, Charles has himself crowned king and tries to recapture his kingdom from Henry. When he meets the warrior-woman Joan, he engages her in single combat but loses to her. He then wants her to become his lover but she refuses. Charles wins back half his former kingdom after a series of bloody battles, including one in which the English nobleman Talbot dies. However, following this moderate gain, Charles desists in his campaign and agrees to make peace with the English, in order to spare his people from further slaughter.
