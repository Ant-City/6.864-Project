himself, amounting in the whole, to the sum of eighteen shillings and
four pence; so that betwixt them both, the good woman was fully invested
in the real and corporal possession of her office, together with all its
rights, members, and appurtenances whatsoever.

these last words, you must know, were not according to the old form in
which such licences, faculties, and powers usually ran, which in
like cases had heretofore been granted to the sisterhood. but it was
according to a neat formula of didius his own devising, who having a
particular turn for taking to pieces, and new framing over again
all kind of instruments in that way, not only hit upon this dainty
amendment, but coaxed many of the old licensed matrons in the
neighbourhood, to open their faculties afresh, in order to have this
wham-wham of his inserted.

every man to his own taste.--did not dr. kunastrokius, that great man,

now, agalastes (speaking dispraisingly) sayeth, that there may be some
wit in it, for aught he knows--but no judgment at all. and triptolemus
and phutatorius agreeing thereto, ask, how is it possible there should?
for that wit and judgment in this world never go together; inasmuch as
they are two operations differing from each other as wide as east from
west--so, says locke--so are farting and hickuping, say i. but in answer
to this, didius the great church lawyer, in his code de fartendi et
illustrandi fallaciis, doth maintain and make fully appear, that
an illustration is no argument--nor do i maintain the wiping of a
looking-glass clean to be a syllogism;--but you all, may it please your
worships, see the better for it--so that the main good these things do
is only to clarify the understanding, previous to the application of the
argument itself, in order to free it from any little motes, or specks
of opacular matter, which, if

left swimming therein, might hinder a

now, my dear anti-shandeans, and thrice able criticks, and
fellow-labourers (for to you i write this preface)--and to you, most
subtle statesmen and discreet doctors (do--pull off your beards)
renowned for gravity and wisdom;--monopolus, my politician--didius, my
counsel; kysarcius, my friend;--phutatorius, my guide;--gastripheres,
the preserver of my life; somnolentius, the balm and repose of it--not
forgetting all others, as well sleeping as waking, ecclesiastical as
civil, whom for brevity, but out of no resentment to you, i lump all
together.--believe me, right worthy,

my most zealous wish and fervent prayer in your behalf, and in my own
too, in case the thing is not done already for us--is, that the great

what a shuttlecock of a fellow would the greatest philosopher that ever
existed be whisk'd into at once, did he read such books, and observe
such facts, and think such thoughts, as would eternally be making him
change sides!

now, my father, as i told you last year, detested all this--he pick'd
up an opinion, sir, as a man in a state of nature picks up an apple.--it
becomes his own--and if he is a man of spirit, he would lose his life
rather than give it up.

i am aware that didius, the great civilian, will contest this point;
and cry out against me, whence comes this man's right to this apple? ex
confesso, he will say--things were in a state of nature--the apple, is
as much frank's apple as john's. pray, mr. shandy, what patent has he
to shew for it? and how did it begin to be his? was it, when he set his
heart upon it? or when he gathered it? or when he chew'd it? or when he
roasted it? or when he peel'd, or when he brought it home? or when he
digested?--or when he--?--

for 'tis plain, sir, if the first picking up
of the apple, made it not his--that no subsequent act could.

brother didius, tribonius will answer--(now tribonius the civilian and
church lawyer's beard being three inches and a half and three eighths
longer than didius his beard--i'm glad he takes up the cudgels for me,
so i give myself no farther trouble about the answer.)--brother didius,
tribonius will say, it is a decreed case, as you may find it in the
fragments of gregorius and hermogines's codes, and in all the codes from
justinian's down to the codes of louis and des eaux--that the sweat of a
man's brows, and the exsudations of a man's brains, are as much a man's
own property as the breeches upon his backside;--which said exsudations,
&c. being dropp'd upon the said apple by the labour of finding it,
and picking it up; and being moreover indissolubly wasted, and as

 all evils, holding suspence to be the most tormenting,
we shall at least know the worst of this matter. i hate these great
dinners--said my father--the size of the dinner is not the point,
answered yorick--we want, mr. shandy, to dive into the bottom of this
doubt, whether the name can be changed or not--and as the beards of so
many commissaries, officials, advocates, proctors, registers, and of the
most eminent of our school-divines, and others, are all to meet in the
middle of one table, and didius has so pressingly invited you--who
in your distress would miss such an occasion? all that is requisite,
continued yorick, is to apprize didius, and let him manage a
conversation after dinner so as to introduce the subject.--then my
brother toby, cried my father, clapping his two hands together, shall go
with us.

--see if he is not cutting it into slips, and giving them about him to
light their pipes!--'tis abominable, answered didius; it should not
go unnoticed, said doctor kysarcius--he was of the kysarcii of the low
countries.

methinks, said didius, half rising from his chair, in order to remove a
bottle and a tall decanter, which stood in a direct line betwixt him and
yorick--you might have spared this sarcastic stroke, and have hit upon
a more proper place, mr. yorick--or at least upon a more proper occasion
to have shewn your contempt of what we have been about: if the sermon is

--i have got him fast hung up, quoth didius to himself, upon one of the
two horns of my dilemma--let him get off as he can.

i have undergone such unspeakable torments, in bringing forth this
sermon, quoth yorick, upon this occasion--that i declare, didius, i
would suffer martyrdom--and if it was possible my horse with me, a
thousand times over, before i would sit down and make such another: i
was delivered of it at the wrong end of me--it came from my head instead
of my heart--and it is for the pain it gave me, both in the writing and
preaching of it, that i revenge myself of it, in this manner--to preach,

concord was good in itself--but then 'twas quite out of the key, and
no way applicable to the subject started;--so that with all their
knowledge, they could not tell what in the world to make of it.

others who knew nothing of musical expression, and merely lent their
ears to the plain import of the word, imagined that phutatorius, who was
somewhat of a cholerick spirit, was just going to snatch the cudgels out
of didius's hands, in order to bemaul yorick to some purpose--and that
the desperate monosyllable z...ds was the exordium to an oration, which,
as they judged from the sample, presaged but a rough kind of handling of
him; so that my uncle toby's good-nature felt a pang for what yorick was
about to undergo. but seeing phutatorius stop short, without any attempt
or desire to go on--a third party began to suppose, that it was no more
than an involuntary respiration, casually forming itself into the shape

strange a theory of preaching had excited.

how finely we argue upon mistaken facts!

there was not a soul busied in all these various reasonings upon the
monosyllable which phutatorius uttered--who did not take this for
granted, proceeding upon it as from an axiom, namely, that phutatorius's
mind was intent upon the subject of debate which was arising between
didius and yorick; and indeed as he looked first towards the one and
then towards the other, with the air of a man listening to what was
going forwards--who would not have thought the same? but the truth
was, that phutatorius knew not one word or one syllable of what was
passing--but his whole thoughts and attention were taken up with a
transaction which was going forwards at that very instant within the
precincts of his own galligaskins, and in a part of them, where of

 brain--but the true
cause of his exclamation lay at least a yard below.

this i will endeavour to explain to you with all imaginable decency.

you must be informed then, that gastripheres, who had taken a turn into
the kitchen a little before dinner, to see how things went on--observing
a wicker-basket of fine chesnuts standing upon the dresser, had ordered
that a hundred or two of them might be roasted and sent in, as soon
as dinner was over--gastripheres inforcing his orders about them, that
didius, but phutatorius especially, were particularly fond of 'em.

about two minutes before the time that my uncle toby interrupted
yorick's harangue--gastripheres's chesnuts were brought in--and as
phutatorius's fondness for 'em was uppermost in the waiter's head, he
laid them directly before phutatorius, wrapt up hot in a clean damask
napkin.

thrust into the napkin at a time--but that some one chesnut, of more

which.--provided, quoth yorick, there is no bawdry in it.--

they are just now, replied phutatorius, printing off the ninth
chapter--which is the last chapter but one in the book.--pray what
is the title of that chapter? said yorick; making a respectful bow to
phutatorius as he spoke.--i think, answered phutatorius, 'tis that de re
concubinaria.

for heaven's sake keep out of that chapter, quoth yorick.

chapter 2.lxiv.

--now, quoth didius, rising up, and laying his right hand with
his fingers spread upon his breast--had such a blunder about a
christian-name happened before the reformation--(it happened the day
before yesterday, quoth my uncle toby to himself)--and when baptism
was administer'd in latin--('twas all in english, said my uncle)--many
things might have coincided with it, and upon the authority of sundry
decreed cases, to have pronounced the baptism null, with a power of
giving the child a new name--had a priest, for

ck.--ergo, such a baptism is null, said
kysarcius.--

in course, answered yorick, in a tone two parts jest and one part
earnest.--but in the case cited, continued kysarcius, where patriae is
put for patris, filia for filii, and so on--as it is a fault only in
the declension, and the roots of the words continue untouch'd, the
inflections of their branches either this way or that, does not in any
sort hinder the baptism, inasmuch as the same sense continues in the
words as before.--but then, said didius, the intention of the priest's
pronouncing them grammatically must have been proved to have gone along
with it.--right, answered kysarcius; and of this, brother didius, we
have an instance in a decree of the decretals of pope leo the iiid.--but
my brother's child, cried my uncle toby, has nothing to do with the
pope--'tis the plain child of a protestant gentleman, christen'd
tristram against the wills and wishes both of his father and mother, and
all who are a-kin to it.--

'that the mother is not of kin to her child.' (vide brook abridg. tit.
administr. n. 47.) my father instantly clapp'd his hand upon my uncle
toby's mouth, under colour of whispering in his ear;--the truth was, he
was alarmed for lillabullero--and having a great desire to hear more of
so curious an argument--he begg'd my uncle toby, for heaven's sake, not
to disappoint him in it.--my uncle toby gave a nod--resumed his pipe,
and contenting himself with whistling lillabullero inwardly--kysarcius,
didius, and triptolemus went on with the discourse as follows:

this determination, continued kysarcius, how contrary soever it may seem
to run to the stream of vulgar ideas, yet had reason strongly on its
side; and has been put out of all manner of dispute from the famous
case, known commonly by the name of the duke of suffolk's case.--it
is cited in brook, said triptolemus--and taken notice of by lord coke,
added didius.--and you may find it in swinburn on testaments, said
kysarcius.

iple in the law, said triptolemus, that things do
not ascend, but descend in it; and i make no doubt 'tis for this cause,
that however true it is, that the child may be of the blood and seed of
its parents--that the parents, nevertheless, are not of the blood and
seed of it; inasmuch as the parents are not begot by the child, but the
child by the parents--for so they write, liberi sunt de sanguine patris
& matris, sed pater & mater non sunt de sanguine liberorum.

--but this, triptolemus, cried didius, proves too much--for from this
authority cited it would follow, not only what indeed is granted on
all sides, that the mother is not of kin to her child--but the father
likewise.--it is held, said triptolemus, the better opinion; because the
father, the mother, and the child, though they be three persons, yet
are they but (una caro (vide brook abridg. tit. administr. n.47.)) one
flesh; and consequently no degree of kindred--or any method of acquiring
one in nature.--there you push the argument

which case, supposing the issue a daughter, she would stand in relation
both of--but who ever thought, cried kysarcius, of laying with his
grandmother?--the young gentleman, replied yorick, whom selden speaks
of--who not only thought of it, but justified his intention to his
father by the argument drawn from the law of retaliation.--'you
