after  five  minutes,  lieutenant  jimmy  cross  moved  to  the  tunnel,
leaned down, and examined the darkness. trouble, he thought—a cave-in
maybe.  and  then  suddenly,  without  willing  it,  he  was  thinking  about
martha. the stresses and fractures, the quick collapse, the two of them
buried  alive  under  all  that  weight.  dense,  crushing  love.  kneeling,
watching the hole, he tried to concentrate on lee strunk and the war, all
the  dangers,  but  his  love  was  too  much  for  him,  he  felt  paralyzed,  he
wanted  to  sleep  inside  her  lungs  and  breathe  her  blood  and  be
smothered. he wanted her to be a virgin and not a virgin, all at once. he
wanted  to  know  her.  intimate  secrets:  why  poetry?  why  so  sad?  why
that grayness in her eyes? why so alone? not lonely, just alone—riding
her  bike  across  campus  or  sitting  off  by  herself  in  the  cafeteria—even
dancing, she dance

enemies


one morning in late july, while we were out on patrol near lz gator,
lee strunk and dave jensen got into a fistfight. it was about something
stupid—a  missing  jackknife—but  even  so  the  fight  was  vicious.  for  a
while  it  went  back  and  forth,  but  dave  jensen  was  much  bigger  and
much stronger, and eventually he wrapped an arm around strunk's neck
and pinned him down and kept hitting him on the nose. he hit him hard.
and  he  didn't  stop.  strunk's  nose  made  a  sharp  snapping  sound,  like  a
firecracker, but even then jensen kept hitting him, over

  everywhere.  no  front  or  rear.  at  night  he  had  trouble
sleeping—a  skittish  feeling—always  on  guard,  hearing  strange  noises  in
the  dark,  imagining  a  grenade  rolling  into  his  foxhole  or  the  tickle  of  a
knife  against  his  ear.  the  distinction  between  good  guys  and  bad  guys
disappeared for him. even in times of relative safety, while the rest of us
took it easy, jensen would be sitting with his back against a stone wall,
weapon across his knees, watching lee strunk with quick, nervous eyes.
it  got  to  the  point  finally  where  he  lost  control.  something  must've
snapped. one afternoon he began firing his weapon into the air, yelling
strunk's name, just firing and yelling, and it didn't stop until he'd rattled
off  an  entire  magazine  of  ammunition.  we  were  all  flat  on  the  ground.
nobody had the nerve to go near him. jensen started to reload, but then
suddenly he sat down and held his head in his arms and wouldn't move.

e part.
because  late  that  same  night  he  borrowed  a  pistol,  gripped  it  by  the

barrel, and used it like a hammer to break his own nose.

afterward,  he  crossed  the  perimeter  to  lee  strunk's  foxhole.  he
showed him what he'd done and asked if everything was square between
them.

strunk nodded and said, sure, things were square.
but  in  the  morning  lee  strunk  couldn't  stop  laughing.  "the  man's

crazy," he said. "i stole his fucking jackknife."

friends


dave jensen and lee strunk did not become instant buddies, but they
did learn to trust each other. over the next month they often teamed up
on ambushes. they covered each other on patrol, shared a foxhole, took
turns pulling guard at night. in late august they made a pact that if one
of  them  should  ever  get  totally  rucked  up—a  wheelchair  wound—the
other guy would automatically find a way to end it. as far as i could tell

 and administered
morphine and ran plasma into him.

there was nothing much anybody could do except wait for the dustoff.
after we'd secured an lz, dave jensen went over and kneeled at strunk's
side. the stump had stopped twitching now. for a time there was some
question as to whether strunk was still alive, but then he opened his eyes
and  looked  up  at  dave  jensen.  "oh,  jesus,"  he  said,  and  moaned,  and
tried to slide away and said, "jesus, man, don't kill me."

"relax," jensen said.
lee strunk seemed groggy and confused. he lay still for a second and
then motioned toward his leg. "really, it's not so bad, not terrible. hey,
really—they can sew it back on—really."

"right, i'll bet they can."
"you think?"
"sure i do."
strunk  frowned  at  the  sky.  he  passed  out  again,  then  woke  up  and

said, "don't kill me."

"i won't," jensen said.
"i'm serious."
"sure."
"but you got to promise. swear it to me—swear you won't kill me."
jensen  nodded  and  said,  "i  swear,"  and  then

easier.

i could actually see it.
i was down there with him, inside him. i was part of the night. i was
the  land  itself—everything,  everywhere—the  fireflies  and  paddies,  the
moon, the midnight rustlings, the cool phosphorescent shimmer of evil—
i was atrocity—i was jungle fire, jungle drums—i was the blind stare in
the eyes of all those poor, dead, dumbfuck ex-pals of mine—all the pale
young corpses, lee strunk and kiowa and curt lemon—i was the beast
on their lips—i was nam—the horror, the war.


"creepy," azar said. "wet pants an' goose bumps." he held a beer out

to me, but i shook my head.

we  sat  in  the  dim  light  of  my  hootch,  boots  off,  listening  to  mary

hopkin on my tape deck.

"what next?"
"wait," i said.
"sure, but i mean—"
"shut up and listen."
that  high  elegant  voice.  someday,  when  the  war  was  over,  i'd  go  to
london  and  ask  mary  hopkin  to  marry  me.
