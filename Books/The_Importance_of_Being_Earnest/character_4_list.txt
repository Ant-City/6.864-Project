Lady Bracknell - 
                Algernon's
snobbish, mercenary, and domineering aunt and Gwendolen's mother.
Lady Bracknell married well, and her primary goal in life is to
see her daughter do the same. She has a list of "eligible young
men" and a prepared interview she gives to potential suitors. Like her
nephew, Lady Bracknell is given to making hilarious pronouncements,
but where Algernon means to be witty, the humor in Lady Bracknell's
speeches is unintentional. Through the figure of Lady Bracknell, Wilde
manages to satirize the hypocrisy and stupidity of the British aristocracy.
Lady Bracknell values ignorance, which she sees as "a delicate exotic
fruit." When she gives a dinner party, she prefers her husband to
eat downstairs with the servants. She is cunning, narrow-minded,
authoritarian, and possibly the most quotable character in the play.
