[CHARACTER]	 - 
                the
protagonist. [CHARACTER] is a brilliant sixteenth-century scholar from
wittenberg, germany, whose ambition for knowledge, wealth, and worldly
might makes him willing to pay the ultimate price--his soul--to lucifer
in exchange for supernatural powers. [CHARACTER]'s initial tragic grandeur
is diminished by the fact that he never seems completely sure of
the decision to forfeit his soul and constantly wavers about whether or
not to repent. his ambition is admirable and initially awesome,
yet he ultimately lacks a certain inner strength. he is unable to
embrace his dark path wholeheartedly but is also unwilling to admit
his mistake.
