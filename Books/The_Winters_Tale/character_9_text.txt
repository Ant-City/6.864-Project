                        let's have that, good sir.
come on, sit down;--come on, and do your best
to fright me with your sprites: you're powerful at it.

first lord.
behind the tuft of pines i met them; never
saw i men scour so on their way: i ey'd them
even to their ships.

leontes.
                     how bles'd am i
in my just censure, in my true opinion!--
alack, for lesser knowledge!--how accurs'd
in being so blest!--there may be in the cup
a spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
and yet partake no venom; for his knowledge
is not infected;

is for my better grace.--adieu, my lord:
i never wish'd to see you sorry; now
i trust i shall.--my women, come; you have leave.

yourself, your queen, your son.

first lord.
                                for her, my lord,--
i dare my life lay down,--and will do't, sir,
please you to accept it,--that the queen is spotless
i' the eyes of heaven and to you; i mean
in this which you accuse her.

antigonus.

she's otherwise, i'll keep my stables where

                  good my lord,--

it is for you we speak, not for ourselves:
you are abus'd, and by some putter-on
that will be damn'd for't: would i knew the villain,
i would land-damn him. be she honour-flaw'd,--
i have three daughters; the eldest is eleven;
the second and the third, nine and some five;
if this prove true, they'll pay for't. by mine honour,
i'll geld 'em all: fourteen they shall not see,
to bring false generations: they are co-heirs;

that presses him from sleep.

most true, if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance. that
which you hear you'll swear you see, there is such unity in the
proofs. the mantle of queen hermione; her jewel about the neck of
it; the letters of antigonus, found with it, which they know to
be his character; the majesty of the creature in resemblance of
the mother; the affection of nobleness, which nature shows above
her breeding; and many other evidences,--proclaim her with all
certainty to be the king's daughter. did you see the meeting of
the two kings?
