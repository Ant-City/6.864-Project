 by five islanders, dressed in shirt tunics of calico. my
first impression was that they were in the very act of pulling out from
the bay; and that, after all my exertions, i had come too late. my soul
sunk within me: but a second glance convinced me that the boat was only
hanging off to keep out of the surf; and the next moment i heard my own
name shouted out by a voice from the midst of the crowd.

looking in the direction of the sound, i perceived, to my indescribable
joy, the tall figure of karakoee, an oahu kanaka, who had often been
aboard the ‘dolly’, while she lay in nukuheva. he wore the green
shooting-jacket with gilt buttons, which had been given to him by an
officer of the reine blanche--the french flag-ship--and in which i had
always seen him dressed. i now remembered the kanaka had frequently told
me that his person was tabooed in all the valleys of the island, and the
sight of him at such a moment as this filled my heart with a tumult of
delight.

karakoee stood near the edg

idea, i called upon him loudly to come to me; but he replied, in broken
english, that the islanders had threatened to pierce him with their
spears, if he stirred a foot towards me. at this time i was still
advancing, surrounded by a dense throng of the natives, several of whom
had their hands upon me, and more than one javelin was threateningly
pointed at me. still i perceived clearly that many of those least
friendly towards me looked irresolute and anxious. i was still some
thirty yards from karakoee when my farther progress was prevented by the
natives, who compelled me to sit down upon the ground, while they still
retained their hold upon my arms. the din and tumult now became tenfold,
and i perceived that several of the priests were on the spot, all of
whom were evidently urging mow-mow and the other chiefs to prevent my
departure; and the detestable word ‘roo-ne! roo-ne!’ which i had heard
repeated a thousand times during the day, was now shouted out on every
side of me. still i saw

ho seemed bent upon driving him into
the sea.

when i remembered the extravagant value placed by these people upon the
articles which were offered to them in exchange for me, and which
were so indignantly rejected, i saw a new proof of the same fixed
determination of purpose they had all along manifested with regard
to me, and in despair, and reckless of consequences, i exerted all my
strength, and shaking myself free from the grasp of those who held me, i
sprang upon my feet and rushed towards karakoee.

the rash attempt nearly decided my fate; for, fearful that i might slip
from them, several of the islanders now raised a simultaneous shout,
and pressing upon karakoee, they menaced him with furious gestures, and
actually forced him into the sea. appalled at their violence, the poor
fellow, standing nearly to the waist in the surf, endeavoured to pacify
them; but at length fearful that they would do him some fatal violence,
he beckoned to his comrades to pull in at once, and take him into the

now or never was the moment. clasping my hands together, i
looked imploringly at marheyo, and move towards the now almost deserted
beach. the tears were in the old man’s eyes, but neither he nor
kory-kory attempted to hold me, and i soon reached the kanaka, who had
anxiously watched my movements; the rowers pulled in as near as they
dared to the edge of the surf; i gave one parting embrace to fayaway,
who seemed speechless with sorrow, and the next instant i found myself
safe in the boat, and karakoee by my side, who told the rowers at once
to give way. marheyo and kory-kory, and a great many of the women,
followed me into the water, and i was determined, as the only mark of
gratitude i could show, to give them the articles which had been brought
as my ransom. i handed the musket to kory-kory, with a rapid gesture
which was equivalent to a ‘deed of gift’; threw the roll of cotton to
old marheyo, pointing as i did so to poor fayaway, who had retired from
the edge of the water and was sitt

 suspended the conflict in which they
were engaged, and it was not until the boat was above fifty yards from
the shore that mow-mow and some six or seven other warriors rushed into
the sea and hurled their javelins at us. some of the weapons passed
quite as close to us as was desirable, but no one was wounded, and the
men pulled away gallantly. but although soon out of the reach of the
spears, our progress was extremely slow; it blew strong upon the shore,
and the tide was against us; and i saw karakoee, who was steering the
boat, give many a look towards a jutting point of the bay round which we
had to pass.

for a minute or two after our departure, the savages, who had formed
into different groups, remained perfectly motionless and silent. all
at-once the enraged chief showed by his gestures that he had resolved
what course he would take. shouting loudly to his companions, and
pointing with his tomahawk towards the headland, he set off at full
speed in that direction, and was followed by abo

ownwards. i had no time to repeat the blow, but i saw him rise
to the surface in the wake of the boat, and never shall i forget the
ferocious expression of his countenance.

only one other of the savages reached the boat. he seized the gunwhale,
but the knives of our rowers so mauled his wrists, that he was forced to
quit his hold, and the next minute we were past them all, and in safety.
the strong excitement which had thus far kept me up, now left me, and i
fell back fainting into the arms of karakoee.

           . . . . . . . .

the circumstances connected with my most unexpected escape may be very
briefly stated. the captain of an australian vessel, being in distress
for men in these remote seas, had put into nukuheva in order to recruit
his ship’s company; but not a single man was to be obtained; and the
barque was about to get under weigh, when she was boarded by karakoee,
who informed the disappointed englishman that an american sailor
was detained by the savages in the neighbouring

bay of typee; and he
offered, if supplied with suitable articles of traffic, to undertake his
release. the kanaka had gained his intelligence from marnoo, to whom,
after all, i was indebted for my escape. the proposition was acceded to;
and karakoee, taking with him five tabooed natives of nukuheva, again
repaired aboard the barque, which in a few hours sailed to that part of
the island, and threw her main-top-sail aback right off the entrance
to the typee bay. the whale-boat, manned by the tabooed crew, pulled
towards the head of the inlet, while the ship lay ‘off and on’ awaiting
its return.

the events which ensued have already been detailed, and little more
remains to be related. on reaching the ‘julia’ i was lifted over the
