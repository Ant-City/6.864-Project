look  of  their  hair.  my  hair  was  constantly  going  off  in 
eleven  wrong  directions,  and  t.  ray,  naturally,  refused 
to buy me bristle rollers, so all year i'd had to roll it on 
welch's  grape  juice  cans,  which  had  nearly  turned  me 
into  an  insomniac.  i  was  always  having  to  choose  
between decent hair and a good night's sleep. 

i  decided  i  would  take  four  or  five  centuries  to  
tell her about the special misery of living with t. ray. he 
had  an  orneriness  year-round,  but  especially  in  the 
summer, when he worked his peach orchards daylight to 
dusk. mostly  i stayed out of his way. his  only kindness 
was for snout, his bird dog, who slept in his bed and got 
her stomach scratched anytime she rolled onto her wiry 
back. i've seen snout pee on t. ray's boot and it not get 
a rise out of him. 

i  had  asked  god  repeatedly  to  do  something 
about  t.  ray.  he'd  gone  to  church  for  forty  years  and

i  dug  my  nails  into  my  palms  till  my  skin  had  
nearly turned to herringbone. a person could get stung 
half to death in a roomful of bees.

the only person around was t. ray. and if he happened 
to  get  stung  by  a  couple  of  hundred  bees,  well,  i  was 
sorry. 

i  slid  from  the  covers  and  dashed  through  the 
bees for the door. i woke him by touching his arm with

jar of these bees, presenting them to t. ray, and saying,

my first and only memory of my mother was the 
day  she  died.  i  tried  for  a  long  time  to  conjure  up  an  
image of her before that, just a sliver of something, like 
her  tucking  me  into  bed,  reading  the  adventures  of 
uncle  wiggly,  or  hanging  my  underclothes  near  the 
space  heater  on  ice-cold  mornings.  even  her  picking  a 
switch off the forsythia bush and stinging my legs would 
have been welcome.

and clapped them together. 

the  closet  floor  vibrated  whenever  someone 
climbed the stairs below it, which is how i knew t. ray 
was  coming.  over  my head  i heard  my  mother,  pulling 
things  from  the  hangers,  the  swish  of  clothes,  wire 
clinking  together.  hurry,  she  said.  when  his  shoes 
clomped  into  the  room,  she  sighed,  the  breath  leaving 
her as if her lungs had suddenly clenched. 

this  is  the  last  thing  i  remember  with  perfect 
crispness—her  breath  floating  down  to  me  like  a  tiny 
parachute, collapsing without a trace among the piles of 
shoes.

sign with owens peach enterprises painted across it 
in the worst orange color you've ever seen. i hated that 
sign. but the sign was nothing compared with the giant 
peach  perched  atop  a  sixty-foot  pole  beside  the  gate. 
everyone at school referred to it as the great fanny, and 
i'm  cleaning  up  the  language.  its  fleshy  color,  not  to 
mention  the  crease  down  the  middle,  gave  it  the 
unmistakable appearance of a rear end. rosaleen said it

t. ray. 

he didn't believe in slumber parties or sock hops, 
which wasn't a big concern as i never got invited to them 
anyway, but he refused to drive me to town for football 
games, pep rallies, or beta club car washes, which were 
held on saturdays. he did not care that i wore clothes i 
made for myself in home economics class, cotton print

sometimes i purely hated her. 
the morning after i woke t. ray, rosaleen stood 
in the doorway of my room, watching me chase a bee 
with a mason jar. her lip was rolled out so far i could see 
the little sunrise of pink inside hermouth. 

"what are you doing with that jar?" she said.

the  chick  for  dinner  and  fire  rosaleen  for  being  an  
imbecile.  he  started  to  swoop  at  the  biddy  with  his  
tractor  grease  hands,  but  rosaleen  planted  herself  in

she'd thrown her husband out three years after 
they married, for carousing. "you put his brain in a bird, 
the  bird  would  fly  backward,"  she  liked  to  say.  i  often 
wondered  what  that  bird  would  do  with  rosaleen's 
brain. i decided half the time it would drop shit on your 
head and the other half it would sit on abandoned nests 
with its wings spread wide. 

i used to have daydreams in which she was white 
and married t. ray, and became my real mother. other 
times i was a negro orphan she found in a cornfield and 
adopted.  once  in  a  while  i  had  us  living  in  a  foreign 
country  like  new  york, where  she  could  adopt  me and 
we could both stay our natural color.

my mother's name was deborah. i thought that 
was  the  prettiest  name  i'd  ever  heard,  even  though  t. 
ray refused to speak it. if i said it, he acted like he might 
go  straight  to  the  kitchen  and  stab  something.

nce when he stepped on a roach in the 
kitchen,  he told  me  my  mother  had  spent  hours  luring 
roaches out of the house with bits of marshmallow and 
trails of graham-cracker crumbs, that she was a lunatic 
when it came to saving bugs. 

the  oddest  things  caused  me  to  miss  her.  like  
training  bras.  who  was  i  going  to  ask  about  that?  and 
who but my mother could're understood the magnitude 
of  driving  me  to  junior  cheerleader  tryouts?  i  can  tell 
you for certain t. ray didn't grasp it. but you know when 
i missed her the most? the day i was twelve and woke 
up  with  the  rose-petal  stain  on  my  panties.  i  was  so  
proud of that flower and didn't have a soul to show it to 
except rosaleen. 

not  long  after  that  i  found  a  paper  bag  in  the 
attic stapled at the top. inside it i found the last traces of 
my mother. 

there was a photograph of a woman smirking in 
front  of  an  old  car,  wearing  a  light-colored  dress  with

memory  of  that  afternoon  when  the  gun went  off,  but 
later i would slip out there, sometimes after t. ray had 
gone to bed, just to lie under the trees and be peaceful.

after my morning of capturing bees, i spent the 
afternoon in the peach stand out on the highway, selling 
t. ray's peaches. it was the loneliest summer job a girl 
could have, stuck in a roadside hut with three walls and 
a flat tin roof. 

i sat on a coke crate and watched pickups zoom 
by  till  i  was  nearly  poisoned  with  exhaust  fumes  and 
boredom. thursday afternoons were usually a big peach 
day, with women getting ready for sunday cobblers, but 
not a soul stopped. t. ray refused to let me bring books 
out here and read, and if i smuggled one out, say, lost

she  said  a  scholarship  was  my  only  hope  for  a

whenever i opened one, t. ray said, "who do you think 
you are, julius shakespeare?" the man sincerely thought 
that  was  shakespeare's  first  name,  and  if  you  think  i 
should have corrected  him, you are ignorant about  the 
art  of  survival.  he  also  referred  to  me  as  miss  brown-

found me in the peach stand sticking a nail into one of 
his  peaches.  he  walked  toward  me  with  his  thumbs 
jammed into his pockets and his eyes squinted half shut 
from the glare. i watched his shadow slide over the dirt 
and weeds and thought he had  come to punish me for 
stabbing a peach. i didn't even know why i was doing it.

overwhelm me, and i would take off running—even if it 
was  raining  out,  i  ran—straight  down  the  hill  to  my  
special place in the peach orchard. i'd lie right down on 
the ground and it would calm me. 

now, t. ray scooped up a handful of dirt and let 
if  fall  out  of  his  hands.  "the  day  she  died,  she  was 
cleaning out the closet," he said. i could not account for 
the strange tone of his voice, an unnatural sound, how it 
was almost, but not quite, kind. 

cleaning the closet. i had never considered what 
she  was  doing  those  last  minutes  of  her  life,  why  she 
was in the closet, what they had fought about.

got my hopes up thinking this year would be the one. 

i  had  the  same  birthday  as  the  country,  which 
made it even harder to get noticed. when i was little, i

chest and the sky puckering with light. 

i  woke  to  the  sound  of  someone  thrashing 
through the trees. t. ray! i sat up, panicked, buttoning 
my shirt. i heard his footsteps, the fast, heavy pant of his 
breathing. looking down, i saw my mother's gloves and 
the two pictures. i stopped buttoning and grabbed them 
up, fumbling with them, unable to think what to do, how 
to hide them. i had dropped the tin box back in its hole, 
too far away to reach.

plunge toward me across the ground.

arms,  startled  by  what  he  was  thinking.  i  couldn't  look  
long  at  his  face,  how  large  and  blazing  it  was,  like  the  
face of god. 

he  flung  the  beam  of  light  into  the  darkness. 

"who's out there?" he yelled. 

"please, t. ray, no one was here but me." 
"get up from there," he yelled. 
i followed him back to the house. his feet struck 
the  ground  so  hard  i  felt  sorry  for  the  black  earth.  he  
didn't  speak  till  we  reached  the  kitchen  and  he  pulled 
the martha white grits from the pantry. 

"i expect this out of boys, lily—you can't blame 
them—but i expect more out of you. you act no better 
than a slut." 

he poured a mound of grits the size of an anthill

to  the  floor,  determined  not  to  cry,  but  the  sting  was  
already gathering in my eyes. 

t. ray sat in a chair and cleaned his nails with a 
pocketknife.  i  swayed  from  knee  to  knee,  hoping  for  a 
second or two of relief, but the pain cut deep into my

door. 

"well,  look  who  decided to  get  up."  he  yanked 
the bread out of my hands and threw it into snout's food 
bowl. 

"would it be too much to ask you to get out to 
the peach stand and do some work? you're not queen 
for a day, you know." 

this will sound crazy, but up until then i thought 
t. ray probably loved me some. i could never forget the 
time he smiled at me in church when i was singing with 
the hymnbook upside down. 

now i looked at his face. it was despising and full 

of anger.

the finish was rubbed off the sides of the picture 
where her thumbs had held it. her shelf had to do with a 
religion she'd made  up for herself, a  mixture of  nature 
and ancestor worship. she'd stopped going to the house 
of prayer full gospel holiness church years ago because 
it started at ten in the morning and didn't end till three 
in the afternoon, which is enough religion to kill a full-
grown person, she'd said. 

t. ray said rosaleen's religion was plain wacko,

think  she  loved  water  rocks  and  woodpecker  feathers, 
that she had a single picture of her mother just like i did. 
one  of  the  church  doors  opened  and  brother 

gerald, our minister, stepped into the sanctuary. 

"well,  for  goodness"  sake,  lily,  what  are  you 

doing here?"

somebody had scratched the words "shit throne" across 
a  bench  attached  to  one  wall.  nothing  seemed  quite 
real. we're in jail, i thought. we're in jail.

when rosaleen pulled back the towel, i saw an 
inch-long  gash  across  a  puffy  place  high  over  her 
eyebrow. "is it hurting bad?" i asked. 

"some,"  she  said.  she  circled  the  cell  two  or  

three times before sinking down onto the bench. 

"t. ray will get us out," i said. 
"uh-huh." 
she  didn't  speak  another  word  till  mr.  gaston 
opened the cell door about a half hour later. "come on," 
he  said.  rosaleen  looked  hopeful  for  a  moment.  she 
actually  started  to  lift  herself  up.  he  shook  his  head. 
"you ain't going anywhere. just the girl." 

at the door i held on to a cell bar like it was the 
long bone in rosaleen's arm. "i'll be back. all right?… all 
right, rosaleen?" 

"you go on, i'll manage."

"what  i  mean  is,  i  wouldn't  be  surprised  if  he 

flat-out killed her." 

my arms felt weak in their sockets. 
franklin  posey was  the man  with  the flashlight, 
and  he  was  gonna  kill  rosaleen.  but  then,  hadn't  i 
known this inside even before t. ray ever said it?

he  followed  me  up  the  stairs.  i  moved  with  
deliberate slowness, anger suddenly building in me. how 
could he leave rosaleen in jail like that? 

as i stepped inside  my room, he stopped at the 
doorway. "i have to go settle the payroll for the pickers," 
he said. "don't you leave this room. you understand me? 
you  sit  here  and  think  about  me  coming  back  and 
dealing with you. think about it real hard."

toothbrush,  rubber  bands  for  my  hair,  all  the  time 
watching the window. what else? catching sight of the 
map  tacked  on  the  wall,  i  snatched  it  down,  not 
bothering to pry out the tacks. 

i reached under the mattress and pulled out my 
mother's picture, the gloves, and the wooden picture of 
black mary, and tucked them down in the bag, too. 

tearing a sheet of paper from last year's english 
notebook, i wrote a note, short and to the point: "dear 
t. ray, don't bother looking for me. lily. p.s. people who 
tell lies like you should rot in hell." 

when i checked the window, t. ray was coming 
out of the orchard toward the house, fists balled, head 
plowed forward like a bull wanting to gore something. 

i  propped  the  note  on  my  dresser  and  stood  a 
moment in the center of the room, wondering if i'd ever 
see it again. "goodbye," i said, and there was a tiny sprig 
of sadness pushing up from my heart. 

outside, 

i  spied  the  broken

in  the

t. ray's boots stomped across the porch.

"lily!  li-leeeee!"  i  heard  his  voice  sailing  along 

the floorboards of the house. 

all of a sudden i caught sight of snout sniffing at 
the  spot  where  i'd  crawled  through.  i  backed  deeper 
into the darkness, but she'd caught my scent and started 
barking her mangy head off. 

t.  ray  emerged  with  my  note  crumpled  in  his 
hand, yelled at snout to shut the hell up, and tore out in 
his  truck,  leaving  plumes  of  exhaust  all

jasmine so thick i could almost see it circling in the air 
like golden smoke. 

she didn't ask me why we were going to tiburon, 
and  i  didn't  tell  her.  what  she  did  ask  was  "when  did 
you start saying "shit bucket"?" 

i'd  never  resorted  to  bad  language,  though  i'd 
heard my share of it from t. ray or else read it in public 
restrooms.  "i'm  fourteen  now.  i  guess  i  can  say  it  if  i  
want  to."  and 
i  wanted  to,  right  that  minute. 
"shitbucket," i said. 

"shitbucket,  hellfire,  damnation,  and  son  of  a 
mother bitch," said rosaleen, laying into each word like 
it was sweet potatoes on her tongue.

cantaloupes for our supper. 

"take yourself two," he said. 
we waited till  his  taillights turned  to  specks no 
bigger  than  lightning  bugs  before  we  spoke  or  even 
moved.  i  was  trying  not  to  think  how  sad  and  lost  we 
really  were.  i  was  not  so  sure  it  was  an  improvement 
over living with t. ray, or even life in prison. 

there  wasn't  a  soul  anywhere  to  help  us.  but 
still, i felt painfully alive, like every cell in my body had a 
little flame inside it, burning so brightly it hurt. 

"at least we got a full moon," i told rosaleen. 
we  started  walking.  if  you  think  the  country  is 
quiet, you've never lived in it. tree frogs alone make you

i had no idea rosaleen had ever seen my mother. 
i felt suddenly light-headed, not knowing if it was from 
hunger  or  tiredness  or  this  surprising  piece  of  news. 
"what  was  she  doing  that  time  you  saw  her  alone?"  i  
asked. 

"she was out behind the tractor shed, sitting on 
the ground, staring off at nothing. when we walked by, 
she  didn't  even  notice  us.  i  remember  thinking  she 
looked a little sad." 

"well, who wouldn't be sad living with t. ray?" i 

said. 

i  saw  the  lightbulb  snap  on  in  rosaleen's  face 

then, the flash of recognition. 

 

81 

"oh,"  she  said.  "i  get  it.  you  ran  off  'cause  of  
what your daddy said about your mother. it didn't have 
nothing  to  do  with  me  in  jail.  and  here  you  got  me  
worrying  myself  sick  about  you  running  away  and 
getting  in  trouble  over  me,  and  you  would've  run  off 
anyway. well, ain't it nice of you to fill me in." 

she poked out her lip and looked

said. "go from town to town asking people about your

"if i needed somebody to criticize me around the 

clock, i could've brought t. ray along!" i shouted. 

"and for your information, i don't exactly have a 

plan." 

"well,  you  sure  had  one  back  at  the  hospital, 
coming  in  there  saying  we're  gonna  do  this  and  we're 
gonna do that, and i'm supposed to follow you like a pet

nature, what she'd done with the world. in my mind she 
looked like eleanor roosevelt. 

i  thought  about  her  the  next  morning  when  i 
woke beside the creek in a bed of kudzu vines. a barge 
of  mist  floated  along  the  water,  and  dragonflies, 
iridescent  blue  ones,  darted  back  and  forth  like  they 
were stitching up the air. it was such a pretty sight for a

rosaleen slept with her mouth open and a long 
piece of drool hanging from her bottom lip. i could tell 
by  the  way  her  eyes  rolled  under  her  lids  she  was  
watching the silver screen where dreams come and go. 
her swollen face looked better, but in the bright of day i 
noticed  purple  bruises  on  her  arms  and  legs  as  well.

i'm  sure  it  hadn't  been  on  looks.  the  whole  front  of  it  
was a forgotten bulletin board: studebaker service, live 
bait, buddy's fishing tournament, rayford brothers' ice

same way. 

the lips on the statue had a beautiful, bossy half 
smile,  the  sight  of  which  caused  me  to  move  both  my  
hands up to my throat. everything about that smile said, 
lily owens, i know you down to the core. 

i  felt  she  knew  what  a  lying,  murdering,  hating 
person i really was. how i hated t. ray, and the girls at 
school, but mostly myself for taking away my mother. 

i  wanted  to  cry,  but  then,  in  the  next  instant,  i  
wanted to laugh, because the statue also made me feel 
like  lily  the smiled-upon, like there  was goodness  and 
beauty in me, too. like i really had all that fine potential

when  i  put  on  my  shoes  and  headed  back,  the

the next overrun with everybody's misery. the last thing 
i wanted was to be like that, but i didn't want to be like

silence. 

"rosaleen, don't act like that. august might know 

things about my mother." 

she  raised  up  on  her  elbow  and  looked  at  me. 
"lily, your mama's gone," she said softly. "and she ain't 
coming back." 

i  sat  straight  up.  "how  do  you  know  she  isn't 
alive right in this very town? t. ray could've lied about 
her being dead, just like he lied about her leaving me."

it."

instead. 

"you think t. ray was telling me the truth about 

her leaving me, don't you?" 

"i don't have any idea about that," rosaleen said. 

"i just don't want you getting yourself hurt." 

i lay back on the bed. in the silence  my hiccups 

ricocheted around the room.

came for us. but where to start? i couldn't just pull out 
the  black  mary  picture  and  show  it  to  august  without 
the truth wrecking everything, and she would decide—
might decide, would decide, i couldn't say—that she was 
obliged to call t. ray to come get me. and if she knew 
that rosaleen was a true fugitive, wouldn't she have to 
call the police?

had been  fond  of  sending  early in his  career, the  ones 
designed to make the pharaoh change his mind and let 
moses take the people out of egypt. let my people go, 
moses said. i'd seen the plague of locusts at the movies, 
the sky filled with hordes of insects looking like kamikaze

were sent as a special plague for t. ray. god saying, let 
my daughter  go,  and  maybe that's  exactly  what  they'd 
been, a plague that released me.

all  sides  and  the  motherless  place  throbbing  away,  i

anything  i  wanted,  except my mother,  so  naturally  she 
was the only thing that wanted on the elevator. 

i could feel things unraveling around me. all the 
fraying edge of the dream world. pull one wrong thread 
and i would be standing in wreckage to my elbows. ever 
since i'd called t. ray, i wanted so badly to tell rosaleen 
about it. to say, if you've been wondering whether my 
leaving  has  caused  t.  ray  to  examine  his  heart,  or 
change  his  ways,  don't  waste  your  time.  but  i  couldn't 
bring myself to admit to her that i'd cared enough to call 
him. 

what was wrong with me that i was living here 
as if i had nothing to hide? i lay on the cot and stared at 
the  glaring  square  of  window,  exhausted.  it  takes  so 
much  energy  to  keep  things  at  bay.  le

said. "it works every time." 

i don't know how long i stared at the line on the 
floor, at may's face turned toward mine, eager for me to 
say  something,  but  i  couldn't  think  what  to  say.  the 
room  filled  with  the  steady  whir  of  the  refrigerator 
motor. i felt a strange, thick feeling inside. a memory. i 
stood there waiting, letting it come … your mother was a 
lunatic when it came to bugs, t. ray had said. she used 
to  make 
trails  of  graham  cracker  crumbs  and 
marshmallows to lure roaches outside. 

i looked again at may. my mother couldn't have 
learned the roach trick from may, i thought. could she? 

ever  since  i'd  set  foot  in  the  pink  house,  some  
part of me had kept believing that my mother had been 
here. no, not believing it so much as daydreaming it and 
running  it through a maze of wishful thinking.  but now

i looked at them, tried to smile, but my mind was 

on the men, who i could see were watching us. 

the  boys  saw  it,  too,  and  one  of  them—who  i 
would later find out was named jackson—said real loud, 
"you  gotta  be  dumb  as  dirt  to  believe  jack  palance  is  
coming to tiburon," and all of them laughed. even zach. 
the man holding the shovel handle walked right 
up to the truck bumper and stared at the boys with that 
same half smile, half sneer i had seen on t. ray's face a 
thousand  times,  the  sort  of  look  conjured  from  power 
without  benefit  of  love,  and  he  yelled,  "what  did  you 
say, boy?" 

the murmuring noise on the street fell away. the 
beagle  dropped  his  ears  and  slunk  off  under  a  parked 
car. i saw jackson bite down, causing a tiny ripple across 
his jaw. i saw him raise his r.c. cola bottle over his head. 
and throw it.

i opened them again, there was glass sprayed acr

our best to keep her memory going. for some reason i

for the time being. say this to her: "lily would appreciate 
a sign letting her know that you love her. it doesn't have 
to be anything big, but please send something." 

i  let  out  a  long  breath,  still  holding  her  dead 
hand,  thinking  how  big  her  fingers  felt  in  mine.  so  i 
guess  this  is  good-bye,  i  told  her.  a  shudder  went 
through me, a burning along my eyelashes.

i opened my eyes and nodded. 
"you said your father was dead." 
i glanced down at her hand still on mine, afraid 
she  might  move  it.  "i  made  that  up,"  i  said.  "he's  not 
really dead." he just deserves to be dead. 

"terrence ray," she said. 
"you know my father, too?" 
"no, i never met him, only heard about him from 

deborah." 

"i call him t. ray." 
"not daddy?" 
"he's not the daddy type."

"t.  ray…  he  told  me  my  mother…"  the  tears

"i want you to know," i said, "i didn't believe t.

left  me  like  that.  i  wanted  to  find  out  about  her  and 
prove how wrong he was." 

i  watched  her  move  her  hand  up  under  her 
glasses  and  pinch  the  place  between  her  eyes.  "and 
that's what made you leave?" 

i  nodded.  "plus,  rosaleen  and  i  got  in  trouble 
downtown, and i knew if i didn't leave, t. ray was gonna 
half kill me, and i was tired of being half killed." 

"what sort of trouble?"

little  in  her  body.  "they  put  you  in  jail?  what  was  the

among ordinary things.isn't that what august had said?

"i  don't  mean  to  be  a  bad  person,"  i  said,  and 
stared at my hands, how they were folded together like 
hands in prayer. "i can't seem to help it." 

you would think i was totally cried out, but tears 
beaded again along my lids. "i do all the wrong things. i 
tell  lies,  all  the  time.  not  to  you.  well,  i  have—but  for  
good reasons. and i hate people. not just t. ray but lots 
of  people.  the  girls  at  school,  and  they  haven't  done

i  hate  rosaleen  because

thunder rumbled over the trees. i thought of my 
mother's tea parties, tiny sandwiches for a doll's mouth, 
and it washed me in sadness. maybe because i would've 
loved  so  much  to  have  attended  something  like  that. 
maybe  because  all  the  sandwiches  would've  been 
peanut butter, my mother's favorite, and i wasn't even 
that crazy about it. i wondered at the poem august had 
made her learn, whether it had stuck with her after she 
got married. had she lain in her bed listening to t. ray 
snore,  reciting  it  while  she  fell  asleep,  wishing  to  god 
she could run away with robert frost? 

i gave  a sideways glance at  august. i  forced my 
mind  back  to  that  moment  in  her  bedroom  when  i'd 
confessed  the worst  of  human things. upon  hearing it, 
she'd said, i love you. just like i loved your mother.

stopped talking. "the picture explains how you came to

rah was pregnant, that's why." 

the instant before she said it, i knew what was 

coming, but still her words fell like a hammer. 

"she was pregnant with me?" my voice sounded 
tired saying the words. my mother's life was too heavy 
for me. 

"that's  right,  pregnant  with  you.  she  and 
terrence  ray  got  married  around  christmastime.  she 
called long distance to  tell me." unwanted, i thought. i

gotten stuck with t. ray because of me. i was glad it was 
dark, so august couldn't see my face, how bent in it was. 
you think you want to know something, and then once 
you  do,  all  you  can  think  about  is  erasing  it  from  your  
mind.  from  now  on  when  people  asked  me  what  i 
wanted  to  be  when  i  grew  up,  i  planned  to  say, 
amnesiac. 

i  listened  to  the  hiss  of  rain.  the  spray  floated  
over  and  misted  my  cheeks  while  i  counted  on  my  
fingers.  "i  was  born  seven  months

e calls from her, spread out over the first couple of 
years, and i could see she was making an effort. mostly 
she  wrote  about  you,  how  you  were  sitting  up,  taking 
your first steps, playing patty-cake. but then her letters 
came  less  and  less  often,  and  when  they  did  come,  i  
could tell she was unhappy. one day she called me up. it 
was  the  end  of  august  or  first  of  september—i 
remember because we'd had mary day not long before 
that. 

"she said she was leaving t. ray, that she had to 
leave home. she wanted to know if she could stay with 
us here for a few  months till she figured out where to 
go. of course, i said, that would be fine. when i picked 
her  up  at  the  bus  station,  she  didn't  even  look  like 
herself.  she  had  gotten  so  thin  and  had  these  dark 
circles under her eyes." 

my stomach did a slow roll. i knew we'd come to 
the  place  in  the  story  i  feared  the  most.  i  began  to  
breathe very fast. "i was with her when you

so i didn't take her back to him again." 

"bull  street.  the  mental  institution?"  the  story 
was  getting  worse  by  the  minute.  "but  that's  for  crazy  
people," i said. 

"i guess he didn't know what else to do for her, 
but she wasn't crazy. she was depressed, but not crazy." 
"you  should've  let  him  put  her  in  there.  i  wish 

she'd rotted in there." 

"lily!" 
i'd shocked her, and i was glad. 

363 

 

my  mother  had  been  looking  for  love,  and 
instead she'd found t. ray and the farm, and then me, 
and i had not been enough for her. she'd left me with t. 
ray owens. 

the sky was split by a zigzagged path of lightning, 
but even then i didn't move. my hair blew like smoke in 
every  direction.  i  felt  my  eyes  harden,  grow  flat  and 
narrow as pennies. i stared at a dollop of bird shit on the 
bottom step, the way the rain was smearing it into the 
crevices of the wood. 

"are you listening now?" august said. her voice 
sifted  through  the  screen,  littl

at me through the window." 

i leaned my head on august's shoulder and knew 
exactly what had happened next. i closed my eyes, and 
there  it  was.  the  long-gone  day  that  would  never 
leave—the  suitcase  on  the  floor,  how  she'd  tossed 
clothes into it without folding them. 

hurry, she'd kept saying. 
t. ray had told me she came back for her things. 
but she'd come back for me, too. she'd wanted to bring 
me here, to tiburon, to august's. 

if only we'd made it. i remembered the sound of 
t. ray's boots on the stairs. i wanted to pound my fists 
against something, to scream at my mother for getting 
caught, for not packing faster, for not coming sooner. 

at last i looked up at august. when i spoke, my 
mouth  tasted  bitter.  "i  remember  it.  i  remember  her 
coming back for me." 

"i wondered

rosaleen  shifted  her  weight,  and  the  toilet  lid 
squeaked and slid around on top of the seat. she raked 
her fingers over the top of her head. i looked away, at 
the  pipe  under  the  sink,  at  a  smudge  of  rust  on  the 
linoleum. 

"so  your  mother  did  leave  after  all,"  she  said. 

"lord, i was afraid of that." 

i  lifted  my  head.  i  remembered  that  first  night 
after  we  ran  away,  down  by  the  creek,  when  i'd  told  
rosaleen what t. ray had said. i'd wanted her to laugh 
at  the  very  idea  of  my  mother  leaving  me,  but  she'd  
hesitated. 

"you knew already, didn't you?" i said. 
"i  didn't  know  for  sure,"  she  said.  "i  just  heard 

things." 

"what things?" 
she let out a sigh, really something more than a 
sigh. "after your mama died," she said, "i heard t. ray 
on the phone talking to that neighbor lady, mrs. watson. 
he was telling her he didn't need her to watch after you, 
that he'd gotten  one of the  pick

or  out  by  the  wailing  wall,  stuffing her  burdens  among 
the stones. i would've bet twenty dollars t. ray's name 
was  squashed  into  the  cracks  and  crevices  out  there. 
maybe the name lily was out there, too. i wished she'd

exactly what would happen. everything in my body felt 
it. "i suppose so," i said. i coiled the phone cord around 
my finger and stared down the hall at the front door. for

myself leaving through it and not coming back.

he had me by the arm in one swoop, lifting me 
up. once on my feet, i wrenched away and ran for the

twisting to face him, i saw he had the knife. he waved it 
in front of my face.

to me but to deborah. like his mind had snapped back 
ten years. 

"t. ray," i said. "it's me—lily." 
he didn't hear me. he had a fistful of my hair and 

wouldn't let go. "deborah," he said. 

"goddamn bitch," he said. 
he  seemed  crazy  with  anguish,  reliving  a  pain 
he'd  kept  locked  up  all  this  time,  and  now  that  it  was  
loose, it had overwhelmed him. i wondered how far he'd 
go to try and take deborah back. for all i knew, he might 
kill her.

"lily  can  have  a  home  here  for  as  long  as  she  
wants,"  august  said,  stepping  into  the  room,  rosaleen 
right beside her. i went and stood with them. outside, i 
heard  queenie's  car  pull  into  the  driveway.  it  had  a 
muffler  you  couldn't  mistake.  apparently  august  had 
called the daughters. 

"lily said you'd run off," t. ray said to rosaleen. 
"well, i guess i'm back now," she said. 
"i don't care where the hell you are or where you 

end up," he said to her. "but lily's coming with me." 

even as he said it, i could tell he didn't want me, 
didn't  want  me  back  on  the  farm,  didn't  want  to  be 
reminded of her. another part of him—the good part, if 
there was such a thing—might even be thinking that i'd 
be better off here.

like they might have to use them to beat the living hell 
out of somebody. 

i wondered how we must look to him. a bunch of 
women—mabelee four foot ten, lunelle's hair standing 
straight  up  on  her  head  begging  to  be  braided,  violet 
muttering,  "blessed  mary,"  and  queenie—tough  old 
queenie—with her hands on her hips and her lip shoved 
out, every inch of her saying, i double-dog dare you to 
take this girl. 

t. ray sniffed hard and looked at the ceiling. his 
resolve  was  crumbling  all  around  him.  you  could 
practically see bits of it flaking off. 

august  saw 

it,  too.  she  stepped  forward. 
sometimes i forgot how tall she was. "mr. owens, you 
would be doing lily and the rest of us a favor by leaving 
her  here.  i  made  her  my  apprentice  beekeeper,  and 
she's  learning  the  whole  business  and  helping  us  out 
with all her hard work. we love lily, and we'll take care 
of her, i prom

i'd be lying. it was you who did it, lily. you didn't mean 
it, but it was you." 

he  looked  at  me  a  moment  longer.  then  he  
inched backward out leaving me with the smell of truck 
oil.  the  bees  were  everywhere,  hovering  over  the 
hydrangea  and  the  myrtle  spread  across  the  lawn,  the 
jasmine at the wood's edge, the lemon balm clustered at 
the fence.  maybe  he was  telling me  the truth, but  you 
could never know a hundred percent with t. ray. 

he drove away slowly, not tearing down the road 
like  i  expected.  i  watched  till  he  was  gone  from  sight,  
then turned and looked at august and rosaleen and the 
daughters on the porch. this is the moment i remember 
clearest of all—how i stood in the driveway looking back
