Suffolk - 
      A lord of the court, Suffolk convinced the king to marry Margaret, a woman he captured in France and wooed for the king, since he was himself already married. Suffolk is infatuated with Margaret and hopes to influence Henry through her. Margaret and he plot together against each of the lords. Yet Suffolk is banished when the commoners demand he be punished for the wrongful death of Gloucester, and he is beheaded by pirates at sea.
