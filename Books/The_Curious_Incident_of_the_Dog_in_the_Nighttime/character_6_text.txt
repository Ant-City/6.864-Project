it was 7 minutes after midnight. the dog was lying on the grass in the middle of the lawn in front of mrs. 
shears's house. its eyes were closed. it looked as if it was running on its side, the way dogs run when they 
think they are chasing a cat in a dream. but the dog was not running or asleep. the dog was dead. there 
was a garden fork sticking out of the dog. the points of the fork must have gone all the way through the 
dog and i

 the door of number 38, which is the house next to our house, because the people there 
take drugs and father says that i should never talk to them, so i don't. and they play loud music at night 
and they make me scared sometimes when i see them in the street. and it is not really their house. 
 
then i noticed that the old lady who lives at number 39, which is on the other side of mrs. shears's house, 
was in her front garden cutting her hedge with an electric hedge trimmer. 
 
her name is mrs. alexander. she has a dog. it is a dachshund, so she was probably a good person because 
she liked dogs. but the dog wasn't in the garden with her. it was inside the house. 
 
mrs. alexander was wearing jeans and training shoes, which old people don't normally wear. and there 
was mud on the jeans. and the trainers were new balance trainers. and the laces were red. 
 
i went up to mrs. alexander and said, "do you know anything about wellington being killed?" 
 
then she turned the electric hedge trimmer o

re probably right." 
 
i said, "thank you for helping me with my investigation." 
 
and she said, "you're christopher, aren't you." 
 
i said, "yes. i live at number 36." 
 
and she said, "we haven't talked before, have we." 
 
i said, "no. i don't like talking to strangers. but i'm doing detective work." 
 
and she said, "i see you every day, going to school." 
 
i didn't reply to this. 
 
and she said, "it's very nice of you to come and say hello." 
 
i didn't reply to this either because mrs. alexander was doing what is called chatting, where people say 
things to each other which aren't questions and answers and aren't connected. 
 
then she said, "even if it's only because you're doing detective work." 
 
and i said, "thank you" again. 

 
and i was about to turn and walk away when she said, "i have a grandson your age." 
 
i tried to do chatting by saying, "my age is 15 years and 3 months and 3 days." 
 
and she said, "well, almost your age." 
 
then we said nothing for a little while unt

that's only because they lived in sewers and stowed away on ships coming from foreign countries where 
there were strange diseases. but rats are very clean. toby is always washing himself. and you don't have 
to  take  him  out  for  walks.  i  just  let  him  run  around  my  room  so  that  he  gets  some  exercise.  and 
sometimes he sits on my shoulder or hides in my sleeve like it's a burrow. but rats don't live in burrows in 
nature." 
 
mrs. alexander said, "do you want to come in for tea?" 
 
and i said, "i don't go into other people's houses." 
 
and she said, "well, maybe i could bring some out here. do you like lemon squash?" 
 
i replied, "i only like orange squash." 
 
and she said, "luckily i have some of that as well. and what about battenberg?"

she said, "it's a kind of cake. it has four pink and yellow squares in the middle and it has marzipan icing

but it wasn't the end of the book because five days later i saw 5 red cars in a row, which made it a super 
good day, and i knew that something special was going to happen. nothing special happened at school 
so i knew something special was going to happen after school. and when i got home i went down to the 
shop at the end of our road to buy some licorice laces and a milky bar with my pocket money. 
 
and when i had bought my licorice laces and a milky bar i turned round and saw mrs. alexander, the old 
lady  from  number  39,  who  was  in  the  shop  as  well.  she  wasn't  wearing  jeans  now.  she  was  wearing  a 
dress like a normal old lady. and she smelled of cooking. 
 
she said, "what happened to you the other day?" 
 
i asked, "which day?" 
 
and she said, "i came out again and you'd gone. i had to eat all the biscuits myself." 
 
i said, "i went away." 
 
and she said, "i gathered that." 
 
i said, "i thought you might ring the police." 
 
and she said, "why on earth woul

d i do that?" 
 
and  i  said,  "because  i  was  poking  my  nose  into  other  people's  business  and  father  said  i  shouldn't 
investigate who killed wellington. and a policeman gave me a caution and if i get into trouble again it 
will be a lot worse because of the caution." 
 
then the indian lady behind the counter said to mrs. alexander, "can i help you?" and mrs. alexander 
said she'd like a pint of milk and a packet of jaffa cakes and i went out of the shop. 
 
when i was outside the shop i saw that mrs. alexander's dachshund was sitting on the pavement. it was 
wearing a little coat made out of tartan material, which is scottish and check. she had tied its lead to the 
drainpipe next to the door. i like dogs, so i bent down and i said hello to her dog and it licked my hand. 
its tongue was rough and wet and it liked the smell on my trousers and started sniffing

 them. 
 
then mrs. alexander came outside and said, "his name is ivor." 
 
i didn't say anything. 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "you're very shy, aren't you, christopher." 
 
and i said, "i'm not allowed to talk to you." 
 
and she said, "don't worry. i'm not going to tell the police and i'm not going to tell your father, because 
there's nothing wrong with having a chat. having a chat is just being friendly, isn't it." 
 
i said, "i can't do chatting." 
 
then she said, "do you like computers?" 
 
and i said, "yes. i like computers. i have a computer at home in my bedroom." 

 
and she said, "i know. i can see y

ou sitting at your computer in your bedroom sometimes when i look 
across the street." 
 
then she untied ivor's lead from the drainpipe. 
 
i wasn't going to say anything because i didn't want to get into trouble. 
 
then  i  thought  that  this  was  a  super  good  day  and  something  special  hadn't  happened  yet,  so  it  was 
possible that talking to mrs. alexander was the special thing that was going to happen. and i thought that 
she  might  tell  me  something  about  wellington  or  about  mr.  shears  without  me  asking  her,  so  that 
wouldn't be breaking my promise. 
 
so i said, "and i like maths and looking after toby. and also i like outer space and i like being on my 
own." 
 
and she said, "i bet you're very good at maths, aren't you." 
 
and i said, "i am. i'm going to do my a-level maths next month. and i'm going to get an a grade." 
 
and
 
 ___________________________
 
 mrs. alexander said, "really? a-level maths?" 
 
i replied, "yes. i don't tell lies." 
 
and she said, "i apologize. i didn't mean to suggest that you were lying. i just wondered if i heard you 
correctly. i'm a little deaf sometimes." 
 
and i said, "i remember. you told me." and then i said, "i'm the first person to do an a level from my 
school because it's a special school." 
 
and she said, "well, i am very impressed. and i hope you do get an a." 
 
and i said, "i will. " 
 
then she said, "and the other

 thing i know about you is that your favorite color is not yellow." 
 
and i said, "no. and it's not brown either. my favorite color is red. and metal color." 
 
then ivor did a poo and mrs. alexander picked it up with her hand inside a little plastic bag and then she 
turned the plastic bag inside out and tied a knot in the top so that the poo was all sealed up and she didn't 
touch the poo with her hands. 
 
and then i did some reasoning. i reasoned that father had only made me do a promise about five things, 
which were 
 

1.  not to mention mr. shears's name in our house  
2.  not to go asking mrs. shears about who killed that bloody dog  
3.  not to go asking anyone about who killed th
 
 ___________________________
 
at bloody dog  
4.  not to go trespassing in other people's gardens  
5.  to stop this ridiculous bloody detective game  

 

and asking about mr. shears wasn't any of these things.   
 
and if you are a detective you have to take risks, and this was a super good day, which meant it was a 
good day for taking risks, so i said, "do you know mr. shears?" which was like chatting. 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "not really, no. i mean, i knew him well enough to say hello and talk to a little 
in the street, but i didn't know much about him. i think he worked in a bank. the national westminster. 
in town." 
 
and  i  said,  "father  says  that  he  is  an  evil  man.  do  you  know  why  he  said  that?  is  mr.  shears  an  evil 
man?" 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "why are you asking me about mr. shears, christopher?" 
 
i didn't say anything because i didn't want to be investigating wellington's
 
 ___________________________
 
 murder and that was the reason 
i was asking about mr. shears. 
 
but mrs. alexander said, "is this about wellington?" 
 
and i nodded because that didn't count as being a detective. 
 
mrs. alexander didn't say anything. she walked to the little red box on a pole next to the gate to the park 
and she put ivor's poo into the box, which was a brown thing inside a red thing, which made my head feel 
funny so i didn't look. then she walked back to me. 
 
she sucked in a big breath and said, "perhaps it would be best not to talk about these things, christopher." 
 
and i asked, "why not?" 
 
and  she  said,  "because."  then  she  stopped  and  decided  to  start  saying  a  different  sentence.
 
 ___________________________
 
  "because 
maybe your father is right and you shouldn't go around asking questions about this." 
 
and i asked, "why?" 
 
and she said, "because obviously he is going to find it quite upsetting." 
 
and i said, "why is he going to find it upsetting?" 
 
then she sucked in another big breath and said, "because. . . because i think you know why your father 
doesn't like mr. shears very much." 
 
then i asked, "did mr. shears kill mother?" 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "kill her?" 
 
and i said, "yes. did he kill mother?" 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "no. no. of course he didn't kill your mother." 
 
and i said, "but did he give her stress so that she died of a heart attack?" 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "i honestly don't know what you're talking about, christopher." 
 
and i said, "or did he hurt her so that she had to go into hospital?" 

 
and mrs. alexander said, "did she have to go into hospital?" 
 
and i said, "yes. and it wasn't very serious at f
 
 ___________________________
 
irst, but she had a heart attack when she was in hospital." 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "oh my goodness." 
 
i said, "and she died." 
 
and mrs. alexander said "oh my goodness" again, and then she said, "oh, christopher, i am so, so sorry. 
i never realized." 
 
then  i  asked  her,  "why  did  you  say  'i  think  you  know  why  your  father  doesn't  like  mr.  shears  very 
much'?" 
 
mrs. alexander put her hand over her  mouth and said, "oh dear, dear, dear." but she didn't answer my 
question. 
 
so i asked her the same question again, because in a murder mystery novel when someone doesn't want to 
answer a question it is because they are trying to keep a secret or trying to stop someone from getting into 
trouble, which means that the answers to those questions are the most important answers of all, and that is 
why the detective has to put that person under pressure. 
 
but mrs. alexan
 
 ___________________________
 
der still didn't answer. instead she asked me a question. she said, "so you don't know?" 
 
and i said, "don't know what?" 
 
she  replied,  "christopher,  look,  i  probably  shouldn't  be  telling  you  this."  then  she  said,  "perhaps  we 
should take a little walk in the park together. this is not the place to be talking about this kind of thing." 
 
i was nervous. i did not know mrs. alexander. i knew that she was an old lady and that she liked dogs. 
but she was a stranger. and i never go into the park on my own because it is dangerous and people inject 
drugs behind the public toilets in the corner. i wanted to go home and go up to my room and feed toby 
and practice some maths. 
 
but i was excited, too. because i thought she might tell me a secret. and the secret might be about who 
killed wellington. or about mr. shears. and if she did that i might have more evidence against him

, or be 
able to exclude him from my investigations. 
 
so because it was a super good day i decided to walk into the park with mrs. alexander, even though it 
scared me. 
 
when we were inside the park mrs. alexander stopped walking and said, "i am going to say something to 
you and you must promise not to tell your father that i told you this." 
 
i asked, "why?" 
 
and she said, "i shouldn't have said what i said. and if i don't explain, you'll carry on wondering what i 
meant. and you might ask your father. and i don't want you to do that because i don't want you to upset 
him. so i'm going to explain why i said what i said. but before i do that you have to promise not to tell 
anyone i said this to you.
 
 ___________________________
 
" 
 
i asked, "why?" 
 

and she said, "christopher, please, just trust me." 
 
and i said, "i promise." because if mrs. alexander told  me who killed wellington, or she told me that 
mr. shears had really killed mother, i could still go to the police and tell them because you are allowed to 
break a promise if someone has committed a crime and you know about it. 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "your mother, before she died, was very good friends with mr. shears." 
 
and i said, "i know." 
 
and she said, "no, christopher. i'm not sure that you do. i mean that they were very good friends. very, 
very good friends." 
 
i thought about this for a while and said, "do you mean that they were doing sex?" 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "yes, christopher. that is what i mean." 
 
then she didn't say anything for about 30 seconds. then she said, "i'm sorry, christopher. i really didn't

an to say anything that was going to upset you. but i wanted to explain. why i said what i said. you 
see, i thought you knew. that's why your father thinks that mr. shears is an evil man. and that will be 
why he doesn't want you going around talking to people about mr. shears. because that will bring back 
bad memories." 
 
and  i  said,  "was  that  why  mr.  shears  left  mrs.  shears,  because  he  was  doing  sex  with  someone  else 
when he was married to mrs. shears?" 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "yes, i expect so." 
 
then she said, "i'm sorry, christopher. i really am." 
 
and i said, "i think i should go now." 
 
and she said, "are you ok, christopher?" 
 
and i said, "i'm scared of being in the park with you because you're a stranger." 
 
and she said, "i'm not a stranger, christopher, i'm a friend." 
 
and i said, "i'm going to go home now." 
 
and she said, "if you want to talk about this you can come and see me anytime you want. you only have 
to knock on my door."

finger of his left hand and he smelled of something i do not know the name of which father 
often smells of when he comes home from work. 
 
i put my licorice laces and my milky bar in my special food box on the shelf, which father is not allowed 
to touch because it is mine. 
 
then father said, "and what have you been up to, young man?" 
 
and i said, "i went to the shop to get some licorice laces and a milky bar." 
 
and he said, "you were a long time." 
 
and  i  said,  "i  talked  to  mrs.  alexander's  dog  outside  the  shop.  and  i  stroked  him  and  he  sniffed  my 
trousers." which was another white lie. 
 
then rhodri said to me, "god, you do get the third degree, don't you." 
 
but i didn't know what the third degree was. 
 
and he said, "so, how are you doing, captain?" 
 
and i said, "i'm doing very well, thank you," which is what you're meant to say. 
 
and he said, "what's 251 times 864?" 
 
and i thought about this and i said,"216,864." because it was a really easy sum because

that  night  i  wrote  some  more  of  my  book,  and  the  next  morning  i  took  it  into  school  so  that  siobhan 
could read it and tell me if i had made mistakes with the spelling and the grammar. 
 
siobhan  read  the  book  during  morning  break  when  she  has  a  cup  of  coffee  and  sits  at  the  edge  of  the 
playground with the other teachers. and after morning break she came and sat down next to me and said 
she had read the bit about my conversation with mrs. alexander and she said, "have you told your father 
about this?" 
 
and i replied, "no." 
 
and she said, "are you going to tell your father about this?" 
 
and i replied, "no." 
 
and she said, "good. i think that's a good idea, christopher." and then she said, "did it make you sad to 
find this out?" 
 
and i asked, "find what out?" 
 
and she said, "did it make you upset to find out that your mother and mr. shears had an affair?" 
 
and i said, "no." 
 
and she said, "are you telling the truth, christ

 on the kitchen table because i was too interested in the blue 
planet video. this is what is called relaxing your guard, and it is what you must never do if you are a 
detective. 
 
it was 5:54 p.m. when father came back into the living room. he said, "what is this?" but he said it very 
quietly and i didn't realize that he was angry because he wasn't shouting. 
 
he was holding the book in his right hand. 
 
i said, "it's a book i'm writing." 
 
and he said, "is this true? did you talk to mrs. alexander?" he said this very quietly as well, so i still 
didn't realize that he was angry. 
 
and i said, "yes." 
 
then he said, "holy fucking jesus, christopher. how stupid are you?" 
 

this is what siobhan says is called a rhetorical question. it has a question mark at the end, but you are not 
meant to answer it because the person who is asking it already knows the answer. it is difficult to spot a 
rhetorical question. 
 
then father said, "what the fuck did i tell you, christopher?" this was mu

but i couldn't think. 
 
and father said, "not to go around sticking your fucking nose into other people's business. and what do 
you do? you go around sticking your nose into other people's business. you go around raking up the past 
and  sharing  it  with  every  tom,  dick  and  harry  you  bump  into.  what  am  i  going  to  do  with  you, 
christopher? what the fuck am i going to do with you?" 
 
i said, "i was just doing chatting with mrs. alexander. i wasn't doing investigating." 
 
and he said, "i ask you to do one thing for me, christopher. one thing." 
 
and i said, "i didn't want to talk to mrs. alexander. it was mrs. alexander who --" 
 
but father interrupted me and grabbed hold of my arm really hard. 
 
father had never grabbed hold of me like that before. mother had hit me sometimes because she was a 
very  hot-tempered  person,  which  means  that  she  got  angry  more  quickly  than  other  people  and  she 
shouted  more  ofte

 i couldn't go home again. 
 
and i decided that i couldn't go and live with siobhan because she couldn't look after  me when school 
was closed because she was a teacher and not a friend or a member of my family. 
 
and  i  decided  that  i  couldn't  go  and  live  with  uncle  terry  because  he  lived  in  sunderland  and  i  didn't 
know how to get to sunderland and i didn't like uncle terry because he smoked cigarettes and stroked 
my hair. 
 
and i decided i couldn't go and live with mrs. alexander because she wasn't a friend or a member of my 
family even if she had a dog, because i couldn't stay overnight in her house or use her toilet because she 
had used it and she was a stranger. 
 
and then i thought that i could go and live with mother because she was my family and i knew where she 
lived  because  i  could  remember  the  address  from  the  letters,  which  was  451c  chapter  road,  london 
nw2 5ng. except that she lived in london and i'd never been to london before. i'd only b

because it was a long journey and i wouldn't know where to get food from. and then i thought i would 
need someone to look after toby when i went to london because i couldn't take him with me. 
 
and  then  i  formulated  a  plan.  and  that  made  me  feel  better  because  there  was  something  in my  head 
that had an order and a pattern and i just had to follow the instructions one after the other. 
 
i stood up and i made sure there was no one in the street. then i went to mrs. alexander's house, which is 
next door to mrs. shears's house, and i knocked on the door. 
 
then mrs. alexander opened the door, and she said, "christopher, what on earth has happened to you?" 
 
and i said, "can you look after toby for me?" 
 
and she said, "who's toby?" 
 
and i said, "toby's my pet rat." 
 
then mrs. alexander said, "oh. . . oh yes i remember now. you told me." 
 
then  i  held  toby's  cage  up  and  said,  "this  is  him."  mrs.  alexander  took  a  step  backward  into  her

caffeine and theobromine in it, which are methylxanthines, and it's poisonous for rats in large quantities. 
and he needs new water in his bottle every day, too. and he won't mind being in someone else's house 
because he's an animal. and he likes to come out of his cage, but it doesn't matter if you don't take him 
out." 
 
then mrs. alexander said, "why do you need someone to look after toby, christopher?" 
 
and i said, "i'm going to london." 
 
and she said, "how long are you going for?" 
 
and i said, "until i go to university." 
 
and she said, "can't you take toby with you?"

and i said, "i'm going to live with mother."

and i said, "i thought she was dead, but she was still alive. and father lied to me. and also he said he 
killed wellington." 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "oh, my goodness." 
 
and  i  said,  "i'm  going  to  live  with  my  mother  because  father  killed  wellington  and  he  lied  and  i'm 
frightened of being in the house with him." 
 
and mrs. alexander said, "is your mother here?"
