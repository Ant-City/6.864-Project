 rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption
there's a guy like me in every state and federal prison in america, i guess--i'm
the guy who can get it for you. tailor made cigarettes, a bag of reefer if you're
partial to that, a bottle of brandy to celebrate your son or daughter's high
school graduation, or anything else within reason, that is. it wasn't always that way.
i came to shawshank when i was just twenty, and i am one of the few people in
our happy little family willing to own up to what he did. i committed murder. i

woman found both of them dead in
bed. each had been shot four times.
it was that last fact that militated more against andy than any of the others.
the da with the political aspirations made a great deal of it in his opening
statement and his closing summation. andrew dufresne, he said, was not a wronged
husband seeking a hot-blooded revenge against his cheating wife; that, the da
said, could be understood, if not condoned. but this revenge had been of a much
colder type. consider! the da thundered at the jury. four and four! not six
shots, but eight! he had fired the gun empty . . . and then stopped to reload so
he could shoot each of them again! four for him and four for her, the
portland sun blared. the boston register dubbed him the “even-steven killer.”
a clerk from the wise pawnshop in lewiston testified that he had sold a six-shot
.38 police special to andrew dufresne just two days before the double murder. a
bartender from the country club bar testified that andy had come in a

and this cool
admission of how well-planned his investigation had been did him no good at all
in the eyes of the jury.
after returning the friend's car and picking up his own, he had gone home. linda
had been in bed, reading a book. he asked her how her trip to portland had been.
she replied that it had been fun, but she hadn't seen anything she liked well
enough to buy. "that's when i knew for sure," andy told the breathless
spectators. he spoke in the same calm, remote voice in which he delivered almost
all of his testimony.
"what was your frame of mind in the seventeen days between then and the night
your wife was murdered?" andy's lawyer asked him.
"i was in great distress," andy said calmly, coldly. like a man reciting a
shopping list he said that he had considered suicide, and had even gone so far
as to purchase a gun in lewiston on september 8th.
his lawyer then invited him to tell the jury what had happened after his wife
left to meet glenn quentin on the night of the murders. and

eve. then that bottle would also come to me with instructions to pass it
on. four drinks a year-and that is the behavior of a man who has been bitten
hard by the bottle. hard enough to draw blood.
he told the jury that on the night of the tenth he had been so drunk he could
only remember what had happened in little isolated snatches. he had gotten drunk
that afternoon-"i took on a double helping of dutch courage" is how he put
it-before taking on linda.
after she left to meet quentin, he remembered deciding to confront them. on the
way to quentin's bungalow, he swung into the country club for a couple of quick
ones. he could not, he said, remember telling the bartender he could "read about
the rest of it in the papers," or saying anything to him at all. he remembered
buying beer in the handy-pik, but not the dishtowels. "why would i want
dishtowels?" he asked, and one of the papers reported that three of the lady
jurors shuddered.
later, much later, he speculated to me about the clerk who

subject of those dishtowels, and i think it's worth jotting down what he said.
"suppose that, during their canvass for witnesses," andy said one day in the
exercise yard, "they stumble on this fellow who sold me the beer that night. by
then three days have gone by. the facts of the case have been broadsided in all
the papers. maybe they ganged up on the guy, five or six cops, plus the dick
from the attorney general's office, plus the da's assistant. memory is a pretty
subjective thing, red. they could have started out with 'isn't it possible that
he purchased four or five dishtowels?' and worked their way up from there. if
enough people want you to remember something, that can be a pretty powerful
persuader."
i agreed that it could.
"but there's one even more powerful," andy went on in that musing way of his. "i
think it's at least possible that he convinced himself. it was the limelight.

s star turn in court. i'm not saying that he deliberately falsified
his story, or perjured himself. i think it's possible that he could have passed
a lie detector test with flying colors, or sworn on his mother's sacred name
that i bought those dishtowels. but still . . . memory is such a goddam
subjective thing.
"i know this much: even though my own lawyer thought i had to be lying about
half my story, he never bought that business about the dishtowels. it's crazy on
the face of it. i was pig-drunk, too drunk to have been thinking about muffling
the gunshots. if i'd done it, i just would have let them rip."
he went up to the turnout and parked there. he drank beer and smoked cigarettes.
he watched the lights

downstairs in quentin's place go out. he watched a single
light go on upstairs . . . and fifteen minutes later he watched that one go out.
he said he could guess the rest.
"mr. dufresne, did you then go up to glenn quentin's house and kill the two of
them?" his lawyer thundered.
"no, i did not," andy answered. by midnight, he said, he was sobering up. he was
also feeling the first signs of a bad hangover. he decided to go home and sleep
it off and think about the whole thing in a more adult fashion the next day. "at
that time, as i drove home, i was beginning to think that the wisest course
would be to simply let her go to reno and get her divorce."
"thank you, mr. dufresne."
the da popped up.

 mr. dufresne?"
"yes. "
"that's also rather convenient, isn't it?"
at that, according to the papers, andy displayed one of the few slight emotional
reactions he allowed himself during the entire six-week period of the trial. a
slight, bitter smile crossed his face.
"since i am innocent of this crime, sir, and since i am telling the truth about
throwing my gun into the river the day before the crime took place, then it
seems to me decidedly inconvenient that the gun was never found."
the da hammered at him for two days. he re-read the handy-pik clerk's testimony
about the dishtowels to andy. andy repeated that he could not recall buying
them, but admitted that he also couldn't remember not buying them.
was it true that andy and linda dufresne had taken out a joint insurance policy
in early 1947 ? yes, that was true. and if acquitted, wasn't it true that andy
stood to gain fifty thousand dollars in benefits? true. and wasn't it true that

as simple as that. and he was condemned to spend the rest of his life in
shawshank - or the part of it that mattered. five years later he began to have
parole hearings, and he was turned down just as regular as clockwork in spite of
being a model prisoner. getting a pass out of shawshank when you've got murder
stamped on your admittance-slip is slow work, as slow as a river eroding a rock.

he called him. he set jake free a day before he, sherwood, that is, was to walk,
and jake flew away just as pretty as you could want. but about a week after
sherwood bolton left our happy little family, a friend of mine called me over to
the west corner of the exercise yard, where sherwood used to hang out. a bird
was lying there like a very small pile of dirty bed-linen. it looked starved. my
friend said: "isn't that jake, red?" it was. that pigeon was just as dead as a
turd.
i remember the first time andy dufresne got in touch with me for something; i
remember like it was yesterday. that wasn't the time he wanted rita hayworth,
though. that came later. in that summer of 1948 he came around for something
else.
most of my deals are done right there in the exercise yard, and that's where

square, ninety yards on a side. the north side is the o

vehicles-not to mention the private cars of the screws, the administration officers . . .
and, on more than one occasion, those of the parole board.
the east side is a thick stone wall full of tiny slit windows. cellblock 5 is on
the other side of that wall. the west side is administration and the infirmary.
shawshank has never been as overcrowded as most prisons, and back in '48 it was
only filled to something like two-thirds capacity, but at any given time there
might be eighty to a hundred and twenty cons on the yard- playing toss with a
football or a baseball, shooting craps, jawing at each other, making deals. on
sunday the place was even more crowded; on sunday the place would have looked
like a country holiday . . . if there had been any women.
it was on a sunday that andy first came to me. i had just finished talking to
elmore armitage, a fellow who often came in handy to me, about a radio when andy
walked up. i knew who he was, of course; he had a reputation for being a sno

and a cold fish. people were saying he was marked for trouble already. one of
the people saying so was bogs diamond, a bad man to have on your case. andy had
no cellmate, and i'd heard that was just the way he wanted it, although people
were already saying he thought his shit smelled sweeter than the ordinary. but i
don't have to listen to rumors about a man when i can judge him for myself.
"hello," he said. "i'm andy dufresne." he offered his hand and i shook it. he
wasn't a man to waste time being social; he got right to the point. "i
understand that you're a man who knows how to get things . "
i agreed that i was able to locate certain items from time to time.
"how do you do that?" andy asked.
"sometimes," i said, "things just seem to come into my hand. i can't explain it.
unless it's because i'm irish."
he smiled a little at that. "i wonder if you could get me a rock hammer. "
"what would that be, and why would you want it?"

 
 ___________________________
 
e probably knew it, too, but he wasn't
kowtowing or sucking up to me, and i respected him for that.
"fair enough. i'll tell you what it is and why i want it. a rock hammer looks
like a miniature pickaxe-about so long." he held his hands about a foot apart,
and that was when i first noticed how neatly kept his nails were. "it's got a
small sharp pick on one end and a flat, blunt hammerhead on the other. i want it
because i like rocks."
"rocks, " i said.
"squat down here a minute," he said.
i humored him. we hunkered down on our haunches like indians.
andy took a handful of exercise yard dirt and began to sift it between his neat
hands, so it emerged in a fine cloud. small pebbles were left over, one or two
sparkly, the rest dull and plain. one of the dull ones was quartz, but it was
only dull until you'd rubbed it clean. then it had a nice milky glow. andy did
the cleaning and then tossed it to me. i caught it and named it.
"quartz, sure," he said. "and look. mica. shale. silted granite. h

they'd take it away. what are you going to do, just sit
down here in the yard and start bangin' away?"
"oh, i believe i can do a lot better than that."
i nodded. that part of it really wasn't my business, anyway. a man engages my
services to get him something. whether he can keep it or not after i get it is
his business.
"how much would an item like that go for?" i asked. i was beginning to enjoy his
quiet, low-key style. when you've spent ten years in stir, as i had then, you
can get awfully tired of the bellowers and the braggarts and the loud-mouths.
yes, i think it would be fair to say i liked andy from the first.
"eight dollars in any rock-and-gem shop," he said, "but i realize that in a
business like yours you work on a cost-plus basis-"
"cost plus ten per cent is my going rate, but i have to go up some on a dangerous
item. for something like the gadget you're talking about, it takes a little more
goose-grease to get the wheel turning. let's say ten dollars.'

ed at him, smiling a little. "have you got ten dollars?"
"i do," he said quietly.
a long time after, i discovered that he had better than five hundred. he had
brought it in with him. when they check you at this hotel, one of the bellhops
is obliged to bend you over ant take a look up your works-but there are a lot of
works, and, not to put too fine a point on it, a man who is really determined

unless the bellhop you happen to draw is in the mood to pull on a rubber glove
and go prospecting.

 percentage in it."
he nodded and walked away. three days later he walked u] beside me in the
exercise yard during the laundry's morning break he didn't speak or even look my
way, but pressed a picture of the honorable alexander hamilton into my hand
as neatly as a good magician does a card-trick. he was a man who adapted fast.
i got him his rock-hammer. i had it in my cell for one night, and it was just as he described
it. it was no tool for escape (it would have taken a man just about six hundred years to
tunnel under the wall using that rock-hammer, i figured), but i still felt some misgivings. if
you planted that pickaxe end in a man's head, he would surely never
listen to fibber mcgee and molly on the radio again. and andy had already begun having
trouble with the sisters. i hoped it wasn't them he was wanting the rockhammer
for.

in the end, i trusted my judgment. early the next morning, twenty minutes before
the wake-up horn went off, i slipped the rock-hammer and a package of c

e was swollen half-shut, and there
was an ugly washboard scrape across one cheek. he was having his troubles with
the sisters, all right, but he never mentioned them. "thanks for the tool," he
said, and walked away.
i watched him curiously. he walked a few steps, saw something in the dirt, bent
over, and picked it up. it was a small rock. prison fatigues, except for those
worn by mechanics when they're on the job, have no pockets. but there are ways
to get around that. the little pebble disappeared up andy's sleeve and didn't
come down. i admired that . . . and i admired him. in spite of the problems he
was having, he was going on with his life. there are thousands who don't or
won't or can't, and plenty of them aren't in prison, either. and i noticed that,
although his face looked as if a twister had happened to it, his hands were
still neat and clean, the nails well-kept.

i didn't see much of him over the next six months; andy spent a lot of that time
in solitary.

in a lot of pens they are known as bull queers or jailhouse susies-just lately
the term in fashion is "killer queens." but in shawshank they were always the
sisters. i don't know why, but other than the name i guess there was no
difference.
it comes as no surprise to most these days that there's a lot of buggery going
on inside the walls-except to some of the new fish, maybe, who have the
misfortune to be young, slim, good-looking, and unwary-but homosexuality, like
straight sex, comes in a hundred different shapes and forms. there are men who
can't stand to be without sex of some kind and turn to another man to keep from
going crazy. usually what follows is an arrangement between two fundamentally
heterosexual men, although i've sometimes wondered if they are quite as
heterosexual as they thought they were going to be when they get back to their
wives or their girlfriends.
there are also men who get "turned" in prison. in the current parlance they "go
gay," or "come out of the closet. "

peted for fiercely.
and then there are the sisters.
they are to prison society what the rapist is to the society outside the walls.
they're usually long-timers, doing hard bullets for brutal crimes. their prey is
the young, the weak, and the inexperienced . . . or, as in the case of andy
dufresne, the weak-looking. their hunting grounds are the showers, the cramped,
tunnel-like areaway behind the industrial washers in the laundry, sometimes the
infirmary. on more than one occasion rape has occurred in the closet-sized
projection booth behind the auditorium. most often what the sisters take by
force they could have had for free, if they wanted it that way; those who have
been turned always seem to have "crushes" on one sister or another, like teenage
girls with their sinatras, presleys, or redfords. but for the sisters, the joy
has always been in taking it by force . . . and i guess it always will be.
because of his small size and fair good looks (and maybe also because of that
very qualit

y of self-possession i had admired), the sisters were after andy from
the day he walked in. if this was some kind of fairy story, i'd tell you that
andy fought the good fight until they left him alone. i wish i could say that,
but i can't. prison is no fairy-tale world.
the first time for him was in the shower less than three days after he joined
our happy shawshank family. just a lot of slap and tickle that time, i
understand. they like to size you up before they make their real move, like

 as weak and hamstrung as it looks.
andy punched back and bloodied the lip of a big, hulking sister named bogs
diamond-gone these many years since to who knows where. a guard broke it up
before it could go any further, but bogs promised to get him-and bogs did.
the second time was behind the washers in the laundry. a lot has gone on in that
long, dusty, and narrow space over the years; the guards know about it and just
let it be. it's dim and littered with bags of washing and bleaching compound,
drums of hexlite catalyst, as harmless as salt if your hands are dry, murderous
as battery acid if they're wet. the guards don't like to go back there. there's
no room to maneuver, and one of the first things they teach them when they come
to work in a place like this is to never let the cons get you in a place where
you can't back up.
bogs wasn't there that day, but henley backus, who had been washroom foreman
down there since 1922, told me that fou

diamond's cell.
of course a job like that would have cost a lot of money. not by outside
standards, no. prison economics are on a smaller scale. when you've been in here
awhile, a dollar bill in your hand looks like a twenty did outside. my guess is
that, if bogs was done, it cost someone a serious piece of change-fifteen bucks,
we'll say, for the turnkey, and two or three apiece for each of the lump-up
guys.
i'm not saying it was andy dufresne, but i do know that he brought in five
hundred dollars when he came, and he was a banker in the straight world-a man
who understands better than the rest of us the ways in which money can become
power.
and i know this: after the beating-the three broken ribs, the hemorrhaged eye,
the sprained back, and the dislocated hip-bogs diamond left andy alone. in fact,
after that he left everyone pretty much alone. he got to be like a high wind in
the summertime, all bluster and no bite. you could say, in fact, that he turned
into a "weak sister."

cloth. rock-blankets, indeed.
it was about five months later that andy asked if i could get him rita hayworth.
that conversation took place in the auditorium, during a movie-show. nowadays we
get the movie-shows once or twice a week, but back then the shows were a monthly
event. usually the movies we got had a morally uplifting message to them, and
this one, the lost weekend, was no different. the moral was that it's dangerous
to drink. it was a moral we could take some comfort in.
andy maneuvered to get next to me, and about halfway through the show he leaned
a little closer and asked if i could get him rita hayworth. i'll tell you the
truth, it kind of tickled me. he was usually cool, calm, and collected, but that
night he was jumpy as hell, almost embarrassed, as if he was asking me to get
him a load of trojans or one of those sheepskin-lined gadgets that are supposed
to "enhance your solitary pleasure," as the magazines put it. he seemed
overcharged, a man on the verge of blowing his

"how soon?"
"a week. maybe less."
"okay. " but he sounded disappointed, as if he had been hoping had one stuffed
down my pants right then. "how much?"
i quoted him the wholesale price. i could afford to give him this one at cost;
he'd been a good customer, what with his rock-hammer and his rock-blankets.
furthermore, he'd been a good boy-o more than one night when he was having his
problems with bogs rooster, and the rest, i wondered how long it would be before
h used the rock-hammer to crack someone's head open.
posters are a big part of my business, just behind the booze an, cigarettes,
usually half a step ahead of the reefer. in the sixties the business exploded in
every direction, with a lot of people wanting funky hang-ups like jimi hendrix,
bob dylan, that easy rider poster. but mostly it's girls; one pin-up queen after
another.
a few days after andy spoke to me, a laundry driver i did business with back
then brought

in better than sixty posters, most of them rita hayworths. you may
even remember the picture; sure do. rita is dressed-sort of-in a bathing suit,
one hand behind her head, her eyes half-closed, those full, sulky red lips
parted. they called it rita hayworth, but they might as well have called it
woman in heat.
the prison administration knows about the black market, in case you were
wondering. sure they do. they probably know almost much about my business as i
do myself. they live with it because they know that a prison is like a big

the occasion; bust, and i've done time in solitary a time or three over the year

no one liked him, as far as i could tell, except the people who had gotten him his
appointment. i heard that he was only interested in three things: compiling
statistics for a book (which was later published by a small new england outfit
called light side press, where he probably had to pay to have it done), which
team won the intramural baseball championship each september, and getting a
death-penalty law passed in maine. a regular bear for the death penalty was
george dunahy. he was fired from the job in 1953, when it came out he was
running a discount auto-repair service down in the prison garage and splitting
the profits with byron hadley and greg stammas. hadley and stammas came out of
that one okay-they were old hands at keeping their asses covered-but dunahy took
a walk. no one was sorry to see him go, but nobody was exactly pleased to see
greg stammas step into his shoes, either. he was a short man with a tight, hard
gut and the coldest brown eyes you ever saw. he always h

room and couldn't quite
manage it. during stammas's tenure as warden there was a lot of brutality at
shawshank, and although i have no proof, i believe there were maybe half a dozen
moonlight burials in the stand of scrub forest that lies east of the prison.
dunahy was bad, but greg stammas was a cruel, wretched, cold-hearted man.
he and byron hadley were good friends. as warden, george dunahy was nothing but
a posturing figurehead; it was stammas, and through him, hadley, who actually
administered the prison.
hadley was a tall, shambling man with thinning red hair. he sunburned easily
and he talked loud and if you didn't move fast enough to suit him, he'd clout you
with his stick. on that day, our third on the roof, he was talking to another
guard named mert entwhistle.
hadley had gotten some amazingly good news, so he was griping about it. that was
his style-he was a thankless man with not a good word for anyone, a man who was
convinced that the whole world was against him. the world ha

e old question, the one that's supposed to define your
outlook on life when you answer it. for byron hadley the answer would always be
half empty, the glass is half empty. forever and ever, amen. if you gave him a
cool drink of apple cider, he'd think about vinegar. if you told him his wife
had always been faithful to him, he'd tell you it was because she was so damn
ugly.
so there he sat, talking to mert entwhistle loud enough for all of us to hear,
his broad white forehead already starting to redden with the sun. he had one
hand thrown back over the low parapet surrounding the roof. the other was on the
butt of his .38.
we all got the story along with mert. it seemed that hadley's older brother had
gone off to texas some fourteen years ago and the rest of the family hadn't
heard from the son of a bitch since. they had all assumed he was dead, and good
riddance. then, a week and a half ago, a lawyer had called them long-distance
from austin. it seemed that hadley's brother had died four

months ago, and a
rich man at that ("it's frigging incredible how lucky some assholes can get,"
this paragon of gratitude on the plate-shop roof said). the money had come as a
result of oil and oil-leases, and there was close to a million dollars.
no, hadley wasn't a millionaire-that might have made even him happy, at least
for awhile-but the brother had left a pretty damned decent bequest of
thirty-five thousand dollars to each surviving member of his family back in
maine, if they could be found. not bad. like getting lucky and winning a
sweepstakes.

ays half empty. he spent most of the
morning bitching to mert about the bite that the goddam government was going to
take out of his windfall. "they'll leave me about enough to buy a new car with,"
he allowed, "and then what happens? you have to pay the damn taxes on the car,
and the repairs and maintenance, you got your goddam kids pestering you to take
'em for a ride with the top down-"
"and to drive it, if they're old enough," mert said. old mert entwhistle knew
which side his bread was buttered on, and he didn't say what must have been as
obvious to him as to the rest of us: if that money's worrying you so bad, byron
old kid old sock, i'll just take it off your hands. after all, what are friends
for?
"that's right, wanting to drive it, wanting to learn to drive on it, for
chrissake," byron said with a shudder. "then what happens at the end of the
year? if you figured the tax wrong and you don't have enough left over to pay
the overdraft, you got to pay out of your own pocket, or maybe

he lapsed into a morose silence, thinking of what terrible bad luck he'd had to
inherit that thirty-five thousand dollars. andy dufresne had been spreading tar
with a big brush less than fifteen feet away and now he tossed it into his
pail and walked over to where mert and hadley were sitting.
we all tightened up, and i saw one of the other screws, tim youngblood, drag his
hand down to where his pistol was holstered. one of the fellows in the sentry
tower struck his partner on the arm and they both turned, too. for one moment i
thought andy was going to get shot, or clubbed, or both.
then he said, very softly, to hadley: "do you trust your wife?"
hadley just stared at him. he was starting to get red in the face, and i knew
that was a bad sign. in about three seconds he was going to pull his billy club
and give andy the butt end of it right in the solar plexus, where that big bundle
of nerves is. a hard eno

andy just looked at him, very calm and still. his eyes were like ice. it was as
if he hadn't heard. and i found myself wanting to tell him how it was, to give
him the crash course. the crash course is you never let on that you hear the
guards talking, you never try to horn in on their conversation unless you're

because we've got our own brand of equality. in prison every con's a low life, and
you have to get used to the idea if you intend to survive men like hadley and

the problem is whether or not you believe she would ever go behind your back,

hadley got up. mert got up. tim youngblood got up. hadley's face was as red as

mert. we're throwing this sucker over the side."

they laid hold of him, mert on the right arm, hadley on the left. andy didn't
resist. his eyes never left hadley's red face.

composed voice, "there's not a reason why you shouldn't have every cent of that
money. final score, mr. byron hadley thirty-five thousand, uncle sam zip."
mert started to drag him toward the edge.
hadley just stood there. for a moment andy was like a rope between them in a tug-of-war
game. then hadley said, "hold on one second, mert. what do you mean, boy?"
"i mean, if you've got your thumb on your wife, you can giv

banker who shot his wife. why should i believe a smart banker like you? so i can
wind up in here breaking rocks right alongside you? you'd like that, wouldn't
you?"
andy said quietly: "if you went to jail for tax evasion, you'd go to a federal
penitentiary, not shawshank. but you won't. the tax-free gift to the spouse is a
perfectly legal loophole. i've done dozens . . . no, hundreds of them. it's
meant primarily for people with small businesses to pass on, or for people who

"i think you're lying," hadley said, but he didn't-you could see he didn't.
there was an emotion dawning on his face, something that was grotesque overlying
that long, ugly countenance and that receding, sunburned brow. an almost obscene
emotion when seen on the features of byron hadley. it was hope.

set it up for you nearly free of charge. the price would be three beers apiece
for my co-workers-"
"co-workers," mert said, and let out a rusty guffaw. he slapped his knee. a real
knee-slapper was old mert, and i hope he died of intestinal cancer in a part of
the world where morphine is as of yet undiscovered. "co-workers, ain't that

opinion. it would go down smooth, and i'm sure you'd have their gratitude."

cracked a smile.
"i'll write down the forms you need," he said. "you can get them at the post

that sounded suitably important, and hadley's chest swelled. then he glared
around at the rest of us and hollered, "what are you jimmies starin at? move

was still the best i ever had in my life. we sat and drank it and felt the sun

smiling a little. it's amazing how many men remember him that way, and amazing
how many men were on that work-crew when andy dufresne faced down byron hadley.

in five hundred dollars jammed up his back porch, but somehow that graymeat son
of a bitch managed to bring in something else as well. a sense of his own worth,
maybe, or a feeling that he would be the winner in the end . . . or maybe it was
only a sense of freedom, even inside these goddamned gray walls. it was a kind
of inner light he carried around with him. i only knew him to lose that light

ree was in animal husbandry, true enough, but college
educations in institutes of lower learning like the shank are so rare that it's
a case of beggars not being able to be choosers.
in 1952 brooksie, who had killed his wife and daughter after a losing streak at
poker back when coolidge was president, was paroled. as usual, the state in all
its wisdom had let him go long after any chance he might have had to become a
useful part of society was gone. he was sixty-eight and arthritic when he
tottered out of the main gate in his polish suit and his french shoes, his
parole papers in one hand and a greyhound bus ticket in the other. he was crying
when he left. shawshank was his world. what lay beyond its walls was as terrible
to brooks as the western seas had been to superstitious fifteenth-century
sailors. in prison, brooksie had been a person of some importance. he was the
librarian, an educated man. if he went to the kittery library and asked for a
job, they wouldn't even give him a librar
 
 ___________________________
 
i thought he would. yeah, i guess the state got its own back
on brooksie, all right. they trained him to like it inside the shithouse and
then they threw him out.
andy succeeded to brooksie's job, and he was librarian for twenty-three years.
he used the same force of will i'd seen him use on byron hadley to get what he
wanted for the library, and i saw him gradually turn one small room (which still
smelled of turpentine because it had been a paint closet until 1922 and had
never been properly aired) lined with reader's digest condensed books and
national geographies into the best prison library in new england.
he did it a step at a time. he put a suggestion box by the door and patiently
weeded out such attempts at humor as more fuk-boox pleeze and excape in 10 ez
lesions. he got hold of the things the prisoners seemed serious about. he wrote
to the major book clubs in new york and got two of them, the literary guild and
the book-of-the-month club, to send editions of all their major selec

hobbies as soap-carving, woodworking, sleight of hand, and card solitaire. he
got all the books he could on such subjects. and those two jailhouse staples,
erie stanley gardner and louis l'amour. cons never seem to get enough of the
courtroom or the open range. and yes, he did keep a box of fairly spicy
paperbacks under the checkout desk, loaning them out carefully and making sure
they always got back. even so, each new acquisition of that type was quickly

 it once every year for a million
years. stammas laughed and clapped andy on the back. "you got no million years,
old horse, but if you did, i bleeve you'd do it with that same little grin on
your face. you go on and write your letters. i'll even mail them for you if you
pay for the stamps."
which andy did. and he had the last laugh, although stammas and hadley weren't
around to see it. andy's requests for library funds were routinely turned down
until 1960, when he received a check for two hundred dollars-the senate probably
appropriated it in hopes that he would shut up and go away. vain hope. andy felt
that he had finally gotten one foot in the door and he simply redoubled his
efforts; two letters a week instead of one. in 1962 he got four hundred dollars,
and for the rest of the decade the library received seven hundred dollars a year
like clockwork. by 1971 that had risen to an even thousand. not much stacked up
against what your average small-town library receives, i guess, but a th

by the late sixties there was also a booming trade in pills, and the same
administrative crowd was involved in turning a buck on that. all of it added up
to a pretty good-sized river of illicit income. not like the pile of clandestine
bucks that must fly around a really big prison like attica or san quentin, but

not peanuts, either. and money itself becomes a problem after awhile. you can't
just stuff it into your wallet and then shell out a bunch of crumpled twenties
and dog-eared tens when you want a pool built in your back yard or an addition
put on your house. once you get past a certain point, you have to explain where
that money came from . . . and if your explanations aren't convincing enough,
you're apt to wind up wearing a number yourself.
so there was a need for andy's services. they took him out of the laundry and
installed him in the library, but if you wanted to look at it another way, they
never took him out of the laundry at all. they just set him to work w

he told me once about ten years after that day on the plate-shop roof that his
feelings about what he was doing were pretty clear, and that his conscience was
relatively untroubled. the rackets would have gone on with him or without him.
he had not asked to be sent to shawshank, he went on; he was an innocent man who
had been victimized by colossal bad luck, not a missionary or a do-gooder.
"besides, red," he told me with that same half-grin, "what i'm doing in here
isn't all that different from what i was doing outside. i'll hand you a pretty
cynical axiom: the amount of expert financial help an individual or company
needs rises in direct proportion to how many people that person or business is

"no," andy said. "i don't like the pills, either. never have. but i'm not much
of a one for cigarettes or booze, either. but i don't push the pills. i don't
bring them in, and i don't sell them once they are in. mostly it's the screws
who do that."

man who can get it. and they figure if you can get them batteries for their
transistor radios or cartons of luckies or lids of reefer, you can put them in

eorge dunahy departed the scene in a welter of newspaper headlines shouting
scandal and nest-feathering. stammas succeeded him, and for the next six
years shawshank was a kind of living hell. during the reign of greg stammas the beds in
the infirmary and the cells in the solitary wing were always full.

one day in 1958 i looked at myself in a small shaving mirror i kept in my cell
and saw a forty-year-old man looking back at me. a kid had come in back in 1938,
a kid with a big mop of carroty red hair, half-crazy with remorse, thinking
about suicide. that kid was gone. the red hair was going gray and starting to
recede. there were crow's tracks around the eyes. on that day i could see an old
man inside, waiting his time to come out. it scared me. nobody wants to grow old
in stir.
stammas went early in 1959. there had been several investigative reporters
sniffing around, and one of them even did four months under an assumed name, for
a crime made up out of whole cloth. they were getting

and convicted, he could have ended up right in here. if so, he might have lasted all
of five hours. byron hadley had gone two years earlier. the sucker had a heart
attack and took an early retirement.
andy never got touched by the stammas affair. in early 1959 a new warden was
appointed, and a new assistant warden, and a new chief of guards. for the next
eight months or so, andy was just another con again. it was during that period
that normaden, the big half-breed passamaquoddy, shared andy's cell with him.
then everything just started up again. normaden was moved out, and andy was
living in solitary splendor again. the names at the top change, but the rackets
never do.
i talked to normaden once about andy. "nice della," normaden said. it was hard
to make out anything he said because he had a harelip and a cleft palate; his
words all came out in a slush. "i liked it there. he never made fun. but he
didn't want me there. i could tell." big shrug. "i was glad to go, me. bad dra

rita hayworth hung in andy's cell until 1955, if i remember right. then it was
marilyn monroe, that picture from the seven-year itch where she's standing over
a subway grating and the warm air is flipping her skirt up. marilyn lasted until
1960, and she was considerably tattered about the edges when andy replaced her
with jayne mansfield. jayne was, you should pardon the expression, a bust. after
only a year or so she was replaced with an english actress-might have been hazel
court, but i'm not sure. in 1966 that one came down and raquel welch went up for
a record breaking six-year engagement in andy's cell. the last poster to hang
there was a pretty country-rock singer whose name was linda ronstadt.

it wasn't just her; it was that beach she was standing on. looked like she was
down in mexico somewhere. someplace quiet, where a man would be able to hear
himself think. didn't you ever feel that way about a picture, red? that you
could almost step right through it?"
i said i'd never really thought of it that way.
"maybe someday you'll see what i mean," he said, and he was right. years later i
saw exactly what he meant . . . and when i did, the first thing i thought of was
normaden, and about how he'd said it was always cold in andy's cell.
a terrible thing happened to andy in late march or early april of 1963. i have
told you that he had something that most of the other prisoners, myself
included, seemed to la

so much as crack a smile. he had a thirty-year pin from
the baptist advent church of eliot. his major innovation as the head of our
happy family was to make sure that each incoming prisoner had a new testament.
he had a small plaque on his desk, gold letters inlaid in teakwood, which said
christ is my savior. a sampler on the wall, made by his wife, read:

 his judgment cometh and that right early.
this latter sentiment cut zero ice with most of us.
we felt that the judgment had already occurred, and we would be willing to
testify with the best of them that the rock would not hide us nor the dead tree
give us shelter. he had a bible quote for every occasion, did mr. sam norton,
and whenever you meet a man like that, my best advice to you would be to grin
big and cover up your balls with both hands.
there were less infirmary cases than in the days of greg stammas, and so far as
i know the moonlight burials ceased altogether, but this is not to say that
norton was not a believer in punis

rain, as in "i'm on the sam norton grain and drain train,
boys."
the man was the foulest hypocrite that i ever saw in a high position. the
rackets i told you about earlier continued to flourish, but sam norton added his
own new wrinkles. andy knew about them all, and because we had gotten to be
pretty good friends by that time, he let me in on some of them. when andy talked
about them, an expression of amused, disgusted wonder would come over his face,
as if he were telling me about some ugly, predatory species of bug that was, by
its very ugliness and greed, somehow more comic than terrible.
it was warden norton who instituted the "inside-out" program you may have read
about some sixteen or seventeen years back; it was even written up in newsweek.
in the press it sounded like a real advance in practical corrections and
rehabilitation. there were prisoners out cutting pulpwood, prisoners repairing
bridges and causeways, prisoners constructing potato cellars. norton called it
"inside-out"

plain it to damn near every rotary and kiwanis
club in new england, especially after he got his picture in newsweek. the
prisoners called it "road-ganging," but so far as i know, none of them were ever
invited to express their views to the kiwanians or the loyal order of moose.
norton was right in there on every operation, thirty-year churchpin and all;
from cutting pulp to digging storm-drains to laying new culverts under state
highways, there was norton, skimming off the top. there were a hundred ways to
do it-men, materials, you name it. but he had it coming another way, as well.
the construction businesses in the area were deathly afraid of norton's
inside-out program, because prison labor is slave labor, and you can't compete
with that. so sam norton, he of the testaments and the thirty-year church-pin,
was passed a good many thick envelopes under the table during his sixteen-year
tenure as shawshank's warden. and when an envelope was passed, he would either

on of a whore. he gave good advice, made useful
suggestions, the money got spread around, and . . . son of a bitch! the library
would get a new set of automotive repair manuals, a fresh set of grolier
encyclopedias, books on how to prepare for the scholastic achievement tests.
and, of course, more erle stanley gardners and more louis l'amours.
and i'm convinced that what happened happened because norton just didn't want to
lose his good right hand. i'll go further: it happened because he was scared of
what might happen-what andy might say against him-if andy ever got clear of
shawshank state prison.
i got the story a chunk here and a chunk there over a space of seven years, some
of it from andy-but not all. he never wanted to talk about that part of his
life, and i don't blame him. i got parts of it from maybe half a dozen different
sources. i've said once that prisoners are nothing but slaves, but they have
that slave habit of looking dumb and keeping their ears open. i got it backwards

s trial that there had been no sign of burglary. i have a few ideas
about that. first, if you take the cash and the man it belonged to is dead, how
are you going to know anything was stolen, unless someone else can tell you it
was there to start with? second, who's to say blatch wasn't lying about that
part of it? maybe he didn't want to admit killing two people for nothing. third,
maybe there were signs of burglary and the cops either overlooked them-cops can
be pretty dumb-or deliberately covered them up so they wouldn't screw the da's
case. the guy was running for public office, remember, and he needed a
conviction to run on. an unsolved burglary-murder would have done him no good at
all.
but of the three, i like the middle one best. i've known a few elwood blatches

one a considerable amount of drinking there
once he found out about his wife's affair. there was a marina with the country
club, and for awhile in 1947 there had been a part-time grease-and-gas jockey
working there who matched tommy's description of elwood blatch. a big tall man,
mostly bald, with deep-set green eyes. a man who had an unpleasant way of
looking at you, as though he was sizing you up. he wasn't there long, andy said.
either he quit or briggs, the fellow in charge of the marina, fired him. but he
wasn't a man you forgot. he was too striking for that. 
47
so andy went to see warden norton on a rainy, windy day with big gray clouds
scudding across the sky above the gray walls, a day when the last of the snow
was starting to melt away and show lifeless patches of last year's grass in the
fields beyond the prison.
the warden has a good-sized office in the administration wing, and behind the
warden's desk there's a door which connects with the assistant warden's office..

ginning?" the warden said, probably in
his sweetest let's-all-turn-to- the-twenty-third- psalm-and-read-in-unison
voice. "that usually works the best."
and so andy did. he began by refreshing norton on the details of the crime he
had been imprisoned for. then he told the warden exactly what tommy williams had
told him. he also gave out tommy's name, which you may think wasn't so wise in
light of later developments, but i'd just ask you what else he could have done,
if his story was to have any credibility at all.
when he had finished, norton was completely silent for some time. i can just see
him, probably tipped back in his office chair under the picture of governor reed
hanging on the wall, his fingers steepled, his liver lips pursed, his brow
wrinkled into ladder rungs halfway to the crown of his head, his thirty-year pin
gleaming mellowly.
"yes," he said finally. "that's the damnedest story i ever heard. but i'll tell
you what surprises me most about it, dufresne."
"what's that, sir?"

t. not surprising he didn't realize what a state it would put

"don't you think i thought of that?" andy asked. "but i'd never told tommy about
the man working down at the marina. i never told anyone that-it never even crossed my
mind! but tommy's description of his cellmate and that man . . . they're identical!"
"well, now, you may be indulging in a little selective perception there," norton
said with a chuckle. phrases like that, selective perception, are required learning for people
in the penology and corrections business, and they use them all they can.
"that's not it at all. sir."
"that's your slant on it," norton said, "but mine differs. and let's remember that i have
only your word that there was such a man working at the falmouth hills country club
back then."
"no, sir," andy broke in again. "no, that isn't true. because-"

to get to solitary wing you were led down twenty-three steps to a basement level where
the only sound was the drip of water. the only light was supplied by a series of dangling
sixty-watt bulbs. the cells were keg-shaped, like those wall-safes rich people sometimes
hide behind a picture. like a safe, the round doorways were hinged, and solid instead of
barred. you got ventilation from above, but no light except for your own sixty-watt bulb,
which was turned off from a master-switch promptly at 8:00 p.m., an hour before lightsout
in the rest of the prison. the light bulb wasn't in a wire mesh cage or anything like
that. the feeling was that if you wanted to exist down there in the dark, you were
welcome to it. not many did . . . but after eight, of course, you had no choice. you had a
bunk bolted to the wall and a can with no toilet seat. you had thr

patiently, andy renewed his request. and renewed it. and renewed it. he had changed,
had andy dufresne. suddenly, as that spring of 1963 bloomed around us, there were lines
in his face and sprigs of gray showing in his hair. he had lost that little trace of a smile that
always seemed to linger around his mouth. his eyes stared out into space more often, and
you get to know that when a man stares that way, he is counting up the years served, the
months, the weeks, the days.

he renewed his request and renewed it. he was patient. he had nothing but time. it got to
be summer. in washington, president kennedy was promising a fresh assault on poverty
and on civil rights inequalities, not knowing he had only half a year to live. in liverpool, a

four years away from what new england folks call the miracle of '67, were languishing in
the cellar of the american league. all of those things were going on out in a larger world
where people walked free.
norton saw him near the end of june, and this conversation i heard about from andy
himself some seven years later.
"if it's the squeeze, you don't have to worry," andy told norton in a low voice. "do you
think i'd talk that up? i'd be cutting my own throat. i'd be just as indictabl

"but-"
"don't you ever mention money to me again," norton said. "not in this office, not
anywhere. not unless you want to see that library turned back into a storage room and
paint-locker again. do you understand?"
"i was trying to set your mind at ease, that's all."
"well, now, when i need a sorry son of a bitch like you to set my mind at ease, i'll retire. i
agreed to this appointment because i got tired of being pestered, dufresne. i want it to
stop. if you want to buy this particular brooklyn bridge, that's your affair. don't make it
mine. i could hear crazy stories like yours twice a week if i wanted to lay myself open to
them. every sinner in this place would be using me for a crying towel. i had more respect
for you. but this is the end. the end. have we got an understanding?"
"yes," andy said. "but i'll be hiring a lawyer, you know."

"tommy williams is no longer an inmate of this facility."

"he's been transferred."
"transferred where?"
"cashman. "
at that, andy fell silent. he was an intelligent man, but it would have taken an
extraordinarily stupid man not to smell deal all over that. cashman was a minimumsecurity
prison far up north in aroostook county. the inmates pick a lot of potatoes, and
that's hard work, but they are paid a decent wage for their labor and they can attend
classes at cvi, a pretty decent vocational-technical institute, if they so desire. more

"as a favor to you," norton said calmly, "i checked with rhode island. they did
have an inmate named elwood blatch. he was given what they call a pp-provisional
parole, another one of these crazy liberal programs to put criminals out on the
streets. he's since disappeared. "
andy said: "the warden down there . . . is he a friend of yours?"
sam norton gave andy a smile as cold as a deacon's watch chain. "we are
acquainted," he said.
"why?" andy repeated. "can't you tell me why you did it? you knew i wasn't going
to talk about . . . about anything you might have had going. you knew that. so
why?"
"because people like you make me sick," norton said deliberately. "i like you

he had told andy that andy walked around the exercise yard as if he were at a
cocktail party. that isn't the way i would have put it, but i know what he
meant. it goes back to what i said about andy wearing his freedom like an
invisible coat, about how he never really developed a prison mentality. his eyes
never got that dull look. he never developed the walk that men get when the day
is over and they are going back to their cells for another endless night-that

flat-footed, hump-shouldered walk. andy walked with his shoulders squared, and
his step was always light, as if he were heading home to a good home-cooked meal
and a good woman instead of to a tasteless mess of soggy vegetables, lumpy
mashed potato, and a slice or two of that fatty, gristly stuff most of the cons
called mystery meat . . . that, and a picture of raquel welch on the wall.

his dark mood broke around the time of the 1967 world series. that was the dream
year, the year the red sox won the pennant instead of placing ninth, as the las
vegas bookies had predicted. when it happened-when they won the american league
pennant -a kind of ebullience engulfed the whole prison. there was a goofy sort
of feeling that if the dead sox could come to life, then maybe anybody could do
it. i can't explain that feeling now, any more than an ex-beatlemaniac could
explain that madness, i suppose. but it was real. every radio in the place was
tuned to the games as the red sox pounded down the stretch. there was gloom when

passing around a football, bartering what they had to barter. others would be at
the long table in the visitors' hall, under the watchful eyes of the screws,
talking with their relatives, smoking cigarettes, telling sincere lies,
receiving their picked-over care-packages.
andy was squatting indian fashion against the wall, chunking two small rocks
together in his hands, his face turned up into the sunlight. it was surprisingly
warm, that sun, for a day so late in the year.
"hello, red," he called. "come on and sit a spell."
i did.

"millennium sandwiches" i just told you about

he shrugged and changed the subject. "big anniversary coming up for you next

i nodded. next year would make me a thirty-year man. sixty per cent of my life
spent in shawshank state prison.

"i think it always does when you know the damn winter's almost right on top of
you."
he nodded, and we were silent for awhile.
"when i get out of here," andy said finally, "i'm going where it's warm all the
time." he spoke with such calm assurance you would have thought he had only a
month or so left to serve. "you know where i'm goin, red?"
"nope. "
"zihuatanejo," he said, rolling the word softly from his tongue like music.
"down in mexico. it's a little place maybe twenty miles from playa azul and
mexico highway thirty-seven. it's a hundred miles northwest of acapulco on the

i told him i didn't.

"there are really only two types of men in the world when it comes to bad
trouble," andy said, cupping a match between his hands and lighting a cigarette.
"suppose there was a house full of rare paintings and sculptures and fine old
antiques, red? and suppose the guy who owned the house heard that there was a
monster of a hurricane headed right at it? one of those two kinds of men just

i didn't say anything for awhile. i guess i was trying to absorb the idea that
this small, spare man in prison gray next to me could be worth more money than
warden norton would make in the rest of his miserable life, even with the scams
thrown in.

last. "for that kind of dough you could have hired clarence darrow, or whoever's

i saw it. for all the good that money could do andy, it might as well have
really belonged to another person. in a way, it did. and if the stuff it was
invested in suddenly turned bad, all andy could do would be to watch the plunge,
to trace it day after day on the stocks and-bonds page of the press-herald. it's
a tough life if you don't weaken, i guess.

i suppose the most famous case of all was that of sid nedeau. this goes back to
1958, and i guess it will never be topped. sid was out lining the ball field for
a saturday intramural baseball game when the three o'clock inside whistle blew,
signaling the shift change for the guards. the parking lot is just beyond the
exercise yard, on the other side of the electrically operated main gate. at
three the gate opens and

sid just trundled his lining machine right out through the gate, leaving a
three-inch baseline all the way from home plate in the exercise yard to the
ditch on the far side of route 6, where they found the machine overturned in a
pile of lime. don't ask me how he did it. he was dressed in his prison uniform,

can figure is that, it being friday afternoon and all, the guards going off were

at are winning the
prison version of the irish sweepstakes. purely a case of six different kinds of
luck somehow jelling together all at the same moment. a stiff like andy could
wait ninety years and not get a similar break.
maybe you remember, a ways back, i mentioned a guy named henley backus, the
washroom foreman in the laundry. he came to shawshank in 1922 and died in the
prison infirmary thirty-one years later. escapes and escape attempts were a
hobby of his, maybe because he never quite dared to take the plunge himself. he
could tell you a hundred different schemes, all of them crackpot, and all of
them had been tried in the shank at one time or another. my favorite was the
tale of beaver morrison, a b&e convict who tried to build a glider from scratch
in the plate-factory basement. the plans he was working from were in a 
65
circa-1900 book called the modern boy's guide to fan and adventure. beaver got
it built without being discovered, or so the story goes, only to discover there

was no door from the basement big enough to get the damned thing out. when
henley told that story, you could bust a gut laughing, and he knew a dozen-no,
two dozen-almost as funny.
when it came to detailing shawshank bust-outs, henley had it down chapter and
verse. he told me once that during his time there had been better than four
hundred escape attempts that he knew of. really think about that for a moment
before you just nod your head and read on four hundred escape attempts! that
comes out to 12.9 escape attempts for every year henley backus was in shawshank
and keeping track of them. the escape-attempt-of-the-month club. of course most
of them were pretty slipshod affairs, the sort of thing that ends up with a
guard grabbing some poor, sidling slob's arm and growling, "where do you think
you're going, you happy asshole?"
henley said he'd class maybe sixty of them as more serious attempts, and he
included the "prison break" of 1937, the year before

 i arrived at the shank. the
new administration wing was under construction then and fourteen cons got out,
using construction equipment in a poorly locked shed. the whole of southern
maine got into a panic over those fourteen "hardened criminals," most of whom
were scared to death and had no more idea of where they should go than a
jackrabbit does when it's headlight-pinned to the highway with a big truck
bearing down on it. not one of those fourteen got away. two of them were shot
dead-by civilians, not police officers or prison personnel-but none got away.
how many had gotten away between 1938, when i came here, and that day in october
when andy first mentioned zihuatanejo to me? putting my information and henley's
together, i'd say ten. ten that got away clea

 nothing more than a cushy furlough program, but i wasn't entirely
sure. maybe a good old mississippi hard-ass lawyer could crack him . . . and
maybe that lawyer wouldn't even have to work that hard. williams had honestly
liked andy. every now and then i'd bring these points up to andy, who would only
smile, his eyes far away, and say he was thinking about it.
apparently he'd been thinking about a lot of other things, as well.
in 1975, andy dufresne escaped from shawshank. he hasn't been recaptured, and i
don't think he ever will be. in fact, i don't think andy dufresne even exists
anymore. but i think there's a man down in zihuatanejo, mexico, named peter
stevens. probably running a very new small hotel in this year of our lord 1976.
i'll tell you what i know and what i think; that's about all i can do, isn't it?
on march 12th, 1975, the cell doors in cellblock 5 opened at 6:30 a.m., as they
do every morning around here except sunday. and as they do every day except

he and burkes went up the line again, counting noses. they didn't have to go
far.
"who belongs in this cell?" gonyar asked the rightside night guard.
"andrew dufresne," the rightside answered, and that was all it took. everything
stopped being routine right then. the balloon went up.
in all the prison movies i've seen, this wailing horn goes off when there's been
a break. that never happens at shawshank. the first thing gonyar did was to get
in touch with the warden. the second thing was to get a search of the prison
going. the third was to alert the state police in scarborough to the possibility
of a breakout.
that was the routine. it didn't call for them to search the suspected es

t of us had been
locked up all of that day. had we been questioned? we had spent most of that
long day being questioned by harried screws who were feeling the breath of the
dragon on the backs of their necks. we all said the same thing: we had seen
nothing, heard nothing. and so far as i know, we were all telling the truth. i
know that i was. all we could say was that andy had indeed been in his cell at
the time of the lock-in, and at lights-out an hour later.
one wit suggested that andy had poured himself out through the keyhole. the
suggestion earned the guy four days in solitary they were uptight. so norton came down.

he stalked down glaring at us with blue eyes nearly hot enough to strike sparks from the
tempered steel bar of our cages. he looked at us as if he believed we were all in on it
probably he did believe it.
he went into andy's cell and looked around. it was just as andy had left it, the
sheets on his bunk turned back but without looking slept-in. rocks on the
windowsill

 . . . but not all of them. the ones he liked best he took with him.
"rocks," norton hissed, and swept them off the window ledge with a clatter.
gonyar, who was now on overtime, winced but said nothing .
norton's eyes fell on the linda ronstadt poster. linda was looking back over her
shoulder, her hands tucked into the back pockets of a very tight pair of
fawn-colored slacks. she was wearing a halter and she had a deep california tan.
it must have offended the hell out of norton's baptist sensibilities, that
poster.
watching him glare at it, i remembered what andy had once said about feeling he
could almost step through the picture and be with the girl.
in a very real way, that was exactly what he did, as norton was only seconds
from discovering.
"wretched thing!" he grunted, and ripped the poster from the wall with a single
swipe of his hand. and revealed t

gonyar wouldn't go in.
norton ordered him. god, they must have heard norton ordering rich gonyar to go
in there all over the prison, and gonyar just refused him, point blank.
"i'll have your job for this!" norton screamed. he was as hysterical as a woman
having a hot-flash. he had utterly blown his cool. his neck had turned a rich,
dark red, and two veins stood out, throbbing, on his forehead. "you can count on
it, you . . . you frenchman! i'll have your job and i'll see to it that you
never get another one in any prison system in new england!"
gonyar silently held out his service pistol to norton, butt first. he'd had enough. he was
then two hours overtime, going on three, and he'd just had enough. it was as if andy's
defection from our happy little family had driven norton right over the edge of some
private irrationality that h

i knew well enough what they showed him, a wall which looked, in cross-section,
like a sandwich. the entire wall was ten feet thick. the inner and outer
sections were each about four feet thick. in the center was two feet of
pipe-space, and you want to believe that was the meat of the thing . . . in more
ways than one.
tremont's voice came out of the hole, sounding hollow and dead. "something
smells awful in here, warden."
"never mind that! keep going."
tremont's lower legs disappeared into the hole. a moment later his feet were
gone, too. his light flashed dimly back and forth.
"warden, it smells pretty damn bad."
"never mind, i said!" norton cried.
dolorously, tremont's voice floated back: "smells like shit. oh god, that's what
it is, it's shit, oh my god lemme outta here i'm gonna blow my groceries oh shit

examining the hole and the rock-hammer, and he swore later that it was nearly as
big as a cocker spaniel pup. he went back up the crawlspace to andy's cell like
a monkey on a stick.
andy had gone into that pipe. maybe he knew that it emptied into a stream five
hundred yards beyond the prison on the marshy western side. i think he did. the 
72
prison blueprints were around, and andy would have found a way to look at them.
he was a methodical cuss. he would have known or found out that the sewer-pipe
running out of cellblock 5 was the last one in shawshank not hooked into the new
waste-treatment plant, and he would have known it was do it by mid- 197 5 or do
it never, because in august they were going to switch us over to the new waste treatment
plant, too. fi

crawled that distance, maybe with one of those small pen lights in his hand, maybe with
nothing but a couple of books of matches. he crawled through foulness that i either can't
imagine or don't want to imagine. maybe the rats scattered in front of him, or maybe they
went for him the way such animals sometimes will when they've had a chance to grow
bold in the dark. he must have had just enough clearance at the shoulders to keep
moving, and he probably had to shove himself through the places where the lengths of
pipe were joined. if it had been me, the claustrophobia would have driven me mad a dozen
times over. but he did it.
at the far end of the pipe they found a set of muddy footprints leading out of
the sluggish, polluted

can get the sand-mix too thick or too thin, and the same is true of the
gravel-mix. and back in 1934, the science of mixing the stuff was a lot less
sophisticated than it is today.
the walls of cellblock 5 were solid enough, but they weren't exactly dry and
toasty. as a matter or fact, they were and are pretty damned dank. after a long
wet spell they would sweat and sometimes even drip. cracks had a way of
appearing, some an inch deep. they were routinely mortared over.
now here comes andy dufresne into cellblock 5. he's a man who graduated from the
university of maine's school of business, but he's also a man who took two or
three geology courses along the e way. geology had, in fact, become his chief
hobby. i imagine it appealed to his patient, meticulous nature. a

my cell wall. not to worry, my good man."
no, he couldn't have that. so he came to me and asked if i could get him a rita
hayworth poster. not a little one but a big one.
and, of course, he had the rock-hammer. i remember thinking when i got him that
gadget back in '48 that it would take a man six hundred years to burrow through
the wall with it. true enough. but andy only had to go through half the wall-and
even with the soft concrete, it took him two rock-hammers and twenty-seven years
to do it.
of course he lost most of one of those years to normaden, and he could only work
at night, preferably late at night, when almost everybody is asleep-including
the guards who work the night shift. but i suspect the thing which slowed him 
76
down the most was getting rid of the wall as he took it out. h

e could muffle the
sound of his work by wrapping the head of his hammer in rock-polishing cloths,
but what to do with the pulverized concrete and the occasional chunks that came
out whole?
i think he must have broken up the chunks into pebbles and . . .
i remembered the sunday after i had gotten him the rockhammer. i remember
watching him walk across the exercise yard, his face puffy from his latest
go-round with the sisters. i saw him stoop, pick up a pebble . . . and it
disappeared up his sleeve. that inside sleeve-pocket is an old prison trick. up
your sleeve or just inside the cuff of your pants. and i have another memory,
very strong but unfocused, maybe something i saw more than once. this memory is
of andy dufresne walking across the exercise yard on a hot summer day when the
air was utterly still. still, yeah . . . except for the little breeze that
seemed to be blowing sand around andy dufresne's feet. so maybe he had a couple
of cheaters in his pants below the knee

 any real plans or hopes of breaking out, at least not at
first. he probably assumed the wall was ten feet of solid concrete, and that if
he succeeded in boring all the way through it, he'd come out thirty feet over
the exercise yard. but like i say, i don't think he was worried overmuch about
breaking through. his assumption could have run this way: i m only making a foot
of progress every seven years or so; therefore, it would take me seventy years
to break through; that would make me one hundred and one years old.
here's a second assumption i would have made, had i been andy: that eventually i
would be caught and get a lot of solitary time, not to mention a very large
black mark on my record. after all, there was the regular weekly inspection and
a surprise toss-which usually came at night-every second week or so. he must
have decided that things couldn't go on for long. sooner or later, some screw
was going to peek behind rita hayworth just to make sure andy didn't have a

huatanejo for the first time. all of a sudden, instead of just being a toy,
that stupid hole in the wall became his master-if he knew about the sewer-pipe
at the bottom and that it led under the outer wall, it did, anyway.
he'd had the key under the rock in buxton to worry about for years. now he had d
worry that some eager-beaver new guard would look behind his poster and expose
the whole thing, or that he would get another cellmate, or that he would, after
all those years, suddenly be transferred he had all those things on his mind for
the next eight years. all scan say is that he must have been one of the coolest
men who ever lived. i would have gone completely nuts after awhile, living with
al that uncertainty. but andy just went on playing the game.
he had to carry tie possibility of discovery for another eight years-the
probability )f it, you might say, because no matter how carefully he stacked tie
cards in his favor, as an inmate of a state prison, he just didn't have that

 stack . . . and the gods had been kind to him for a very long time; some
nineteen years.
the most ghastly irony i can think of would have been if he had been offered a
parole. can you imagine it? three days before the parolee is actually released,
he is transferred into the light security wing to undergo a complete physical
and a battery of vocational tests. while he's there, his old cell is completely
cleaned out. instead of getting his parole, andy would have gotten a long turn
downstairs in solitary, followed by some more time upstairs . . . but in a
different cell.
if he broke into the shaft in 1967, how come he didn't escape until 1975 ? i
don't know for sure-but i can advance some pretty good guesses.
first, he would have become more careful than ev

i'd guess that, by the time nixon was sworn in for his second
term, the hole would have been wide enough for him to wriggle through . . . and
probably sooner than that. andy was a small guy.
why didn't he go then?
that's where my educated guesses run out, folks; from this point they become
progressively wilder. one possibility is that the crawlspace itself was clogged
with crap and he had to clear it out. but that wouldn't account for all the
time. so what was it?
i think that maybe andy got scared.
i've told you as well as i can how it is to be an institutional man. at first
you can't stand those four walls, then you get so you can abide them, then you
get so you accept them . . . and then, as your body and your mind and your
spirit adjust to life on an ho scale, you get to love them. you are told when to
eat, when you can write letters, when you can smoke. if you're at work in the
laundry or the plate-shop, you're assigned five minutes of each hour when you
can go to the bathroom. for t

 ever get? the blueprints
might have told him how big the pipe's bore was, but a blueprint couldn't tell
him what it would be like inside that pipe-if he would be able to breathe
without choking, if the rats were big enough and mean enough to fight instead of

retreating . . . and a blueprint couldn't've told him what he'd find at the end
of the pipe, when and if he got there. here's a joke even funnier than the
parole would have been: andy breaks into the sewer line, crawls through five
hundred yards of choking, shit-smelling darkness, and comes up against a
heavy-gauge mesh screen at the end of it all. ha, ha, very funny.
that would have been on his mind. and if the long shot actually came in and he
was able to get out, would he be able to get some civilian clothes and get away
from the vicinity of the prison undetected? last of all, suppose he got out of
the pipe, got away from shawshank before the alarm was raised, got to buxton,
overturned the right rock. . . and found nothing ben

so that's my story, jack. i never believed how long it would take to write it
all down, or how many pages it would take. i started writing just after i got
that postcard, and here i am finishing up on january 14th, 1976. i've used three
pencils right down to knuckle-stubs, and a whole tablet of paper. i've kept the

saying. you were writing about andy dufresne. you're nothing but a minor
character in your own story. but you know, that's just not so. it's all about

there are others here like me, others who remember andy. we're glad he's gone,

feathers are too bright, their songs too sweet and wild. so you let them go, or
when you open the cage to feed them they somehow fly out past you. and the part

up the river-mud) made me feel a little sad and even older than i am. thank you
for listening. and andy, if you're really down there, as i believe you are, look

i never expected to take up this narrative again, but here i am with the
dog-eared, folded pages open on the desk in front of me. here i am adding
another three or four pages, writing in a brand-new tablet. a tablet i bought in
a store-i just walked into a store on portland's congress street and bought it.
i thought i had put finish to my story in a shawshank prison cell on a bleak
january day in 1976. now it's may of 1977 and i am sitting in a small, cheap
room of the brewster hotel in portland, adding to it.

outgoing parolees almost as carefully as they search incoming "new fish." and
beyond containing enough dynamite to assure me of a quick turnaround and another
six or eight years inside, my "memoirs" contained something else: the name of
the town where i believe andy dufresne to be. mexican police gladly cooperate
with the american police, and i didn't want my freedom-or my unwillingness to
give up the story i'd worked so long and hard to write-to cost andy his.
then i remembered how andy had brought in his five hundred dollars back in 1948,
and i took out my story of him the same way. just to be on the safe side, i
carefully rewrote each page which mentioned zihuatanejo. if the papers had been
found during my "outside search," as they call it at the shank, i would have
gone back in on turnaround . . . but the cops would have been looking for andy
in a peruvian seacoast town named las intrudres.

that's what a whole life in prison does for you, young man. it turns everyone in
a position of authority into a master, and you into every master's dog. maybe
you know you've become a dog, even in prison, but since everyone else in gray is
a dog, too, it doesn't seem to matter so much. outside, it does. but i couldn't
tell a young guy like him. he would never understand. neither would my po, a
big, bluff ex-navy man with a huge red beard and a large stock of polish jokes.
he saw me for about five minutes every week. "are you staying out of the bars,
red?" he'd ask when he'd run out of polish jokes. i'd say yeah, and that would
be the end of it until next week.

there's a big hay field in buxton, andy had said, and at the north end of that
hayfield there's a rock wall, right oat of a robert frost poem. and somewhere
along the base of that wall is a rock that has no earthly business in a maine
hayfield.
a fool's errand, you say. how many hayfields are there in a small rural town
like buxton? fifty? a hundred? speaking from personal experience, i'd put it at
even higher than that, if you add in the fields now cultivated which might have
been haygrass when andy went in. and if i did find the right one, i might never
know it. because i might overlook that black piece of volcanic glass, or, much
more likely, andy put it into his pocket and took it with him.
so i'd agree with you. a fool's errand, no doubt about it. worse, a dangerous
one for a man on parole, because some of those fields were clearly ma

i had to look at what was underneath for a long time. my eyes saw it, but it
took awhile for my mind to catch up. it was an envelope, carefully wrapped in a
plastic bag to keep away the damp. my name was written across the front in
andy's clear script.
i took the envelope and left the rock where andy had left it, and andy's friend
