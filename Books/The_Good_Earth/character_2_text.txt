of hills and bamboo. but the rain
of generations had poured upon this painting until now
there was only a faint feathery shadow of bamboos left,
and the hills were almost wholly gone.

within the temple, snugly under the roof, sat two small,
solemn figures, earthen, for they were formed from the
earth of the fields about the temple. these were the god
himself and his lady. they wore robes of red and gilt
paper, and the god had a scant, drooping moustache of
real hair. each year at the new year, wang lung's father
bought sheets of red paper and carefully cut and pasted
new robes for the pair. and each year rain and snow beat
in and the sun of summer shone in and spoiled their robes.

at this moment, however, the robes were still new,
since the year was but well begun, and wang lung was
proud of their spruce appearance. he took the basket
from the woman's arm and carefully he looked about under
the pork for the sticks of incense he had bought. he was
anxious lest they were broken and thus make an evil

become the trouble that from the beginning wang lung
had surmised he might become. this uncle was the younger
brother of wang lung's father, and by all the claims of
relationship he might depend upon wang lung if he had
not enough for himself and his family. so long as wang
lung and his father were poor and scantily fed the uncle
made muster to scratch about on his land and gather
enough to feed his seven children and his wife and himself.
but once fed none of them worked. the wife would not
stir herself to sweep the floor of their hut, nor did the
children trouble to wash the food from their faces. it was

room where o-lan had died and he took his possessions
and moved altogether into the inner court where lotus

so the two moved into it and were content.

then as though death could not easily leave the house
where it had come once, the old man, wang lung's father,
who had been distraught ever since he saw them putting

his bed one night for sleeping, and when the second daugh-
ter came in to him in the morning to bring him his tea,
there he lay on his bed, his scattered old beard thrust up
into the air, and his head thrown back in death.

she cried out at the sight and ran crying to her father,
and wang lung came in and found the old man so; his
light, stiff old body was dry and cold and thin as a
