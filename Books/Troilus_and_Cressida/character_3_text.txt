 she belov'd knows nought that knows not this:

    that she was never yet that ever knew
    love got so sweet as when desire did sue;
    therefore this maxim out of love i teach:
    achievement is command; ungain'd, beseech.

  agamemnon. princes,
    what grief hath set these jaundies o'er your cheeks?
    the ample proposition that hope makes
    in all designs begun on earth below
    fails in the promis'd largeness; checks and disasters
    grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,
    as knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,
    infects the sound pine, and diverts his grain
    tortive and errant from his course of growth.
    nor, princes, is it matter new to us

    or made a toast for neptune. even so
    doth valour's show and valour's worth divide
    in storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness
    the herd hath more annoyance by the breeze
    than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind
    makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,
    and flies fled under shade-why, then the thing of courage
    as rous'd with rage, with rage doth sympathise,
    and with an accent tun'd in self-same key
    retorts to chiding fortune.
  ulysses. agamemnon,
    thou great commander, nerve and bone of greece,
    heart of our numbers, soul and only spirit
    in whom the tempers and the minds of all
    should be shut up-hear what ulysses speaks.
    besides the applause and approbation
    the which, [to agamemnon] most mighty, for thy place and sway,
    [to nestor] and, thou most reverend, for thy stretch'd-out life,
    i give to both your speeches- which were such
    as agamemnon and the hand of greece
    should hold up

    should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree
    on which heaven rides, knit all the greekish ears
    to his experienc'd tongue-yet let it please both,
    thou great, and wise, to hear ulysses speak.
  agamemnon. speak, prince of ithaca; and be't of less expect
    that matter needless, of importless burden,
    divide thy lips than we are confident,
    when rank thersites opes his mastic jaws,
    we shall hear music, wit, and oracle.
  ulysses. troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,
    and the great hector's sword had lack'd a master,
    but for these instances:
    the specialty of rule hath been neglected;
    and look how many grecian tents do stand
    hollow up

    exampl'd by the first pace that is sick

    of pale and bloodless emulation.

    troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.
  nestor. most wisely hath ulysses here discover'd
    the fever whereof all our power is sick.
  agamemnon. the nature of the sickness found, ulysses,
    what is the remedy?
  ulysses. the great achilles, whom opinion crowns
    the sinew and the forehand of our host,
    having his ear full of his airy fame,
    grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent
    lies mocking our designs; with him patroclus

    sir valour dies; cries 'o, enough, patroclus;
    or give me ribs of steel! i shall split all
    in pleasure of my spleen.' and in this fashion
    all our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,
    severals and generals of grace exact,
    achievements, plots, orders, preventions,
    excitements to the field or speech for truce,
    success or loss, what is or is not, serves
    as stuff for these two to make paradoxes.
  nestor. and in the imitation of these twain-
    who, as ulysses says, opinion crowns
    with an imperial voice-many are infect.
    ajax is grown self-will'd and bears his head
    in such a rein, in full as proud a place
    as broad achilles; keeps his tent like him;
    makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war
    bold as an oracle, and sets thersites,
    a slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
    to match us in comparisons with dirt,
    to weaken and discredit our exposure,
    how rank soever rounded in with danger.

    to answer for his love, tell him from me
    i'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver,
    and in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,

  nestor. what is't?
  ulysses. this 'tis:
    blunt wedges rive hard knots. the seeded pride
    that hath to this maturity blown up
    in rank achilles must or now be cropp'd
    or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil
    to overbulk us all.
  nestor. well, and how?
  ulysses. this challenge that the gallant hector sends,
    however it is spread in general name,
    relates in purpose only to achilles.
  nestor. true. the purpose is perspicuous even as substance
    whose grossness little characters sum up;
    and, in the publication, make no strain
    but that achilles, were his brain as barren
    as banks of libya-though, apollo knows,
    'tis dry enough-will with great speed of judgment,

    that can from hector bring those honours off,
    if not achilles? though 't be a sportful combat,
    yet in this trial much opinion dwells;
    for here the troyans taste our dear'st repute
    with their fin'st palate; and trust to me, ulysses,
    our imputation shall be oddly pois'd
    in this vile action; for the success,
    although particular, shall give a scantling
    of good or bad unto the general;
    and in such indexes, although small pricks
    to their subsequent volumes, there is seen
    the baby figure of the giant mas

    therefore 'tis meet achilles meet not hector.

strange, ulysses.
    the beauty that is borne here in the face
    the bearer knows not, but commends itself

    that most pure spirit of sense-behold itself,
    not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed
    salutes each other with each other's form;
    for speculation turns not to itself
    till it hath travell'd, and is mirror'd there

    they clap the lubber ajax on the shoulder,
    as if his foot were on brave hector's breast,
    and great troy shrinking.
  achilles. i do believe it; for they pass'd by me
    as misers do by beggars-neither gave to me

  ulysses. time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,
    wherein he puts alms for oblivion,
    a great-siz'd monster of ingratitudes.
    those scraps are good deeds past, which are devour'd
    as fast as they are made, forgot as soon
    as done. perseverance, dear my lord,
    keeps honour bright. to have done is to hang
    quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail

    before the belching whale; then is he yonder,
    and there the strawy greeks, ripe for his edge,
    fall down before him like the mower's swath.
    here, there, and everywhere, he leaves and takes;
    dexterity so obeying appetite
    that what he will he does, and does so much
    that proof is call'd impossibility.

                       enter ulysses

  ulysses. o, courage, courage, courage, princes! great
    achilles is arming, weeping, cursing, vowing vengeance.
    patroclus' wounds have rous'd his drowsy blood,
    together with his mangled myrmidons,
    that noseless, handless, hack'd and chipp'd, come to
    him, crying on hector. ajax hath lost a friend
    and foams at mouth, and he is arm'd and at it,
    roaring for troilus; who hath done to-day
    mad and fantastic execution,
    engaging and redeeming of himself
