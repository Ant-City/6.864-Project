'boromir is dead,' said aragorn. 'i am unscathed, for i was not here with him. he fell defending the hobbits, while i was away upon the hill.'
'the hobbits!' cried gimli 'where are they then? where is frodo?'
'i do not know,' answered aragorn wearily. 'before he died boromir told me that the orcs had bound them; he did not think that they were dead. i sent him to follow merry and pippin; but i did not ask him if frodo or sam were with him: not until it was too late. all that i have done today has gone amiss. what is to be done now?'
'first we must tend the fallen,' said legolas. 'we cannot leave him lying like carrion among these foul orcs.'
'but we must be swift,' said gimli. 'he would not wish us to linger. we must follow the orcs, if there is hope that any of our company are living prisoners.'
'but we do not know whether the ring-bearer is with them or not ' said

'not idly do the leaves of lórien fall,' said aragorn. 'this did not drop by chance: it was cast away as a token to any that might follow. i think pippin ran away from the trail for that purpose.'
'then he at least was alive,' said gimli. 'and he had the use of his wits, and of his legs too. that is heartening. we do not pursue in vain.'
'let us hope that he did not pay too dearly for his boldness,' said legolas. 'come! let us go on! the thought of those merry young folk driven like cattle burns my heart.'
the sun climbed to the noon and then rode slowly down the sky. light clouds came up out of the sea in the distant south and were blown away upon the breeze. the sun sank. shadows rose behind and reached out long arms from the east. still the hunters held on. one day now had passed since boromir fell, and the orcs were yet far ahead. no longer could any sight of them be seen in the level plains.
as nightshade was closing about them aragorn halted. o

aragorn and his companions searched far and wide about the field of battle, but the light faded, and evening soon drew down, dim and misty. by nightfall they had discovered no trace of merry and pippin.
'we can do no more,' said gimli sadly. 'we have been set many riddles since we came to tol brandir, but this is the hardest to unravel. i would guess that the burned bones of the hobbits are now mingled with the orcs'. it will be hard news for frodo, if he lives to hear it; and hard too for the old hobbit who waits in rivendell. elrond was against their coming.'

'but gandalf chose to come himself, and he was the first to be lost ' answered gimli.

chapter 3

the uruk-hai

pippin lay in a dark and troubled dream: it seemed that he could hear his own small voice echoing in black tunnels, calling frodo, frodo! but instead of frodo hundreds of hideous orc-faces grinned at him out of the shadows, hundreds of hideous arms grasped at him from every side. where was merry?
he woke. cold air blew on his face. he was lying on his back. evening was coming and the sky above was growing dim. he turned and found that the dream was little worse than the waking. his wrists, legs, and ankles were tied with cords. beside him merry lay, white-faced, with a dirty rag bound across his brows. all about them sat or stood a great company of orcs.
slowly in pippin's aching head memory pieced itself together and became separated from dream-shadows. of course: he and merry had run

 off into the woods. what had come over them? why had they dashed off like that, taking no notice of old strider? they had run a long way shouting--he could not remember how far or how long; and then suddenly they had crashed right into a group of orcs: they were standing listening, and they did not appear to see merry and pippin until they were almost in their arms. then they yelled and dozens of other goblins had sprung out of the trees. merry and he had drawn their swords, but the orcs did not wish to fight, and had tried only to lay hold of them, even when merry had cut off several of their arms and hands. good old merry!
then boromir had come leaping through the trees. he had made them fight. he slew many of them and the rest fled. but they had not gone far on the way back when they were attacked again. by a hundred orcs at least, some of them very large, and they shot a rain of arrows: always at boromir. boromir had blown his gre

at horn till the woods rang, and at first the orcs had been dismayed and had drawn back; but when no answer but the echoes came, they had attacked more fierce than ever. pippin did not remember much more. his last memo was of boromir leaning against a tree, plucking out an arrow; then darkness fell suddenly.
'i suppose i was knocked on the head,' he said to himself. 'i wonder if poor merry is much hurt. what has happened to boromir? why didn't the orcs kill us? where are we, and where are we going?'
he could not answer the questions. he felt cold and sick. 'i wish gandalf had never persuaded elrond to let us come,' he thought. 'what good have i been? just a nuisance: a passenger, a piece of luggage. and now i have been stolen and i am just a piece of luggage for the orcs. i hope strider or someone will come and claim us! but ought i to hope for it? won't that throw out all the pl

t to the ground. round them were many smaller goblins. pippin supposed that these were the ones from the north. they had drawn their knives and swords, but hesitated to attack uglúk.
uglúk shouted, and a number of other orcs of nearly his own size ran up. then suddenly, without warning, uglúk sprang forwards, and with two swift strokes swept the heads off two of his opponents. grishnákh stepped aside and vanished into the shadows. the others gave way, and one stepped backwards and fell over merry's prostrate form with a curse. yet that probably saved his life, for uglúk's followers leaped over him and cut down another with their broad-bladed swords. it was the yellow-fanged guard. his body fell right on top of pippin, still clutching its long saw-edged knife.
'put up your weapons!' shouted uglúk. 'and let's have no more nonsense! we go straight west from here, and down the stair. from there straight to the downs, then along the river to the forest. and we march day and night. that cle

quickly pippin took it in his fingers and knotted it again into a loose bracelet of two loops and slipped it over his hands. then he lay very still.
'pick up those prisoners!' shouted uglúk. 'don't play any tricks with them! if they are not alive when we get back, someone else will die too.'
an orc seized pippin like a sack. put its head between his tied hands, grabbed his arms and dragged them down, until pippin's face was crushed against its neck; then it jolted off with him. another treated merry in the same way. the orc's clawlike hand gripped pippin's arms like iron; the nails bit into him. he shut his eyes and slipped back into evil dreams.
suddenly he was thrown on to the stony floor again. it was early night, but the slim moon was already falling westward. they were on the edge of a cliff that seemed to look out over a sea of pale mist. there was a sound of water falling nearby.
'the scouts have come back at last,' said an orc close at hand.

he cut the thongs round pippin's legs and ankles, picked him up by his hair and stood him on his feet. pippin fell down, and uglúk dragged him up by his hair again. several orcs laughed. uglúk thrust a flask between his teeth and poured some burning liquid down his throat: he felt a hot fierce glow flow through him. the pain in his legs and ankles vanished. he could stand.
'now for the other!' said uglúk. pippin saw him go to merry, who was lying close by, and kick him. merry groaned. seizing him roughly uglúk pulled him into a sitting position, and tore the bandage off his head. then he smeared the wound with some dark stuff out of a small wooden box. merry cried out and struggled wildly.
the orcs clapped and hooted. 'can't take his medicine,' they jeered. 'doesn't know what's good for him. ai! we shall have some fun later.'
but at the moment uglúk was not engaged in sport. he needed speed and had to humour unwilling f

ollowers. he was healing merry in orc-fashion; and his treatment worked swiftly. when he had forced a drink from his flask down the hobbit's throat, cut his leg-bonds, and dragged him to his feet, merry stood up, looking pale but grim and defiant, and very much alive. the gash in his forehead gave him no more trouble, but he bore a brown scar to the end of his days.
'hullo, pippin!' he said. 'so you've come on this little expedition, too? where do we get bed and breakfast?'
'now then!' said uglúk. 'none of that! hold your tongues. no talk to one another. any trouble will be reported at the other end, and he'll know how to pay you. you'll get bed and breakfast all right: more than you can stom

ach.'
the orc-band began to descend a narrow ravine leading down into the misty plain below. merry and pippin, separated by a dozen orcs or more, climbed down with them. at the bottom they stepped on to grass, and the hearts of the hobbits rose.
'now straight on!' shouted uglúk. 'west and a little north. follow lugdush.'
'but what are we going to do at sunrise?' said some of the northerners.
'go on running,' said uglúk. 'what do you think? sit on the grass and wait for the whiteskins to join the picnic?'
'but we can't run in the sunlight.'
'you'll run with me behind you,' said uglúk. 'run

 of three. pippin was far back in the line. he wondered how long he would be able to go on at this pace: he had had no food since the morning. one of his guards had a whip. but at present the orc-liquor was still hot in him. his wits, too, were wide-awake.
every now and again there came into his mind unbidden a vision of the keen face of strider bending over a dark trail, and running, running behind. but what could even a ranger see except a confused trail of orc-feet? his own little prints and merry's were overwhelmed by the trampling of the iron-shod shoes before them and behind them and about them.
they had gone only a mile or so from the cliff when the land sloped down into a wide shallow depression, where the ground was soft and wet. mist lay there, pale-glimmering in the last rays of the sickle moon. the dark shapes of the orcs in front grew dim, and then were swallowed up.
'ai! steady now!' shouted uglúk from the rear.
a sudden thought leaped into pippin's mind, and he acted on it a

a whip-thong curled round his legs, and he stifled a cry.
'enough!' shouted uglúk running up. 'he's still got to run a long way yet. make 'em both run! just use the whip as a reminder.'
'but that's not all,' he snarled, turning to pippin. 'i shan't forget. payment is only put off. leg it!'
neither pippin nor merry remembered much of the later part of the journey. evil dreams and evil waking were blended into a long tunnel of misery, with hope growing ever fainter behind. they ran, and they ran, striving to keep up the pace set by the orcs, licked every now and again with a cruel thong cunningly handled. if they halted or stumbled, they were seized and dragged for some distance.
the warmth of the orc-draught had gone. pippin felt cold and sick again. suddenly he fell face downward on the turf. hard hands

. orders were shouted and he was thrown roughly on the grass.
there he lay for a while, fighting with despair. his head swam, but from the heat in his body he guessed that he had been given another draught. an orc stooped over him, and flung him some bread and a strip of raw dried flesh. he ate the stale grey bread hungrily, but not the meat. he was famished but not yet so famished as to eat flesh flung to him by an orc, the flesh of he dared not guess what creature.
he sat up and looked about. merry was not far away. they were by the banks of a swift narrow river. ahead mountains loomed: a tall peak was catching the first rays of the sun. a dark smudge of forest lay on the lower slopes before them.
there was much shouting and debating among the orcs; a quarrel seemed on the point of breaking out again between the northerners and the isengarders. some were pointing back away south, and some were pointing eastward.
'very well,' said uglúk. 'leave them to me then! no killing, as i've told yo

too soon. they're for the war-and other purposes.'
'you seem to know a lot,' said uglúk. 'more than is good for you, i guess. perhaps those in lugbúrz might wonder how, and why. but in the meantime the uruk-hai of isengard can do the dirty work, as usual. don't stand slavering there! get your rabble together! the other swine are legging it to the forest. you'd better follow. you wouldn't get back to the great river alive. right off the mark! now! i'll be on your heels.'
the isengarders seized merry and pippin again and slung them on their backs. then the troop started off. hour after hour they ran, pausing now and again only to sling the hobbits to fresh carriers. either because they were quicker and hardier, or because of some plan of grishnákh's, the isengarders gradually passed through the orcs of mordor, and grishnákh's folk closed in behind. soon they were gaining also on the northerners ahead. the forest began to draw nearer.
pippin was bruised and torn, his aching head was grated

and he had never reckoned with being cut off from gandalf, or from strider, and even from frodo. all that he could remember about rohan was that gandalf's horse, shadowfax, had come from that land. that sounded hopeful, as far as it went.
'but how will they know that we are not orcs?' he thought. 'i don't suppose they've ever heard of hobbits down here. i suppose i ought to be glad that the beastly orcs look like being destroyed, but i would rather be saved myself.' the chances were that he and merry would be killed together with their captors, before ever the men of rohan were aware of them.
a few of the riders appeared to be bowmen, skilled at shooting from a running horse. riding swiftly into range they shot arrows at the orcs that straggled behind, and several of them fell; then the riders wheeled away out of the range of the answering bows of their enemies, who shot wildly, not daring to halt. this happened many times, and on one occasion arrows fell among the isengarders. one of them,

leadership! i hope the great uglúk will lead us out again.'
'put those halflings down!' ordered uglúk, taking no notice of grishnákh. 'you, lugdush, get two others and stand guard over them! they're not to be killed, unless the filthy whiteskins break through. understand? as long as i'm alive, i want 'em. but they're not to cry out, and they're not to be rescued. bind their legs!'
the last part of the order was carried out mercilessly. but pippin found that for the first time he was close to merry. the orcs were making a great deal of noise, shouting and clashing their weapons, and the hobbits managed to whisper together for a while.
'i don't think much of this,' said merry. 'i feel nearly done in. don't think i could crawl away far, even if i was free.'
'lembas!' whispered pippin. 'lembas: i've got some. have you? i don't think they've taken anything but our swords.'
'yes, i had a packet in my pocket,' answered merry, 'but it must be battered to crumbs. anyway i can't put my mouth in my

into thick cloud, and pippin could not see anything a few feet away. the fires brought no light to the hillock. the riders were not, however, content merely to wait for the dawn and let their enemies rest. a sudden outcry on the east side of the knoll showed that something was wrong. it seemed that some of the men had ridden in close, slipped off their horses, crawled to the edge of the camp and killed several orcs, and then had faded away again. uglúk dashed off to stop a stampede.
pippin and merry sat up. their guards, isengarders, had gone with uglúk. but if the hobbits had any thought of escape, it was soon dashed. a long hairy arm took each of them by the neck and drew them close together. dimly they were aware of grishnákh's great head and hideous face between them; his foul breath was on their cheeks. he began to paw them and feel them. pippin shuddered as hard cold fingers groped down his back.
'well, my little ones!' said grishnákh in a soft whisper. 'enjoying your nice rest? o

ay,' he whispered. 'it isn't easy to find.'
'find it?' said grishnákh: his fingers stopped crawling and gripped pippin's shoulder. 'find what? what are you talking about, little one?'. for a moment pippin was silent. then suddenly in the darkness he made a noise in his throat: gollum, gollum. 'nothing, my precious,' he added.
the hobbits felt grishnákh's fingers twitch. 'o ho!' hissed the goblin softly. 'that's what he means, is it? o ho! very ve-ry dangerous, my little ones.'
'perhaps,' said merry, now alert and aware of pippin's guess. 'perhaps; and not only for us. still you know your own business best. do you want it, or not? and what would you give for it?'
'do i want it? do i want it?' said grishnákh, as if puzzled; but his arms were trembling. 'what would i give for it? what do you mean?'
'we mean,' said pippin, choosing his words carefully, 'that it's no good groping in the dark. we could save you time and trouble. but you must untie our legs first, or we'll do nothing, and say n

y dear tender little fools,' hissed grishnákh, 'everything you have, and everything you know, will be got out of you in due time: everything! you'll wish there was more that you could tell to satisfy the questioner, indeed you will: quite soon. we shan't hurry the enquiry. oh dear no! what do you think you've been kept alive for? my dear little fellows, please believe me when i say that it was not out of kindness: that's not even one of uglúk's faults.'
'i find it quite easy to believe,' said merry. 'but you haven't got your prey home yet. and it doesn't seem to be going your way, whatever happens. if we come to isengard, it won't be the great grishnákh that benefits: saruman will take all that he can find. if you want anything for yourself, now's the time to do a deal.'
grishnákh began to lose his temper. the name of saruman seemed specially to enrage him. time was passing and the disturbance was dying down. uglúk or the isengarders might return at any minute.
'have you got it - eithe

r of you?' he snarled.
'gollum, gollum!' said pippin.
'untie our legs!' said merry.
they felt the orc's arms trembling violently. 'curse you, you filthy little vermin!' he hissed. 'untie your legs? i'll untie every string in your bodies. do you think i can't search you to the bones? search you! i'll cut you both to quivering shreds. i don't need the help of your legs to get you away-and have you all to myself!'
suddenly he seized them. the strength in his long arms and shoulders was terrifying. he tucked them one under each armpit, and crushed them fiercely to his sides; a gr

d up and ran, he was ridden down and a spear passed through him. he gave a hideous shivering cry and lay still.
the hobbits remained flat on the ground, as grishnákh had left them. another horseman came riding swiftly to his comrade's aid. whether because of some special keenness of sight, or because of some other sense, the horse lifted and sprang lightly over them; but its rider did not see them, lying covered in their elven-cloaks, too crushed for the moment, and too afraid to move.
at last merry stirred and whispered softly: 'so far so good: but how are we to avoid being spitted?'
the answer came almost immediately. the cries of grishnákh had roused the orcs. from the yells and screeches that came from the knoll the hobbits guessed that their disappearance had been discovered: uglúk was probably knocking off a few more heads. then suddenly the answering cries of orc-voices came from the right, outside the circle of watch-fires, from the direction of the forest and the mountains. mauh

úr had apparently arrived and was attacking the besiegers. there was the sound of galloping horses. the riders were drawing in their ring close round the knoll, risking the orc-arrows, so as to prevent any sortie, while a company rode off to deal with the newcomers. suddenly merry and pippin realized that without moving they were now outside the circle: there was nothing between them and escape.
'now,' said merry, 'if only we had our legs and hands free, we might get away. but i can't touch the knots, and i can't bite them.'
'no need to try,' said pippin. 'i was going to tell you: i've managed to free my hands. these loops are only left for show. you'd better have a bit of lembas first.'
he slipped the cords off his wrists, and fished out a packet. the cakes were broken, but good, still in their leaf-wrappings. the hobbits each ate two or three pieces. the taste brought back to them the memory of fair f

riders had returned to their silent ominous vigil. it would not last very much longer. already the night was old. in the east, which had remained unclouded, the sky was beginning to grow pale.
'we must get under cover,' said pippin, 'or we shall be seen. it will not be any comfort to us, if these riders discover that we are not orcs after we are dead.' he got up and stamped his feet. 'those cords have cut me like wires; but my feet are getting warm again. i could stagger on now. what about you, merry?'
merry got up. 'yes,' he said, 'i can manage it. lembas does put heart into you! a more wholesome sort of feeling, too, than the heat of that orc-draught. i wonder what it was made of. better not to know, i expect. let's get a drink of water to wash away the thought of it!'
'not here, the banks are too steep,' said pippin. 'forward now!'
they turned and walked side by side slowly along the line of the river. behind them the light grew in the east. as they walked they compared notes, talking li

'you seem to have been doing well, master took,' said merry. 'you will get almost a chapter in old bilbo's book, if ever i get a chance to report to him. good work: especially guessing that hairy villain's little game, and playing up to him. but i wonder if anyone will ever pick up your trail and find that brooch. i should hate to lose mine, but i am afraid yours is gone for good.

even as he spoke the dark edge of the forest loomed up straight before them. night seemed to have taken refuge under its great trees, creeping away from the coming dawn.
'lead on, master brandybuck!' said pippin. 'or lead back! we have been warned against fangorn. but one so knowing will not have forgotten that.'
'i have not,' answered merry; 'but the forest seems better to me, all the same, than turning back into the middle of a battle.'
he led the way in under the huge branches of the trees. old beyond guessing, they seemed. great trailing beards of lichen hung from them, blowing and swaying in the breeze. out of the shadows the hobbits peeped, gazing back down the slope: little furtive figures that in the dim light looked like elf-children in the deeps of time peering out of the wild wood in wonder at their first dawn.

the great river, and the brown lands, leagues upon grey leagues away, the dawn came, red as flame. loud rang the hunting-horns to greet it. the riders of rohan sprang suddenly to life. horn answered horn again.
merry and pippin heard, clear in the cold air, the neighing of war-horses, and the sudden singing of many men. the sun's limb was lifted, an arc of fire, above the margin of the world. then with a great cry the riders charged from the east; the red light gleamed on mail and spear. the orcs yelled and shot all the arrows that remained to them. the hobbits saw several horsemen fall; but their line held on up the hill and over it, and wheeled round and charged again. most of the raiders that were left a

live then broke and fled, this way and that, pursued one by one to the death. but one band, holding together in a black wedge, drove forward resolutely in the direction of the forest. straight up the slope they charged towards the watchers. now they were drawing near, and it seemed certain that they would escape: they had already hewn down three riders that barred their way.
'we have watched too long,' said merry. 'there's uglúk! i don't want to meet him again.' the hobbits turned and fled deep into the shadows of the wood.
so it was that they did not sec the last stand, when uglúk was overtaken and brought to bay at the very edge of fangorn. there he was slain at last by éomer, the third marshal of the mark, who dismounted and fought him sword to sword. and over the wide fields the keen-eyed riders hunted down the few orcs that had escaped and still had strength to fly.

meanwhile the hobbits went with as much speed as the dark and tangled forest allowed, following the line of the running stream, westward and up towards the slopes of the mountains, deeper and deeper into fangorn. slowly their fear of the orcs died away, and their pace slackened. a queer stifling feeling came over them, as if the air were too thin or too scanty for breathing.
at last merry halted. 'we can't go on like this,' he panted. 'i want some air.'
'let's have a drink at any rate,' said pippin. 'i'm parched.' he clambered on to a great tree-root that wound down into the stream, and stooping drew up some water in his cupped hands. it was clear and cold, and he took many draughts. merry followed him. the water refreshed them and seemed to cheer their hearts; for a while they sat together on the brink of the stream, dabbling their sore feet and legs, and peering round at the t

rees that stood silently about them, rank upon rank, until they faded away into grey twilight in every direction.
'i suppose you haven't lost us already?' said pippin, leaning back against a great tree-trunk. 'we can at least follow the course of this stream, the entwash or whatever you call it, and get out again the way we came.'
'we could, if our legs would do it,' said merry; 'and if we could breathe properly.'
'yes, it is all very dim, and stuffy, in here,' said pippin. 'it reminds me, somehow, of the old room in the great place of the tooks away back in the smials at tuckborough: a huge place, where the furniture has never been moved or changed for generations. they say the old took lived in it year after year, while he and the room got older and shabbier together-and it has never changed since he died, a century ago. and old gerontius was my great-great-grandfat

'but the sun at any rate must peep in sometimes.' said merry. 'it does not look or feel at all like bilbo's description of mirkwood. that was all dark and black, and the home of dark black things. this is just dim, and frightfully tree-ish. you can't imagine animals living here at all, or staying for long.'
'no, nor hobbits,' said pippin. 'and i don't like the thought of trying to get through it either. nothing to eat for a hundred miles, i should guess. how are our supplies?'
'low,' said merry. 'we ran off with nothing but a couple of spare packets of l

embas, and left everything else behind.' they looked at what remained of the elven-cakes: broken fragments for about five meagre days, that was all. 'and not a wrap or a blanket,' said merry. 'we shall be cold tonight, whichever way we go.'
'well, we'd better decide on the way now,' said pippin. 'the morning must be getting on.'
just then they became aware of a yellow light that had appeared, some way further on into the wood: shafts of sunlight seemed suddenly to have pierced the forest-roof.
'hullo!' said merry. 'the sun must have run into a cloud while we've been under these trees, and now she has run out again; or else she has climbed high enough to look down through some openi

them.
in the face of the stony wall there was something like a stair: natural perhaps, and made by the weathering and splitting of the rock, for it was rough and uneven. high up, almost level with the tops of forest-trees, there was a shelf under a cliff. nothing grew there but a few grasses and weeds at its edge, and one old stump of a tree with only two bent branches left: it looked almost like the figure of some gnarled old man, standing there, blinking in the morning-light.
'up we go!' said merry joyfully. 'now for a breath of air, and a sight of the land!'
they climbed and scrambled up the rock. if the stair had been made it was for bigger feet and longer legs than theirs. they were too eager to be surprised at the remarkable way in which the cuts and sores of their captivity had healed and their vigour had returned. they came at length to the edge of the shelf almost at the feet of the old stump; then they sprang up and turned round with their backs to the hill, breathing deep, and lo

'the wind's changing,' said merry. 'it's turned east again. it feels cool up here.'
'yes,' said pippin; 'i'm afraid this is only a passing gleam, and it will all go grey again. what a pity! this shaggy old forest looked so different in the sunlight. i almost felt i liked the place.'
'almost felt you liked the forest! that's good! that's uncommonly kind of you,' said a strange voice. 'turn round and let me have a look at your faces. i almost feel that i dislike you both, but do not let us be hasty. turn round!' a large knob-knuc

still amazed, no longer felt afraid. under those eyes he felt a curious suspense, but not fear. 'please.' he said, 'who are you? and what are you?'
a queer look came into the old eyes, a kind of wariness; the deep wells were covered over. 'hrum, now,' answered the voice; 'well, i am an ent, or that's what they call me. yes, ent is the word. the ent, i am, you might say, in your manner of speaking. fangorn is my name according to some, treebeard others make it. treebeard will do.'
'an ent?' said merry. 'what's that? but what do you call yourself? what's your real name?'
'hoo now!' replied treebeard. 'hoo! now that would be telling! not so hasty. and i am doing the asking. you are in my country. what are you, i wonder? i cannot place you. you do not seem to come in the old lists that i learned when i was young. but that was a long, long time ago, and they may have made new lists. let me see! let me see! how did it go?

'half-grown hobbits, the hole-dwellers.
put us in amongst the four, next to man (the big people) and you've got it.'
'hm! not bad, not bad,' said treebeard. 'that would do. so you live in holes, eh? it sounds very right and proper. who calls you hobbits, though? that does not sound elvish to me. elves made all the old words: they began it.'
'nobody else calls us hobbits; we call ourselves that,

'there is quite a lot going on,' said merry: 'and even if we tried to be quick, it would take a long time to tell. but you told us not to be hasty. ought we to tell you anything so soon? would you think it rude, if we asked what you are going to do with us, and which side you are on? and did you know gandalf?'
'yes, i do know him: the only wizard that really cares about trees ' said treebeard. 'do you know him?'

'i do not know. you might call it far, perhaps. but what does that matter?'
'well, you see, we have lost all our belongings,' said merry. 'we have only a little food.'

'like the old forest away to the north, do you mean?' asked merry.
'aye, aye. something like, but much worse. i do not doubt there is some shadow of the great darkness lying there still away north; and bad memories are handed down. but there are hollow dales in this land where the darkness has never been lifted, and the trees are older than i am. still, we do what we can. we keep off strangers and the foolhardy; and we train and we teach, we walk and we weed.

on the right side of the bay there was a great bed on low legs; not more than a couple of feet high, covered deep in dried grass and bracken. treebeard lowered himself slowly on to this (with only the slightest sign of bending at his middle), until he lay at full length, with his arms behind his head, looking up at the ceiling. upon which lights were flickering, like the play of leaves in the sunshine. merry and pippin sat beside him on pillows of grass.

the hobbits began to tell him the story of their adventures ever since they left hobbiton. they followed no very clear order, for they interrupted one another continually, and treebeard often stopped the speaker, and went back to some earlier point, or jumped forward asking questions about later events. they said nothing whatever about the ring, and did not tell him why they set out or wher

'how very sad!' said pippin. 'how was it that they all died?'
'they did not die!' said treebeard. 'i never said died. we lost them, i said. we lost them and we cannot find them.' he sighed. 'i thought most folk knew that. there were songs about the hunt of the ents for the entwives sung among elves and men from mirkwood to gondor. they cannot be quite forgotten.'
'well, i am afraid the songs have not come west over the mountains to the shire,' said merry. 'won't you tell us some more, or sing us one of the songs?'
'yes, i will indeed,' said treebeard, seeming pleased with the request. 'but i cannot tell it properly, only in short; and then we must end our talk: tomorrow we have councils to call, and work to do, and maybe a journey to begin.'
'it is rather a strange and sad story,' he went on after a pause. 'when the world was young, and the woods were wide and wild, the ents and the entwives - and there were entmaidens then: ah! the loveliness

treebeard ended his song. 'that is how it goes,' he said. 'it is elvish, of course: lighthearted, quickworded, and soon over. i daresay it is fair enough. but the ents could say more on their side, if they had time! but now i am going to stand up and take a little sleep. where will you stand?'
'we usually lie down to sleep,' said merry. 'we shall be all right where we are.'
'lie down to sleep!' said treebeard. 'why of course you do! hm, hoom: i was forgetting: singing that song put me in mind of old times; almost thought that i was talking to young entings, i did. well, you can lie on the bed. i am going to stand in the rain. good night!'

they woke to find a cool sun shining into the great court, and on to the floor of the bay. shreds of high cloud were overhead, running on a stiff easterly wind. treebeard was not to be seen; but while merry and pippin were bathing in the basin by the arch, they heard him humming and singing, as he came up the path between the trees.
'hoo, ho! good morning, merry and pippin!' he boomed, when he saw them. 'you sleep long. i have been many a hundred strides already today. now we will have a drink, and go to entmoot.'
he poured them out two full bowls from a stone jar; but from a different jar. the taste was not the same as it had been the night before: it was earthier and richer, more sustaining and

scanty. above these the hobbits saw thickets of birch and rowan, and beyond them dark climbing pinewoods. soon treebeard turned a little away from the hills and plunged into deep groves, where the trees were larger, taller, and thicker than any that the hobbits had ever seen before. for a while they felt faintly the sense of stifling which they had noticed when they first ventured into fangorn, but it soon passed. treebeard did not talk to them. he hummed to himself deeply and thoughtfully, but merry and pippin caught no proper words: it sounded like boom, boom, rumboom, boorar, boom, boom, dahrar boom boom, dahrar boom, and so on with a constant change of note and rhythm. now and again they thought they heard an answer, a hum or a quiver of sound, that seemed to come out of the earth, or from boughs above their heads, or perhaps from the boles of the trees; but treebeard did not stop or turn his head to either side.

he 'ent-strides' but had failed, getting lost at about three thousand - when treebeard began to slacken his pace. suddenly he stopped, put the hobbits down, and raised his curled hands to his mouth so that they made a hollow tube; then he blew or called through them. a great hoom, hom rang out like a deep-throated horn in the woods, and seemed to echo from the trees. far off there came from several directions a similar hoom, hom, hoom that was not an echo but an answer.
treebeard now perched merry and pippin on his shoulders and strode on again, every now and then sending out another horn-call, and each time the answers came louder and nearer. in this way they came at last to what looked like an impenetrable wall of dark evergreen trees, trees of a kind that the hobbits had never seen before: they branched out right from the roots, and were densely clad in dark glossy leaves like thornless holly, and they bore many stiff upright flower-spikes with large shining olive-coloured buds.

at first merry and pippin were struck chiefly by the variety that they saw: the many shapes, and colours, the differences in girth; and height, and length of leg and arm; and in the number of toes and fingers (anything from three to nine). a few seemed more or less related to treebeard, and reminded them of beech-trees or oaks. but there were other kinds. some recalled the chestnut: brown-skinned ents with large splayfingered hands, and short thick legs. some recalled the ash: tall straight grey ents with man

treebeard was immediately aware of him. 'hm, ha, hey, my pippin!' he said, and the other ents all stopped their chant. 'you are a hasty folk, i was forgetting; and anyway it is wearisome listening to a speech you do not understand. you may get down now. i have told your names to the entmoot, and they have seen you, and they have agreed that you are not orcs, and that a new line shall be put in the old lists. we have got no further yet, but that is quick work for an entmoot. you and merry can stroll about in the dingle, if you like. there is a well of good water, if you need refreshing, away yonder in the north bank. there are still some words to speak before the moot really begins. i will come and see you again, and tell you how things are going.'
he put the hobbits down. before they walked away, they bowed low. this feat seemed to amuse the ents very much, to judge by the tone of their murmurs, and the flicker of their eyes; but they soon turned back to their own business. mer

ry and pippin climbed up the path that came in from the west, and looked through the opening in the great hedge. long tree-clad slopes rose from the lip of the dingle, and away beyond them, above the fir-trees of the furthest ridge there rose, sharp and white, the peak of a high mountain. southwards to their left they could see the forest falling away down into the grey distance. there far away there was a pale green glimmer that merry guessed to be a glimpse of the plains of rohan.
'i wonder where isengard is?' said pippin.
'i don't know quite where we are,' said merry; 'but that peak is probably methedras, and as far as i can remember the ring of isengard lies in a fork or deep cleft at the end of the mountains. it is probably down behind this great ridge. there seems to be a smoke or haze over there, left of the peak, don't you think?'

'will you really break the doors of isengard?' asked merry.
'ho, hm, well, we could, you know! you do not know, perhaps, how strong we are. maybe you have heard of trolls? they are mighty strong. but trolls are only counterfeits, made by the enemy in the great darkness, in mockery of ents, as orcs were of elves. we are stronger than trolls. we are made of the bones of the earth. we can split stone like the roots of trees, only quicker, far quicker, if our minds are roused! if we are not hewn down, or destroyed by fire or blast of sorcery, we could spli

'nor do i know why an orc was carrying them away. not to help them to escape, we may be sure. nay, rather i think that i now begin to understand a matter that has puzzled me from the beginning: why when boromir had fallen were the orcs content with the capture of merry an

with that the three hunters plunged into the forest of fangorn. legolas and gimli left the tracking to aragorn. there was little for him to see. the floor of the forest was dry and covered with a drift of leaves; but guessing that the fugitives would stay near the water, he returned often to the banks of the stream. so it was that he came upon the place where merry and pippin had drunk and bathed their feet. there plain for all to see were the footprints of two hobbits, one somewhat smaller than the other.
'this is good tidings,' said aragorn. 'yet the marks are two days old and it seems that at this point the hobbits left the water-side.'
'then what shall we do now?' said gimli. 'we cannot pursue them through the whole fastness of fangorn. we have come ill supplied. if we do not find them soon, we shall be of no use to them, except to sit down beside the

he stepped down from the rock, and picking up his grey cloak wrapped it about him: it seemed as if the sun had been shining, but now was hid in cloud again.

'yes, i am white now,' said gandalf. 'indeed i am saruman, one might almost say, saruman as he should have been. but come now, tell me of yourselves! i have passed through fire and deep water, since we parted. i have forgotten much that i thought i knew, and learned again much

that we have endured of late has seemed so grievous as the treason of isengard. even reckoned as a lord and captain saruman has grown very strong. he threatens the men of rohan and draws off their help from minas tirith, even as the main blow is approaching from the east. yet a treacherous weapon is ever a danger to the hand. saruman also had a mind to capture the ring, for himself, or at least to snare some hobbits for his evil purposes. so between them our enemies have contrived only to bring merry and pippin with marvellous speed, and in the nick of time, to fangorn, where otherwise they would never have come at all!

'no, good sir, the matter escaped him,' answered merry gravely 'he has been much occupied. our orders came from treebeard, who has taken over the management of isengard. he commanded me to welcome the lord of rohan with fitting words. i have done my best.'

'and now that the great ones have gone to discuss high matters,' said legolas, 'the hunters can perhaps learn the answers to their own small riddles. we tracked you as far as the forest, but there are still many things that i should like to know the truth of.'
'and there is a great deal, too, that we want to know about you ' said merry. 'we have learnt a few things through treebeard, the old ent, but that is not nearly enough.'
'all in good time,' said legolas. 'we were the hunters, and you should give an account of yourselves to us first.'
'or second,' said gimli. 'it would go better after a meal. t have a sore head; and it is past mid-day. you truants might make amends by finding us some of the plunder that you spoke of. food and drink would pay off some of my score against you.'
'then you shall have it,' said pippin. 'will

'less than an eye!' said gimli. 'but i will not go into any orc-house nor touch orcs' meat or anything that they have mauled.'
'we wouldn't ask you to,' said merry. 'we have had enough of orcs ourselves to last a life-time. but there were many other folk in isengard. saruman kept enough wisdom not to trust his orcs. he had men to guard his gates: some of his most faithful servants, i suppose. anyway they were favoured and got good provisions.'
'and pipe-weed?' asked gimli.
'no, i don't think so,' merry laughed. 'but that is another story, which can wait until after lunch.'
'well let us go and have lunch then!' said the dwarf.

aragorn and his companions sat themselves down at one end of a long table, and the hobbits disappeared through one of the inner doors. 'store-room in there, and above the woods, luckily,' said pippin, as they came back laden with dishes, bowls, cups, knives, and food of various sorts.
'and you need not turn up your nose at the provender, master gimli,' said merry. 'this is not orc-stuff, but man-food, as treebeard calls it. will you have wine or beer? there's a barrel inside there - very passable. and this is first-rate salted pork. or i can cut you some rashers of bacon and broil them, if you like. i am sorry there is no green stuff: the deliveries have been rather interrupted in the last few days! i cannot offer you anything to follow but butter and honey for your bread. are you content?'
'indeed yes,' said gimli. 'the score is much reduced.'

 for days before that. it seems a long while since we could eat to heart's content.'
'it does not seem to have done you any harm,' said aragorn. 'indeed you look in the bloom of health.'
'aye, you do indeed,' said gimli, looking them up and down over the top of his cup. 'why, your hair is twice as thick and curly as when we parted; and i would swear that you have both grown somewhat, if that is possible for hobbits of your age. this treebeard at any rate has not starved you.'
'he has not,' said merry. 'but ents only drink, and drink is not enough for content. treebeard's draughts may be nourishing, but one feels the need of something solid. and even lembas is none the worse for a change.'
'you have drunk of the waters of the ents, have you?' said legolas. 'ah, then i think it is likely that gimli's eyes do not deceive him. strange songs have been sung of the draughts of fangorn.'
'many strange tales have been told about that land,' said aragorn. 'i have never entered it. come, tell me more

 tried a few fumbling words that trailed off into silence. 'oh, well,' he went on, 'you have seen some at a distance, already-they saw you at any rate, and reported that you were on the way-and you will see many others, i expect, before you leave here. you must form your own ideas.'
'now, now!' said gimli. 'we are beginning the story in the middle. i should like a tale in the right order, starting with that strange day when our fellowship was broken.'
'you shall have it, if there is time,' said merry. 'but first-if you have finished eating-you shall fill your pipes and light up. and then for a little while we can pretend that we are all back safe at bree again, or in rivendell.'
he produced a small leather bag full of tobacco. 'we have heaps of it,' he said; 'and you can all pack as much as you wish, when we go. we did some salvage-work this morning, pippin and i. there are lots of things floating about. it was pippin who found two small barrels, washed up out of some cellar or store-house,

 i suppose. when we opened them, we found they were filled with this: as fine a pipe-weed as you could wish for, and quite unspoilt.'
gimli took some and rubbed it in his palms and sniffed it. 'it feels good, and it smells good,' he said.
'it is good!' said merry. 'my dear gimli, it is longbottom leaf! there were the hornblower brandmarks on the barrels, as plain as plain. how it came here, i can't imagine. for saruman's private use. i fancy. i never knew that it went so far abroad. but it comes in handy now?'
'it would,' said gimli, 'if i had a pipe to go with it. alas, i lost mine in moria, or before. is there no pipe in all your plunder?'
'no, i am afraid not,' said merry. 'we have not found any, not even here in the guardrooms. saruman kept this dai

y, or would if you strange folk did not wreathe yourselves in smoke. what of the tale?'
'well, my tale begins with waking up in the dark and finding myself all strung-up in an orc-camp,' said pippin. 'let me see, what is today?'
'the fifth of march in the shire-reckoning,' said aragorn. pippin made some calculations on his fingers. 'only nine days ago!' he said.1 'it seems a year since we were caught. well, though half of it was like a bad dream, i reckon that three very horrible days followed. merry will correct me, if i forget anything important: i am not going into details: the whips and the filth and stench and all that; it does not bear remembering.' with that he plunged into an account of boromir's last fight and the orc-march from emyn muil to the forest. the others nodded as the various points were fitted in with their guesses.
'here are some treasures that you let fall,' said aragorn. 'you will be glad to have them back.' he loosened his belt from under his cloak and took from it t

'well!' said merry. 'i never expected to see those again! i marked a few orcs with mine; but uglúk took them from us. how he glared! at first i thought he was going to stab me, but he threw the things away as if they burned him.'
'and here also is your brooch, pippin,' said aragorn. 'i have kept it safe, for it is a very precious thing.'
'i know,' said pippin. 'it was a wrench to let it go; but what else could i do?'
'nothing else,' answered aragorn. 'one who cannot cast away a treasure at need is in fetters. yo

'the cutting of the bands on your wrists, that was smart work!' said gimli. 'luck served you there; but you seized your chance with both hands, one might say.'
'and set us a pretty riddle,' said legolas. 'i wondered if you had grown wings!'
'unfortunately not,' said pippin. 'but you did not know about grishnákh.' he shuddered and said no more, leaving merry to tell of those last horrible moments: the pawing hands, the hot breath, and the dreadful strength of grishnákh's hairy arms.
'all this about the orcs of barad-dûr, lugbúrz as they call it, makes me uneasy,' said aragorn. 'the dark lord already knew too much and his servants also; and grishnákh evidently sent some message across the river after the quarrel. the red eye will be looking towards isengard. but saruman at any rate is in a cleft stick of his own cutting.'

'we caught a glimpse of the old villain, or so gandalf hints,' said gimli. 'on the edge of the forest.'
'when was that?' asked pippin.
'five nights ago,' said aragorn.
'let me see,' said merry: 'five nights ago-now we come to a part of the story you know nothing about. we met treebeard that morning after the battle; and that night we were at wellinghall, one of his ent-houses. the next morning we went to entmoot, a gathering of ents, that is, and the queerest thing i have ever seen in my life. it lasted all that day and the next; and we spent the nights with an ent called quickbeam. and then late in the afternoon in the third day of their moot, the ents suddenly blew up. it was amazi

there was very much more. a great deal of the song had no words, and was like a music of horns and drums. it was very exciting. but i thought it was only marching music and no more, just a song - until i got here. i know better now.'
'we came down over the last ridge into nan curunír, after night had fallen,' merry continued. 'it was then that i first had the feeling that the forest itself was moving behind us. i thought i was dreaming an entish dream, but pippin had noticed it too. we were both frightened; but we did not find out more about it until later.
'it was the huorns, or so the ents call them in "short language". treebeard won't say much about them, but i think they are ents that have become almost like trees, at least to look at. they stand here and there in the wood or under its eaves, silent,

not so obviously orc-like as most of these were.'
'i thought of him too,' said aragorn. 'we had many of these half-orcs to deal with at helm's deep. it seems plain now that that southerner was a spy of saruman's; but whether he was working with the black riders, or for saruman alone, i do not know. it is difficult with these evil folk to know when they are in league, and when they are cheating one another.'
'well, of all sorts together, there must have been ten thousand at the very least,' said merry. 'they took an hour to pass out of the gates. some went off down the highway to the fords, and some turned away µ and went eastward. a bridge has been built down there, about a mile away, where the river runs in a very deep channel. you could see it now, if you stood up. they were all singing with harsh voices, and laughing, making a hideous din. i thought things looked very black for rohan. but treebeard did not move. he said: 'my business is with isengard tonight, with rock and stone.'
'but,

 shafts all over the plain began to spout and belch. several of the ents got scorched and blistered. one of them, beechbone i think he was called, a very tall handsome ent, got caught in a spray of some liquid fire and burned like a torch: a horrible sight.
'that sent them mad. i thought that they had been really roused before; but i was wrong. i saw what it was like at last. it was staggering. they roared and boomed and trumpeted, until stones began to crack and fall at the mere noise of them. merry and i lay on the ground and stuffed our cloaks into our ears. round and round the rock of orthanc the ents went striding and storming like a howling gale, breaking pillars, hurling avalanches of boulders down the shafts, tossing up huge slabs of stone into the air like leaves. the tower was in the middle of a spinning whirlwind. i saw iron posts and blocks of masonry go rocketing up hundreds of feet, and smash against the windows of orthanc. but treebeard kept his head. he had not had any burns

'we were just wondering where it would be safe to lie and get some sleep, when the most amazing thing of all happened. there was the sound of a rider coming swiftly up the road. merry and i lay quiet, and treebeard hid himself in the shadows under the arch. suddenly a great horse came striding up, like a flash of silver. it was already dark. but i could see the rider's face clearly: it seemed to shine, and all his clothes were white. i just sat up, staring, with my mouth open. i tried to call out, and couldn't.

'"treebeard," said gandalf. "i need your help. you have done much, but i need more. i have about ten thousand orcs to manage."
'then those two went off and had a council together in some corner. it must have seemed very hasty to treebeard, for gandalf was in a tremendous hurry, and was already talking at a great pace, before they passed out of hearing. they were only away a matter of minutes, perhaps a quarter of an hour. then gandalf came back to us, and he seemed relieved, almost merry. he did say he was glad to see us, then.
'"but gandalf," i cried, "where have you been? and have you seen the others?"
'"wherever i have been, i am back," he answered in the genuine gandalf manner. "yes, i have seen some of the others. but news must wait. this is a perilous night, and i must ride fast. but the dawn may be brighter; and if so, we shall meet again. take care of yourselves, and keep away from orthanc! good-bye!"
'treebeard was very thoughtful after gandalf had gone. he had evident

'he was,' said aragorn; 'and also saruman's spy and servant in rohan. fate has not been kinder to him than he deserves. the sight of the ruin of all that he thought so strong and magnificent must have been almost punishment enough. but i fear that worse awaits him.'
'yes, i don't suppose treebeard sent him to orthanc out of kindness,' said merry. 'he seemed rather grimly delighted with the business and was laughing to himself when he went to get his bathe and drink. we spent a busy time after that, searching the flotsam, and rummaging about. we found two or three store-rooms in different places nearby, above the flood-level. but treebeard sent some ents down, and they carried off a great deal of the stuff.

'yes,' said pippin. 'it was the 1417 crop, that is last year's; no, the year before, of course, now: a good year.'
'ah well, whatever evil was afoot is over now, i hope; or else it is beyond our reach at present,' said aragorn. 'yet i think i shall mention it to gandalf, small matter though it may seem among his great affairs.'
'i wonder what he is doing,' said merry. 'the afternoon is getting on. let us go and look round! you can enter isengard now at any rate, strider, if you want to. but it is not a very cheerful sight.'

chapter 10

the voice of saruman

they passed through the ruined tunnel and stood upon a heap of stones, gazing at the dark rock of orthanc, and its many windows, a menace still in the desolation that lay all about it. the waters had now nearly all subsided. here and there gloomy pools remained, covered with scum and wreckage; but most

ng drunkenly this way and that. at the rim of the shattered bowl there lay vast mounds and slopes, like the shingles cast up by a great storm; and beyond them the green and tangled valley ran up into the long ravine between the dark arms of the mountains. across the waste they saw riders picking their way; they were coming from the north side, and already they were drawing near to orthanc.
'there is gandalf, and théoden and his men!' said legolas. 'let us go and meet them!'
'walk warily!' said merry. 'there are loose slabs that may tilt up and throw you down into a pit, if you don't take care.'
they followed what was left of the road from the gates to orthanc, going slowly, for the flag-stones were cracked and slimed. the riders, seeing them approach, halted under the shadow of the rock and waited for them. gandalf rode forward to meet them.
'well, treebeard and i have had some interesting discussions, and made a few plans,' he said; 'and we have all had some much-needed rest. now we must

be going on again. i hope you companions have all rested, too, and refreshed yourselves?'
'we have,' said merry. 'but our discussions began and ended in smoke. still we feel less ill-disposed towards saruman than we did.'
'do you indeed?' said gandalf. 'well, i do not. i have now a last task to do before i go: i must pay saruman a farewell visit. dangerous, and probably useless; but it must be done. those of you who wish may come with me - but beware! and do not jest! this is not the time for it.'
'i will come,' said gimli. 'i wish to see him and learn if he really looks like you.'
'and how will you lear

'nay!' said gimli. 'legolas and i wish for a closer view. we alone here represent our kindred. we also will come behind.'
'come then!' said gandalf, and with that he climbed the steps, and théoden went beside him.
the riders of rohan sat uneasily upon their horses, on either side of the stair, and looked up darkly at the great tower, fearing what might befall their lord. merry and pippin sat on the bottom step, feeling both unimportant and unsafe.
'half a sticky mile from here to the gate!' muttered pippin. 'i wish i could slip off back to the guardroom unnoticed! what did we come for? we are not wanted.'
gandalf stood before the door of orthanc and beat on it with his staff. it rang with a hollow sound. 'saruman, saruman!' he cried in a loud commanding voice. 'saruman come forth!'
for some time there was no answer. at last the window above the door was unbarred, hut

'it is the end,' said gandalf. 'let us go.'
they turned their backs on the doors of orthanc, and went down. the riders hailed the king with joy, and saluted gandalf. the spell of saruman was broken: they had seen him come at call, and crawl away, dismissed.
'well, that is done,' said gandalf. 'now i must find treebeard and tell him how things have gone.'
'he will have guessed, surely?' said merry. 'were they likely to end any other way?'
'not likely,' answered gandalf, 'though they came to the balance of a hair. but i had reasons for trying; some merciful and some less so. first saruman was shown that the power of his voice was waning. he cannot be both tyrant and counsellor. when the plot is ripe it remains no longer secret. yet he fell into the trap, and tried to deal with his victims piece-meal, while others listened. then i gave him a last choice and a fair one: to renounce both mor

they shall remain friends as long as leaves are renewed. fare you well! but if you hear news up in your pleasant land, in the shire, send me word! you know what i mean: word or sight of the entwives. come yourselves if you can!'
'we will!' said merry and pippin together, and they turned away hastily. treebeard looked at them, and was silent for a while, shaking his head thoughtfully. then he turned to gandalf.
'so saruman would not leave?' he said. 'i did not think he would. his heart is as rotten as a black huorn's. still, if i were overcome and all my trees destroyed, i would not come while i had one dark hole left to hide in.'
'no,' said gandalf. 'but you have not plotted to cover all the world with your trees and choke all other living

chapter 11
the palantír
the sun was sinking behind the long western arm of the mountains when gandalf and his companions, and the king with his riders, set out again from isengard. gandalf took merry behind him, and aragorn took pippin. two of the king's men went on ahead, riding swiftly, and passed soon out of sight down into the valley. the others followed at an easy pace.
ents in a solemn row stood like statues at the gate, with their long arms uplifted, but they made no sound. merry and pippin looked back, when they had passed some way down the winding road. sunlight was still shining in the sky, but long shadows reached over isengard: grey ruins falling into darkness. treebeard stood a

obbits thought of their first meeting, upon the sunny ledge far away on the borders of fangorn.
they came to the pillar of the white hand. the pillar was still standing, but the graven hand had been thrown down and broken into small pieces. right in the middle of the road the long forefinger lay, white in the dusk, its red nail darkening to black.
'the ents pay attention to every detail!' said gandalf.
they rode on, and evening deepened in the valley.
'are we riding far tonight, gandalf?' asked merry after a while. 'i don't know how you feel with small rag-tag dangling behind you; but the rag-tag is tired and will be glad to stop dangling and lie down.'
'so you heard that?' said gandalf. 'don't let it rankle! be thankful no longer words were aimed at you. he had his eyes on you. if it is any comfort to your pride, i should say that, at the moment, you and pippin are more in his thoughts than all the rest of us. who you are; how you came there, and why; what you know; whether you were captur

ed, and if so, how you escaped when all the orcs perished - it is with those little riddles that the great mind of saruman is troubled. a sneer from him, meriadoc, is a compliment, if you feel honoured by his concern.'
'thank you!' said merry. 'but it is a greater honour to dangle at your tail, gandalf. for one thing, in that position one has a chance of putting a question a second time. are we riding far tonight?'
gandalf laughed. 'a most unquenchable hobbit! all wizards should have a hobbit or two in their care - to teach them the meaning of the word, and to correct them. i beg your pardon. but i have given thought even to these simple matters. we will ride for a few hours, gently, until we come to the end of the valley. tomorrow

, we meant to go straight from isengard back to the king's house at edoras over the plains, a ride of some days. but we have taken thought and changed the plan. messengers have gone ahead to helm's deep, to warn them that the king is returning tomorrow. he will ride from there with many men to dunharrow by paths among the hills. from now on no more than two or three together are to go openly over the land, by day or night, when it can be avoided.'
'nothing or a double helping is your way!' said merry. 'i am afraid i was not looking beyond tonight's bed. where and what are helm's deep and all the rest of it? i don't know anything about this country.'
'then you'd best learn something, if you wish to understand what is happening. but not just now, and not from me: i have too many pressing things to think about.'
'all right, i'll tackle strider by the camp-fire: he's less testy. but why all this secrecy? i thought we'd won the battle!'
yes, we have won, but only the first victor and that in its

ted earth. thornbushes grew thick upon the low banks, and under them they made their camp, two hours or so before the middle of the night. they lit a fire in a hollow, down among the roots of a spreading hawthorn, tall as a tree, writhen with age; but hale in every limb. buds were swelling at each twig's tip.
guards were set, two at a watch. the rest, after they had supped, wrapped themselves in a cloak and blanket and slept. the hobbits lay in a corner by themselves upon a pile of old bracken. merry was sleepy, but pippin now seemed curiously restless. the bracken cracked and rustled, as he twisted and turned.
'what's the matter?' asked merry. 'are you lying on an ant-hill?'
'no,' said pippin, 'but i'm not comfortable. i wonder how long it is since i slept in a bed?'
merry yawned. 'work it out on your fingers!' he said. 'but you must know how long it is since we left lórien.'
'oh, that!' said pippin. 'i mean a real bed in a bedroom.'
'well, rivendell then,' said merry. 'but i could sleep

'you had the luck, merry,' said pippin softly, after a long pause. 'you were riding with gandalf.'
'well, what of it?'
'did you get any news, any information out of him?'
'yes, a good deal. more than usual. but you heard it all or most of it: you were close by, and we were talking no secrets. but you can go with him tomorrow, if you think you can get more out of him-and if he'll have you.'
'can i? good! but he's close, isn't he? not changed at all.'
'oh yes, he is!' said merry, waking up a little, and beginning to wonder what was bothering his companion. 'he has grown, or something. he can be both kinder and more alarming, merrier and more solemn than before, i think. he has changed; but we have not had a chance to see how much, yet. but think of the last part of that business with saruman! remember saruman was once gandalf's superior: head of the council, whatever that may be exactly. he was saruman the white. gandalf is the white now. saruman came when he was told,

then he was just told to go, and he went!'
'well, if gandalf has changed at all, then he's closer than ever that's all,' pippin argued. 'that-glass ball, now. he seemed mighty pleased with it. he knows or guesses something about it. but does he tell us what? no, not a word. yet i picked it up, and i saved it from rolling into a pool. here, i'll take that, my lad - that's all. i wonder what it is? it felt so very heavy.' pippin's voice fell very low as if he was talking to himself.
'hullo!' said merry. 'so that's what is bothering you? now, pippin my lad, don't forget gildor's saying - the one sam used to quote: do not meddle in the at fairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger.'
'but our whole life for months has been one long meddling in the affairs of wizards,' said pippin. 'i should like a bit of information as well as danger. i should like a look at that ball.'
'go to sleep!' said merry. 'you'll get information enough, sooner or later. my dear pippin, no took ever beat a b

'all right! what's the harm in my telling you what i should like: a look at that stone? i know i can't have it, with old gandalf sitting on it, like a hen on an egg. but it doesn't help much to get no more from you than a you-can't-have-it so-go-to-sleep!'
'well, what else could i say?' said merry. 'i'm sorry, pippin, but you really must wait till the morning. i'll be as curious as you like after breakfast, and i'll help in any way i can at wizard-wheedling. but i can't keep awake any longer. if i yawn any more, i shall split at the ears. good night!'
pippin said no more. he lay still now, but sleep remained far away; and it was not encouraged by the sound of merry breathing softly, asleep in a few minutes after saying good night. 'the thought of the dark globe seemed to grow stronger as

'forgive you?' said the wizard. 'tell me first what you have done!'
'i, i took the ball and looked at it,' stammered pippin; 'and i saw things that frightened me. and i wanted to go away, but i couldn't. and then he came and questioned me; and he looked at me, and, and that is all i remember.'
'that won't do,' said gandalf sternly. 'what did you see, and what did you say?'
pippin shut his eyes and shivered, but said nothing. they all stared at him in silence, except merry who turned away. but gandalf's face was still hard. 'speak!' he said.
in a low hesitating voice pippin began again, and slowly his words grew clearer and stronger. 'i saw a dark sky, and tall battlements,' he said. 'and tiny stars. it seemed very far away and long ago, yet hard and clear. then the stars went in and out-they were cut off by things with wings. very big, i think, really; but in the glass they looked like bats wheeling round the tower. i thought there were nine of them. one began t

ioned you, then and there, almost certainly you would have told all that you know, to the ruin of us all. but he was too eager. he did not want information only: he wanted you, quickly, so that he could deal with you in the dark tower, slowly. don't shudder! if you will meddle in the affairs of wizards, you must be prepared to think of such things. but come! i forgive you. be comforted! things have not turned out as evilly as they might.'
he lifted pippin gently and carried him back to his bed. merry followed, and sat down beside him. lie there and rest, if you can, pippin!' said gandalf. 'trust me. if you feel an itch in your palms again, tell me of it! such things can be cured. but anyway, my dear hobbit, don't put a lump of rock under my elbow again! now, i will leave you two together for a while.'
with that gandalf returned to the others, who were still standing by the orthanc-stone in troubled thought. 'peril comes in the night when least expected,' he said. 'we have had a narrow escap

'farewell! follow fast!' cried gandalf. 'away, shadowfax!'
the great horse tossed his head. his flowing tail flicked in the moonlight. then he leapt forward, spurning the earth, and was gone like the north wind from the mountains.
'a beautiful, restful night!' said merry to aragorn. 'some folk have wonderful luck. he did not want to sleep, and he wanted to ride with gandalf - and there he goes! instead of being turned into a stone himself to stand here for ever as a warning.'
'if you had been the first to lift the orthanc-stone, and not he, how would it be now?' said aragorn. 'you might have done worse. who can say? but now it is your luck to come with me, i fear. at once. go and get ready, and bring anything that pippin left behind. make haste!'

a comic rhyme, perhaps. now and again, you know, but not real poetry - so i can't tell you what i mean. it ought to be sung. you'd have to get strider, aragorn that is, or old mr. bilbo, for that. but i wish i could make a song about her. beautiful she is, sir! lovely! sometimes like a great tree in flower, sometimes like a white daffadowndilly, small and slender like. hard as di'monds, soft as moonlight. warm as sunlight, cold as frost in the stars. proud and far-off as a snow-mountain, and as merry as any lass i ever saw with daisies in her hair in springtime. but that's a lot o' nonsense, and all wide of my mark.'

ite stories. frodo was very brave. wasn't he, dad?" "yes, my boy, the famousest of the hobbits, and that's saying a lot."'
`it's saying a lot too much,' said frodo, and he laughed, a long clear laugh from his heart. such a sound had not been heard in those places since sauron came to middle-earth. to sam suddenly it seemed as if all the stones were listening and the tall rocks leaning over them. but frodo did not heed them; he laughed again. 'why, sam,' he said, 'to hear you somehow makes me as merry as if the story was already written. but you've left out one of the chief characters: samwise the stouthearted. "i want to hear more about sam, dad. why didn't they put in more of his talk, dad? that's what i like, it makes me laugh. and frodo wouldn't have got far without sam, would he, dad? " '
`now, mr. frodo,' said sam, 'you shouldn't make fun. i was serious. '
`so was i,' said frodo, 'and so i am. we're going on a bit too fast. you and i, sam, are still stuck in the worst places of the sto
