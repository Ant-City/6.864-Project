[CHARACTER] 
the character of [CHARACTER] (spelled mephistophilis
or mephistopheles by other authors) is one of the first in a long
tradition of sympathetic literary devils, which includes figures
like john milton's satan in paradise lost and johann von goethe's
mephistophilis in the nineteenth-century poem "faust." marlowe's
[CHARACTER] is particularly interesting because he has mixed
motives. on the one hand, from his first appearance he clearly intends
to act as an agent of faustus's damnation. indeed, he openly admits
it, telling faustus that "when we hear one rack the name of god,
/ abjure the scriptures and his savior christ, / we fly in hope
to get his glorious soul" (3.47-49).
it is [CHARACTER] who witnesses faustus's pact with lucifer,
and it is he who, throughout the play, steps in whenever faustus
considers repentance to cajole or threaten him into staying loyal
to hell.
	yet there is an odd ambivalence in [CHARACTER]. he
seeks to damn faustus, but he himself is damned and speaks freely
of the horrors of hell. in a famous passage, when faustus remarks
that the devil seems to be free of hell at a particular moment,
[CHARACTER] insists,

                    [w]hy this is hell, nor am i out of it.
                    think'st
thou that i, who saw the face of god,
                    and
tasted the eternal joys of heaven,
                    am not
tormented with ten thousand hells
                    in being
deprived of everlasting bliss? 
                    
                           
                           
                           (3.76-80)

again, when faustus blithely--and absurdly, given that
he is speaking to a demon--declares that he does not believe in hell,
[CHARACTER] groans and insists that hell is, indeed, real and
terrible, as faustus comes to know soon enough. before the pact
is sealed, [CHARACTER] actually warns faustus against making
the deal with lucifer. in an odd way, one can almost sense that
part of [CHARACTER] does not want faustus to make the same mistakes that
he made. but, of course, faustus does so anyway, which makes him
and [CHARACTER] kindred spirits. it is appropriate that these two
figures dominate marlowe's play, for they are two overly proud spirits
doomed to hell.
