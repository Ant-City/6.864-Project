eneath a low roof quite as
gracefully and like a supernatural creature, as it was possible
he could have done in any lofty hall.

and perhaps it was the pleasure the good spirit had in
showing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind,
generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor
men, that led him straight to scrooge's clerk's; for there he
went, and took scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and
on the threshold of the door the spirit smiled, and stopped
to bless bob cratchit's dwelling with the sprinkling of his
torch. think of that! bob had but fifteen "bob" a-week
himself; he pocketed on saturdays but fifteen copies of his
christian name; and yet the ghost of christmas present
blessed his four-roomed house!

then up rose mrs. cratchit, cratchit's wife, dressed out
but poorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons,
which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence; and
she laid the cloth, assisted by belinda cratchit, second of
her daughters, als

"no, no! there's father coming," cried the two young
cratchits, who were everywhere at once. "hide, martha,
hide!"

so martha hid herself, and in came little bob, the father,
with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe,
hanging down before him; and his threadbare clothes darned
up and brushed, to look seasonable; and tiny tim upon his
shoulder. alas for tiny tim, he bore a little crutch, and
had his limbs supported by an iron frame!

"why, where's our martha?" cried bob cratchit, looking
round.

"not coming," said mrs. cratchit.

"not coming!" said bob, with a sudden declension in his
high spirits; for he had been tim's blood horse all the way
from church, and had come home rampant. "not coming
upon christmas day!"

martha didn't like to see him disappointed, if it were only
in joke; so she came out prematurely from behind the closet
door, and ran into his arms, while the two young cratchits
hustled tiny tim, and bore him off into the wash-house,
that he

team! the pudding was out of
the copper. a smell like a washing-day! that was the
cloth. a smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook's next
door to each other, with a laundress's next door to that!
that was the pudding! in half a minute mrs. cratchit
entered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding,
like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half
of half-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with
christmas holly stuck into the top.

oh, a wonderful pudding! bob cratchit said, and calmly
too, that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by
mrs. cratchit since their marriage. mrs. cratchit said that
now the weight was off her mind, she would confess she had
had her doubts about the quantity of flour. everybody had
something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it
was at all a small pudding for a large family. it would have
been flat heresy to do so. any cratchit would have blushed
to hint at such a thing.

at last the dinner was all done

, the cloth was cleared, the
hearth swept, and the fire made up. the compound in the
jug being tasted, and considered perfect, apples and oranges
were put upon the table, and a shovel-full of chestnuts on the
fire. then all the cratchit family drew round the hearth, in
what bob cratchit called a circle, meaning half a one; and
at bob cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass.
two tumblers, and a custard-cup without a handle.

these held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as
golden goblets would have done; and bob served it out with
beaming looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and
cracked noisily. then bob proposed:

"a merry christmas to us all, my dears. god bless us!"

which all the family re-echoed.

"god bless us every one!" said tiny tim, the last of all.

he sat very close to his fa

the children drank the toast after her. it was the first of
their proceedings which had no heartiness. tiny tim drank
it last of all, but he didn't care twopence for it. scrooge
was the ogre of the family. the mention of his name cast
a dark shadow on the party, which was not dispelled for full
five minutes.

after it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than
before, from the mere relief of scrooge the baleful being done
with. bob cratchit told them how he had a situation in his
eye for master peter, which would bring in, if obtained, full
five-and-sixpence weekly. the two young cratchits laughed
tremendously at the idea of peter's being a man of business;
and peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from
between his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular
investments he should favour when he came into the receipt
of that bewildering income. martha, who was a poor
apprentice at a milliner's, then told the

; and it was a happier
house for this man's death! the only emotion that the
ghost could show him, caused by the event, was one of
pleasure.

"let me see some tenderness connected with a death," said
scrooge; "or that dark chamber, spirit, which we left just
now, will be for ever present to me."

the ghost conducted him through several streets familiar
to his feet; and as they went along, scrooge looked here and
there to find himself, but nowhere was he to be seen. they
entered poor bob cratchit's house; the dwelling he had
visited before; and found the mother and the children seated
round the fire.

quiet. very quiet. the noisy little cratchits were as
still as statues in one corner, and sat looking up at peter,
who had a book before him. the mother and her daughters
were engaged in sewing. but surely they were very quiet!

"'and he took a child, and set him in the midst of
them.'"

where had scrooge heard those words? he had not
dreamed them. the boy must have read them

"is it?" said scrooge. "go and buy it."

"walk-er!" exclaimed the boy.

"no, no," said scrooge, "i am in earnest. go and buy
it, and tell 'em to bring it here, that i may give them the
direction where to take it. come back with the man, and
i'll give you a shilling. come back with him in less than
five minutes and i'll give you half-a-crown!"

the boy was off like a shot. he must have had a steady
hand at a trigger who could have got a shot off half so fast.

"i'll send it to bob cratchit's!" whispered scrooge,
rubbing his hands, and splitting with a laugh. "he sha'n't
know who sends it. it's twice the size of tiny tim. joe
miller never made such a joke as sending it to bob's
will be!"

the hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady
one, but write it he did, somehow, and went down-stairs to
open the street door, ready for the coming of the poulterer's
man. as he stood there, waiting his arrival, the knocker
caught his eye.

"a merry christmas, bob!" said scrooge, with an earnestness
that could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the
back. "a merrier christmas, bob, my good fellow, than i
have given you, for many a year! i'll raise your salary, and
endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will discuss
your affairs this very afternoon, over a christmas bowl of
smoking bishop, bob! make up the fires, and buy another
coal-scuttle before you dot another i, bob cratchit!"


scrooge was better than his word. he did it all, and
infinitely more; and to tiny tim, who did not die, he was
a second father. he became as good a friend, as good a
master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or
any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old
world. some people laughed to see the alteration in him,
but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was
wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this
globe, for good, at which some p
