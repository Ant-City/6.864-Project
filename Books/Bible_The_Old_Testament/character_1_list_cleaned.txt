[CHARACTER] - 
                the
patriarch of the hebrew people. [CHARACTER] is traditionally called
"father [CHARACTER]" because the israelite people and their religion
descend from him. god establishes his covenant, or promise, with [CHARACTER],
and god develops an ongoing relationship with the israelites through
[CHARACTER]'s descendants. [CHARACTER] practices the monotheistic worship
of god, and his resilient faith in god, despite many challenges, sets
the pattern for the israelite religion's view 
of righteousness.
