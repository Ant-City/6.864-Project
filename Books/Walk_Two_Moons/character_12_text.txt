gth 'bob' (that's what they called it) with a long
fringe which they repeatedly shook out of their eyes. we once had a horse
who did that.

   everybody kept touching my hair. 'don't you ever cut it?' they said. 'can
you sit on it? how do you wash it? is it naturally black, like that? do you
use conditioner?' i couldn't tell if they liked my hair or if they thought i
looked like a whang-doodle.

   they all seemed to talk quite a lot, and everyone seemed to have braces on
their teeth. one girl, mary lou finney, said the most peculiar things, like out
of the blue she would say, 'omnipotent!' or 'beef brain!' i couldn't make any
sense of it. there were japanese twins (a brother and sister), who didn't
speak at all except to say 'yes, yes,' and 'yes, yes.' there were megan and
christy who jumped up and down like parched peas, moody beth ann, and
pink-cheeked alex. there was ben who drew cartoons all day long, and a
most peculiar teacher named mr. birkway.

   and then there was phoebe winterbottom. ben

phoebe, and nearly every- one else in my new class did not have much
fondness for these creatures.

   on the first day of class, when a dignified black spider was investigating
my desk, i cupped my hands around it, carried it to the open window, and set
it outside on the ledge. mary lou finney said, 'alpha and omega, will you
look at that!' beth am. was as white as milk. all around the room, people
were acting as if i had single-handedly taken on a fire-breathing dragon.

   during that next week, if an innocent spider was crawling toward
someone's desk, they would all yell, 'sal, get it!' when a wasp flew in the
window for a peek around the room, they said, 'sal, it's a wasp, get it!' and
once, a tiny green garden snake slithered along the baseboard and everyone
screamed, "sal, a sn

dn't,' gram said.

   'well, gol-dang, i was only asking--'

   'seems to me,' gram said, 'you've got enough to worry about,
concentrating on these roads, without worrying about gloria.

   gramps winked at me in the rear-view mirror. 'i think our gooseberry is
jealous' he said.

   'i am not,' gram said. 'tell about peeby, chickabiddy.'

   i didn't want gram and gramps to get in a fight over gloria, so i was
happy to continue telling phoebe's story. i was at phoebe's one saturday
morning when mary lou finney called and invited us over to her house.
phoebe's father was off playing golf, and phoebe's mother had just left for
the grocery store.

   phoebe went all around the house checking to make sure that the doors and
windows were locked. her mother had already done this, but she made
phoebe promise to do it as well. 'just in case,' mrs. winterbottom had said. i
was not sure 'just in case' what - maybe in case someone had stuck in and
opened all the windows and unlocked all the doors in the fifteen

 then he left. he just turned around, walked slowly down the porch
steps and on down the street. we waited until he had turned the corner
before we left. we ran all the way to mary lou's phoebe was certain that the
young man was going to ambush us. honestly. like i said, she has a vivid
imagination.


9. the message


   just before we reached mary lou's house, phoebe said, 'mary lou's family
is not nearly as civilized as ours.'

   'in what way?' i asked.

   'oh, you'll see,' phoebe said.

   mary lou finney and ben finney were both in our class at school. at first,
i thought mary lou and ben were sister and brother, but phoebe told me
they were cousins ben was living with mary lou's family temporarily.
apparently, there was always at least one stray relative living at the finneys
temporarily.

   it was complete pandemonium at the finneys mary lou had an older sister
and three brothers. in addition, there were her parents and ben. there were
footballs and basketballs lying all over the place, and

nd listen to you, and you alone.

   midway through the first class, mr. birkway asked if we had our summer
journals. i hadn't a clue as to what he was talking about. some of the other
students started nodding like crazy, and mr. birkway spread out his arms
and said, 'wonderful! i'm blessed!' he flung himself up and down the aisles,
receiving the journals as if they were manna from heaven. 'thank you,' he
said to each journal-giver.

   i was extensively worried. i had no journal.

   on top of mary lou finney's desk were six journals. six. mr. birkway
said. 'heavens. mercy. is it - can it be - shakespeare?' he counted the
journals. 'six! brilliant! magnificent!'


   christy and megan. two girls who had their own club called the ggp
(whatever that meant), were whispering over on the other side of the room
and casting malevolent looks in mary lou's direction. mary lou kept her
hand on top of the journals as mr. birkway reached for them. in a low voice
she said. 'i don't want you to read them.'

ine what might
have happened if the kiss had landed on ben's mouth. it was a shivery thing
to consider.

   i made it through the rest of my classes without losing control of my lips.
the day seemed to be returning to normal - until english class, that is. mr.
birkway came sailing into class carrying our journals i had forgotten all
about them. he was leaping all over the place exclaiming, 'dynamite!

unbelievable! incredible!' he said he couldn't wait to share the journals with
the class.

   mary lou finney said, 'share with the class?'

   mr. birkway said, 'not to worry! everyone has something magnificent to
say. i haven't read through every page yet, but i was so impressed that i
wanted to share some of these passages with you right away.'

   people were squirming all over the room. i was trying to remember what i
had written. mary lou leaned over to me and said, 'well, i'm not worried. i
wrote a special note in the front of mine distinctly asking him not to read
mine. mine was private.'

al,
slipping the yellow paper over it before anyone had a chance to examine the
cover for clues as to its author's identity. everyone took a deep breath. you
could see people poised nervously, waiting as tensely as if mr. birkway was
going to announce someone's execution. mr. birkway read:

   i think that betty [he changed the name, you could tell, because there was
no betty in our school] will go to hell because she always takes the lord's
name in vain. she says 'god!' every five seconds.

   mary lou finney was turning purple. 'who wrote that?' she said. 'did you,
christy? i'll bet you did.'

   christy stared down at her desk.


   'i do not say "god!" every five seconds. i do not. and i am not going to
hell.'

   mr. birkway tried to intervene. 'excuse--'

   'omnipotent,' mary lou said. 'that's what i say now i say, omnipotent!
and alpha and omega!'

   mr. birkway was desperately trying to explain what he had enjoyed about
that passage. he said that most of us are not aware that we might be u

 he liked this passage because it
showed that even though someone might be our best friend, he or she could
still drive us crazy. beth ann turned ail the way around in her seat and sent
wicked eyebrow-messages to mary lou.

   mr. birkway flipped ahead in the same journal to another passage. he
read:

   i think jeremiah [there was certainly no jeremiah in our school] is pig-
headed ... his skin is always pink ... and his hair is always clean and shiny ...
but he is really a jerk.

   i thought mary lou finney was going to fall out of her chair. alex was
bright, bright pink. he looked at mary lou as if she had recently plunged a

red hot stake into his heart. mary lou said, 'no - i - no, it isn't what you
think-i--

   misako said, 'what is jerk?' about twenty times

   mr. birkway tried to explain that he liked this pas- sage because it showed
conflicting feelings about someone.

   'i'll say it does,' alex said.

   the bell rang. first, you could hear sighs of relief from the people whose
journal

ing down at
his desk. the prickly feeling travelled all the way up to my neck and then
went skipping down my spine. he did write that, but he did not write it about
me.

   mr. birkway exclaimed, 'ah, love, ah, life!' sighing, he pulled out another
journal and read:

   jane doesn't know the first thing about boys. she once asked me what
kisses taste like, so you could tell she hadn't ever kissed anyone. i told her
that they taste like chicken, and she believed me. she is so dumb sometimes.

   mary lou finney almost jumped straight out of her chair. 'you cabbage
head.' she said to beth ann. 'you beef brain.' beth ann was winding a strand
of hair around and around and around her finger. mary lou stood up. 'i did
not believe you, and i do too know what they taste like, and it isn't chicken.

   mr. birkway looked astonished at this outburst. ben drew a cartoon. it
showed two stick-figures kissing. in the air over their heads was a cartoon
bubble with a chicken inside. the chicken was saying, 'bawk, ba
