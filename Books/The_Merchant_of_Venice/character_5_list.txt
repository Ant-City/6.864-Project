Jessica - 
                Although
she is Shylock's daughter, Jessica hates life in her father's house,
and elopes with the young Christian gentleman, Lorenzo. The fate
of her soul is often in doubt: the play's characters wonder if her
marriage can overcome the fact that she was born a Jew, and we wonder
if her sale of a ring given to her father by her mother is excessively
callous.
