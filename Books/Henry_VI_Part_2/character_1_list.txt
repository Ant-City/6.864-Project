Gloucester - 
      Named the protector of England until Henry is old enough to rule, Gloucester has long-standing tension with Beaufort. Margaret dislikes Gloucester because she believes he holds too much power over the throne. The other nobles believe Gloucester desires to seize the crown. However, Gloucester seems to be a genuinely noble man; he sticks up for the common people, and he believes his honorable behavior should speak for itself. Yet plots against him are too large, and Gloucester is murdered in his bed through the scheming of Suffolk, Somerset, Beaufort, and Margaret.
