most honour'd cleon, i must needs be gone;

the infant of your care; beseeching you
to give her princely training, that she may be
manner'd as she is born.

cleon.
fear not, my lord, but think
your grace, that fed my country with your corn,
for which the people's prayers still fall upon you,
must in your child be thought on.  if neglection
should therein make me vile, the common body,

whom our fast-growing scene must find
at tarsus, and by cleon train'd
in music, letters; who hath gain'd
of education all the grace,
which makes her both the heart and place
of general wonder. but, alack,
that monster envy, oft the wrack
of earned praise, marina's life
seeks to take off by treason's knife.
and in this kind hath our cleon
one daughter, and a wench full grown,
even ripe for marriage-rite; this maid
hight philoten: and it is said

be't when she weaved the sleided silk
with fingers long, small, white as milk;
or when she would with sharp needle wound,
the cambric, which she made more sound
by hurting it; or when to the lute
she sung, and made the night-bird mute
that still records with moan; or when
she would with rich and constant pen
vail to her mistress dian; still
this philoten contends in skill
with absolute marina: so
with the dove of paphos might the crow
vie feathers white.  marina gets
all praises, which are paid as debts,
and not as given. this so darks
in philoten all graceful marks,
that cleon's wife, with envy rare,
a present murderer does prepare
for good marina, that her daughter
might stand peerless by this slaughter.

to any living creature: believe me, la,
i never kill'd a mouse, nor hurt a fly:
i trod upon a worm against my will,

might equal yours, if both were justly weigh'd.

my derivation was from ancestors
who stood equivalent with mighty kings:

and to the world and awkward casualties
bound me in servitude.

i do think so. pray you, turn your eyes upon me.

my dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one
my daughter might have been: my queen's square brows;
her stature to an inch; as wand-like straight;
as silver-voiced; her eyes as jewel-like
and cased as richly; in pace another juno;
who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry,
the more she gives them speech. where do you li

pericles.
prithee, speak:
falseness cannot come from thee; for thou look'st
modest as justice, and thou seem'st a palace
for the crown'd truth to dwell in: i will believe thee,
and make my senses credit thy relation

like one i loved indeed. what were thy friends?

which was when i perceived thee -- that
