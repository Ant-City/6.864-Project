York - 
      Richard, the Duke of York, believes that he is the true king of England. Since King Henry's grandfather seized the throne illegally from Richard II, then the real legal heir should have been the offspring of the younger brothers of Richard II. Richard is descended from Richard II's eldest brother, whereas Henry VI is descended from Richard II's younger brother. With this claim, York has brought dissention to the court, arguing with other nobles in 1 Henry VI and staking his claim in 2 Henry VI. He agrees to let Henry rule during his lifetime and receive the crown on Henry's death, but York's son urges him to seize the crown sooner. York dies in battle in the first act.
