[CHARACTER]  - 
      geiger's young and handsome lover. lundgren is both despicable and endearing: his crude, limited vocabulary annoys marlowe while he is under his custody for killing brody. the boy kills brody thinking that brody has killed geiger, his lover. however, lundgren honors geiger's body in a ritualistic way, which makes us empathetic to what he may be feeling under his "tough kid" front.
