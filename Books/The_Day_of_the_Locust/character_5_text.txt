that's villa, he's a blinker, but still good. and that one's zapata,
twice winner, a tassel dom he is. and that's jujutla. my champ."

he opened the coop and lifted the bird out for tod. "a murderer is what
the guy is. speedy and how!"

the cock's plumage was green, bronze and copper. its beak was lemon
and its legs orange.

"he's beautiful," tod said.

"i'll say."

mig tossed the bird back into the coop and they went back to join the
others at the fire.

"when do we eat?" faye asked.

miguel tested the stove by spitting on it. he next found a large iron
skillet and began to scour it with sand. earle gave faye a knife and some
potatoes to peel, then picked up a burlap sack.

"i'll get the birds," he said.

tod went along with him. they followed a narrow path that looked as
though it had been used by sheep until they came to a tiny field, covered
with high, tufted grass. earle stopped behind a gum bush and held up his
hand to warn tod.

a mocking bird was singing near by. its song wa

point first, weighed down by the tiny drop of blood that trembled on the
tips of their quills.

the sun went down before they reached the camp again. it grew chilly and
tod was glad of the fire. faye shared her seat on the box with him and
they both leaned forward into the heat.

mig brought a jug of tequila from the hut. he filled a peanut butter jar
for faye and passed the jug to tod. the liquor smelled like rotten fruit,
but he liked the taste. when he had had enough, earle took it and then
miguel. they continued to pass it from hand to hand.

earle tried to show faye how plump the game was, but she wouldn't look.
he gutted the birds, then began cutting them into quarters with a pair of
heavy tin shears. faye held her hands over her ears in order not to hear
the soft click made by the blades as they cut through flesh and bone.
earle wiped the pieces with a rag and dropped them into the skillet where
a large piece of lard was already sputtering.

for all her squeamishness, faye ate as hea

ain and again, as though it were the one
thing he couldn't stand about earle and the mexican. for a man who was
incapable of hatred, he managed to draw a pretty horrible picture of the
bird.

"you never saw such a disgusting thing, the way it squats and turns its
head. the roosters have torn all the feathers off its neck and made its
comb all bloody and it has scabby feet covered with warts and it cackles
so nasty when they drop it into the pen."

"who drops it into what pen?'

"the mexican."

"miguel?"

"yes. he's almost as bad as his hen.'

"you've been to their camp?"

"camp?"

"in the mountains?"

"no. they're living in the garage. faye asked me if i minded if a friend
of hers lived in the garage for a while because he was broke. but i
didn't know about the chickens or the mexican...lots of people are out of
work nowadays."

"why don't you throw them out?"

"they're broke and they have no place to go. it isn't very comfortable
living in a garage."

"but if they don't behave?"

"it's just

st down on their luck like a lot of
people these days. there's an awful lot of unemployment going around."

"that's right," she said. "if they go, i go."

tod had guessed as much. he realized there was no use in saying anything.
homer was again signaling for him to keep quiet.

for some reason or other, faye suddenly became ashamed of herself. she
apologized to tod by offering to dance with him again, flirting as she
suggested it. tod refused.

she broke the silence that followed by a eulogy of miguel's game
chickens, which was really meant to be an excuse for herself. she
described what marvelous fighters the birds were, how much miguel loved
them and what good care he took of them.

homer agreed enthusiastically. tod remained silent. she asked him if he
had ever seen a cock fight and invited him to the garage for the next
night. a man from san diego was coming north with his birds to pit them
against miguel's.

when she turned to homer again, he leaned away as though she were going

s when the luminous color
seems to have been blown over the scene with an air brush. even the
darkest shadows held some purple.

a car stood in the driveway of the garage with its headlights on. they
could see several men in the corner of the building and could hear their
voices. someone laughed, using only two notes, ha-ha and ha-ha, over and
over again.

tod stepped ahead, to make himself known, in case they were taking
precautions against the police. when he entered the light, abe kusich and
miguel greeted him, but earle didn't.

"the fights are off," abe said. "that stinkola from diego didn't get
here."

claude came up and tod introduced him to the three men. the dwarf was
arrogant, miguel gracious and earle his usual wooden, surly self.

most of the garage floor had been converted into a pit, an oval space
about nine feet long and seven or eight wide. it was floored with an old
carpet and walled by a low, ragged fence made of odd pieces of lath and
wire. faye's coupe stood in the drivew

ay, placed so that its headlights
flooded the arena.

claude and tod followed abe out of the glare and sat down with him on an
old trunk in the back of the garage. earle and miguel came in and
squatted on their heels facing them. they were both wearing blue denims,
polka-dot shirts, big hats and high-heeled boots. they looked very
handsome and picturesque.

they sat smoking silently, all of them calm except the dwarf, who was
fidgety. although he had plenty of room, he suddenly gave tod a shove.

"get over, lard-ass," he snarled.

tod moved, crowding against claude, without saying anything. earle
laughed at tod rather than the dwarf, but the dwarf turned on him anyway.

"

caught him by the collar.
he didn't try to get loose, but leaned forward against his coat, like a
terrier in a harness, and wagged his great head from side to side.

"go on," he sputtered, "you fugitive from the western costume company,
you...you louse in a fright-wig, you."

earle would have been much less angry if he could have thought of a
snappy comeback. he mumbled something about a half-pint bastard, then
spat. he hit the instep of the dwarf's shoe with a big gob of spittle.

"nice shot," miguel said.

this was apparently enough for earle to consider himself the winner, for
he smiled and became quiet. the dwarf slapped tod's hand away from his
collar with a curse and settled down on the trunk again.

"he ought to wear gaffs," miguel said.

"i don't need them for a punk like that."

they all laughed and everything was fine again. abe leaned across tod to
speak to claude.

"it would have been a swell main," he said. "there was more than a dozen
guys here before you come and some of them

with real dough. i was going
to make book." he took out his wallet and gave him one of his business
cards.

"it was in the bag," miguel said. "i got five birds that would of won
easy and two sure losers. we would of made a killing."

"i've never seen a chicken fight," claude said. "in fact, i've never even
seen a game chicken."

miguel offered to show him one of his birds and left to get it. tod went
down to the car for the bottle of whiskey they had left in a side pocket.
when he got back, miguel was holding jujutala in the light. they all
examined the bird.

miguel held the cock firmly with both hands, somewhat in the manner that
a basketball is held, for an underhand toss. the bird had short, oval
wings and a heart-shaped tail that stood at right angles to its body. it
had a triangular head, like a snake's, terminating in a slightly curved
beak, thick at the base and fine at the point. all its feathers were so
tight and hard that they looked as though they had been varnished. they
had
 
 ___________________________
 
 been thinned out for fighting and the lines of its body, which was
like a truncated wedge, stood out plainly. from between miguel's fingers
dangled its long, bright orange legs and its slightly darker feet with
their horn nails.

"juju was bred by john r. bowes of lindale, texas," miguel said proudly.
"he's a six times winner. i give fifty dollars and a shotgun for him."

"he's a nice bird," the dwarf said grudgingly, "but looks ain't
everything."

claude took out his wallet.

"i'd like to see him fight," he said. "suppose you sell me one of your
other birds and i put it against him."

miguel thought a while and looked at earle, who told him to go ahead.

"i've 'got a bird i'll sell you for fifteen bucks," he said. the dwarf
interfered.

"let me pick the bird."

"oh, i don't ca

re," claude said, "i just want to see a fight. here's your
fifteen."

earle took the money and miguel told him to get hermano, the big red.

"that red'll go over eight pounds," he said, "while juju won't go more
than six."

earle came back carrying a large rooster that had a silver shawl. he
looked like an ordinary barnyard fowl. when the dwarf saw him, he became
indignant. "what do you call that, a goose?"

"that's one of street's butcher boys," miguel said. "i wouldn't bait a
hook with him," the dwarf said. "you don't have to bet," earle mumbled.

the dwarf eyed the bird and the bird eyed him. he turned to claude.

"let me handle him for you, mister," he said. miguel spoke quickly.

"earle'll do it. he knows the cock."

the dwarf exploded at this.

"it's a frame-up!" he yelled.

he tried to take the red, but earle held the bird high in the air out of
the little man's reach.

miguel opened the trunk and took out a small wooden box, the kind
c

ers and bits of waxed string like that
used by a shoemaker. they crowded around to watch him arm. juju. first he
wiped the short stubs on the cock's legs to make sure they were clean and
then placed a leather square over one of them so that the stub came
through the hole. he then fitted a gaff over it and fastened it with a
bit of the soft string, wrapping very carefully. he did the same to the
other leg.

when he had finished, earle started on the big red. "that's a bird with
lots of cojones," miguel said. "he's won plenty fights. he don't look
fast maybe, but he's fast all right and he packs an awful wallop."

"strictly for the cook stove, if you ask me," the dwarf said.

earle took out a pair of shears and started to lighten the red's plumage.
the dwarf watched him cut away most of the bird's tail, but when he began
to work on the breast, he caught his hand.

"leave him be!" he barked. "you'll kill him fast that way. he needs that
stuff for protection."

he turned to claude again.

"pleas

e, mister, let me handle him."

"make him buy a share in the bird," miguel said.

claude laughed and motioned for earle to give abe the bird. earle didn't
want to and looked meaningly at miguel. the dwarf began to dance with
rage.

"you're trying to cold-deck us!" he screamed.

"aw, give it to him," miguel said.

the little man tucked the bird under his left arm so that his hands were
free and began to look over the gaffs in the box. they were all the same
length, three inches, but some had more pronounced curves than the
others. he selected a pair and explained his strategy to claude.

"he's going to do most of his fighting on his back. this pair'll hit
right that way. if he could get over the other bird, i wouldn't use
them."

he got down on his knees and honed the gaffs on the cement floor unt

they were like needles.

"have we a chance?" tod asked.

"you can't ever tell," he said, shaking his extra large head. "he feels
almost like a dead bird."

after adjusting the gaffs with great care, he looked the bird over,
stretching its wings and blowing its feathers in order to see its skin.

"the comb ain't bright enough for fighting condition," he said, pinching
it, "but he looks strong. he may have been a good one once."

he held the bird in the light and looked at its head. when miguel saw him
examining its beak, he told him anxiously to quit stalling. but the dwarf
paid no attention 'and went on muttering to himself. he motioned for tod
and claude to look.

"what'd i tell you!" he said, puffing with indignation. "we've been
cold-decked."

he pointed to a hair line running across the top of the bird's beak.

"that's not a crack," miguel protested, "it's just a mark." he reached
for the bird as though to rub its beak and the bird pecked savagely at
him. this pleased the dwarf.
 
 ___________________________
 
 "we'll fight," he said, "but we won't bet."

earle was to referee. he took a piece of chalk and drew three lines in
the center of the pit, a long one in the middle and two shorter ones
parallel to it and about three feet away.

"pit your cocks," he called.

"no, bill them first," the dwarf protested.

he and miguel stood at arm's length and thrust their birds together to
anger them. juju caught the big red by the comb and held on viciously
until miguel jerked him away. the red, who had been rather apathetic,
came to life and the dwarf had trouble holding him. the two men thrust
their birds together again, and again juju caught the red's comb. the big
cock became frantic with rage and struggled to get at the smaller bird.

"we're ready," the dwarf said.

he and miguel climbed into the pit and set their birds down on the short
lines so that they faced each other. they held them by the tails and
waited for earle to give the signal to let go.

"p

bird, then set to work. he spit into its gaping beak and took the comb
between his lips and sucked the blood back into it. the red began to
regain its fury, but not its strength. its beak closed and its neck
straightened. the dwarf smoothed and shaped its plumage. he could no
nothing to help the broken wing or the dangling leg.

"pit 'em," earle said.

the dwarf insisted that the birds be put down beak to beak on the center
line, so that the red would not have to move to get at his opponent.
miguel agreed.

the red was very gallant. when abe let go of its tail, it made a great
effort to get off the ground and meet juju in the air, but it could only
thrust with one leg and fell over on its side. juju sailed above it, half
turned and came down on its back, driving in both spurs. the red twisted
free, throwing juju, and made a terrific effort to hook with its good
leg, but fell sideways again.

before juju could get into the air, the red managed to drive a hard blow
with its beak to juju's h
 
 ___________________________
 
 suddenly his cracked beak broke off, leaving only
the lower half. a large bubble of blood rose where the beak had been. the
red didn't retreat an inch, but made a great effort to get into the air
once more. using its one leg skillfully, it managed to rise six or seven
inches from the ground, not enough, however, to get its spurs into play.
juju went up with him and got well above, then drove both gaffs into the
red's breast. again one of the steel needles stuck.

"handle them," earle shouted.

miguel freed his bird and gave the other back to the dwarf. abe, moaning
softly, smoothed its feathers and licked its eyes clean, then took its
whole head in his mouth. the red was finished, however. it couldn't even
hold its neck straight. the dwarf blew away the feathers from under its
tail and pressed the lips of its vent together hard. when that didn't
seem to help, he inserted his little finger and scratched the bird's
testicles. it fluttered and made a gallant effort to straighten its neck.

"pi

t birds."

once more the red tried to rise with juju, pushing hard with its
remaining leg, but it only spun crazily. juju rose, but missed. the red
thrust weakly with its broken bill. juju went into the air again and this
time drove a gaff through one of the red's eyes into its brain. the red
fell over stone dead.

the dwarf groaned with anguish, but no one else said anything. juju
pecked at the dead bird's remaining eye.

"take off that stinking cannibal!" the dwarf screamed.

miguel laughed, then caught juju and removed its gaffs. earle did the
same for the red. he handled the dead cock gently and with respect.

tod passed the whiskey.

they were well on their way to getting drunk when homer came out to the
garage. he gave a little start when he saw the dead chicken sprawled on
the carpet. he shook hands with claude after tod introduced him, and with
abe kusich, then made a little set speech about everybody coming in for a
drink. they trooped after him. faye greeted

w man, especially if he were someone
whose affluence was obvious.

"charmed to have you," she trilled.

the dwarf laughed at her.

in a voice stiff with hauteur, she then ordered homer into the kitchen
for soda, ice and glasses.

"a swell layout," announced the dwarf, putting on the hat he had taken
off in the doorway.

he climbed into one of the big spanish chairs, using his knees and hands
to do it, and sat on the edge with his feet dangling. he looked like a
ventriloquist's dummy.

earle and miguel had remained behind to wash up. when they came in, faye
welcomed them with stilted condescension.

"how do you do, boys? the refreshments will be along in a jiffy. but
perhaps you prefer a liqueur, miguel?"

"no, mum," he said, a little startled. "i'll have what the others have."

he followed earle across the room to the couch. both of them took long,
wooden steps, as though they weren't used to being in a house. they sat
down gingerly with their backs straight, their big hats on their knees

as the word thanks. she used it to reward anyone for anything, no matter
how unimportant.

claude made the same mistake tod had often made and jumped to his feet.

"won't you sit here?" he said, waving gallantly at his chair.

she accepted by repeating the secret smile and the tongue caress. claude
bowed, but then, realizing that everyone was watching him, added a little
mock flourish to make himself less ridiculous. tod joined them, then
earle and miguel came over. claude did the courting while the others
stood by and stared at her.

"do you work in pictures, mr. estee?" she asked.

"yes. you're in pictures, of course?"

everyone was aware of the begging note in his voice, but no one smiled.
they didn't blame him. it was almost impossible to keep that note out
when talking to her. men used it just to say good morning.

"not exactly, but i hope to be," she said. "i've worked as an extra, but
i haven't had a real chance yet. i expect to get one s

when tod went back into the house, he found earle, abe kusich and claude
standing together in a tight group, watching faye dance with miguel. she
and the mexican were doing a slow tango to music from the phonograph. he
held her very tight, one of his legs thrust between hers, and they swayed
together in long spirals that broke rhythmically at the top of each curve
into a dip. all the buttons on her lounging pajamas were open and the arm
he had around her waist was inside her clothes.

tod stood watching the dancers from the doorway for a moment, then went
to a little table on which the whiskey bottle was. he poured himself a
quarter

the diminutive with perfect seriousness. "go away, please," homer
said.

"let me in for a minute. i want to explain something."

"no," homer said, "go away, please."

tod went back to the living room. the phonograph record had been changed
to a fox-trot and earle was now dancing with faye. he had both his arms
around her in a bear hug and they were stumbling all over the room,
bumping into the walls and furniture. faye, her head thrown back, was
laughing wildly. earle had both eyes shut tight.

miguel and claude were also laughing, but not the dwarf. he stood with
his fists clenched and his chin stuck out. when he couldn't stand any
more of it, he ran after the dancers to cut in. he caught earle by the
seat of his trousers.

"le'me dance," he barked.

earle turned his head, looking down at the dwarf from over his shoulder.

"git! g'wan, git!"

faye and earle had come to a halt with their arms around each other. when
the dwarf lowered his head like a goat and tried to push between them,
she r

earle sharply in the shins. earle kicked back
and his boot landed in the little man's stomach, knocking him flat on his
back. everyone laughed.

the dwarf struggled to his feet and stood with his head lowered like a
tiny ram. just as faye and earle started to dance again, he charged
between earle's legs and dug upward with both hands. earle screamed with
pain, and tried to get at him. he screamed again, then groaned and
started to sink to the floor, tearing faye's silk pajamas on his way
down.

miguel grabbed abe by the throat. the dwarf let go his hold and earle
sank to the floor. lifting the little man free, miguel shifted his grip
to his ankles and dashed him against the wall, like a man killing a
rabbit against a tree. he swung the dwarf back to slam him again, but tod
caught his arm. then claude grabbed the dwarf and together they pulled
him away from the mexican.

he was unconscious. they carried him into the kitchen and held him under
the cold water. he came to quickly and began to cu

rse. when they saw he
was all right, they went back to the living room.

miguel was helping earle over to the couch. all the tan had drained from
his face and it was covered with sweat. miguel loosened his trousers
while claude took off his necktie and opened his collar.

faye and tod watched from the side.

"look," she said, "my new pajamas are ruined."

one of the sleeves had been pulled almost off and her shoulder stuck
through it. the trousers were also torn. while he stared at her, she
undid the top of the trousers and stepped out of them. she was wearing
tight black lace drawers. tod took a step toward her and hesitated. she
threw the pajama bottoms over her arm, turned slowly

"let's go home," claude said.

"no," said the dwarf, "let's go see some girls. i'm just getting
started."

"to hell with that," snapped tod. "come on."

he pushed the dwarf toward the door.

"take your hands off, punk!" roared the little man. claude stepped
between them.

"easy there, citizen," he said.

"all right, but no shoving."

he strutted out and they followed.

earle still lay stretched on the couch. he had his eyes closed and was
holding himself below the stomach with both hands. miguel wasn't there.

abe chuckled, wagging his big head gleefully.

"i fixed that buckeroo."

out on the sidewalk he tried again to get them to go with him.

"come on, you guys--we'll have some fun."

"i'm going home," claude said.

they went with the dwarf to his car and watched him climb in behind the
wheel. he had special extensions on the clutch and brake so that he could
reach them with his tiny feet.

"come to town?"

"no, thanks," claude said politely.

"then to hell with you!"

saying anything. he didn't know what to do, so he backed out of the room
and closed the door. he was standing in the hall, trying to figure out
what to do, feeling so ashamed, when earle appeared with his boots in his
hand. he must have been sleeping in the parlor. he wanted to know what
the trouble was. "faye's sick," he said, "and i'm getting her a glass of
water." but then faye moaned again and earle heard it. he pushed open the
door. faye screamed. he could hear earl and miguel cursing each other and
fighting. he was afraid to call the police on account of faye and didn't
know what to do. faye kept on screaming. when he opened the door again,
miguel fell out with earle on top of him and both of them tearing at each
other. he ran inside the room and locked the door. she had the sheets
over her head, screaming. he could hear earle and miguel fighting in the
hall and then he couldn't hear them any more. she kept the sheets over
her head. he tried to talk to her but she w

and after a while she pulled the sheets away from her face and told him
to get out. she pulled the sheets over her face again when he answered,
so then he waited a little longer and again she told him to get out
without letting him see her face. he couldn't hear either miguel or
earle. he opened the door and looked out. they were gone. he locked the
doors and windows and went to his room and lay down on his bed. before he
knew it he fell asleep and when he woke up she was gone. all he could
find was earle's boots in the hall. he threw them out the back and this
morning they were gone.

tod went into the living room to see how homer was getting on. he was
still on the couch, but had changed his position. he had curled his big
body into a ball. his knees were dr

 fought over earle's girl, didn't they?"

"not to hear him tell it," calvin said. "he claims it was dough--claims
the mex robbed him while he was sleeping."

"the dirty, thievin' rat," said the indian, spitting.

"he claims he's all washed up with that bitch," calvin went on.

"yes, siree, that's his story, to hear him tell it" tod had enough.

"so long," he said.

"glad to meet you," said the indian.

"don't take any wooden nickels," calvin shouted after him.

tod wondered if she had gone with miguel. he thought it more likely that
she would go back to work for mrs. jenning. but either way she would come
out all right. nothing could hurt her. she was like a cork. no matter how
rough the sea got, she would go dancing over the same waves that sank
iron ships and tore away piers of reinforced concrete. he pictured her
riding a tremendous sea. wave after wave reared its ton on ton of solid
water and crashed down only to have her spin gaily away.

when he arrived at musso frank's restaurant, he
