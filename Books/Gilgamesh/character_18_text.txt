 by the fragments
in ashurbanapal's library. let us now take up the detailed analysis,
first of the pennsylvania tablet and then of the yale tablet. the
pennsylvania tablet begins with two dreams recounted by gilgamesh
to his mother, which the latter interprets as presaging the coming
of enkidu to erech. in the one, something like a heavy meteor falls
from heaven upon gilgamesh and almost crushes him. with the help of
the heroes of erech, gilgamesh carries the heavy burden to his mother
ninsun. the burden, his mother explains, symbolizes some one who,
like gilgamesh, is born in the mountains, to whom all will pay homage
and of whom gilgamesh will become enamoured with a love as strong as
that for a woman. in a second dream, gilgamesh sees some one who is
like him, who brandishes an axe, and with whom he falls in love. this
personage, the mother explains, is again enkidu.

langdon is of the opinion that these dreams are recounted to
enkidu by a woman with whom enkidu cohabits

next to the new light thrown upon the names and original character
of the two main figures of the epic, one of the chief points of
interest in the pennsylvania fragment is the proof that it furnishes
for a striking resemblance of the two heroes, gish and enkidu, to one
another. in interpreting the dream of gish, his mother. ninsun, lays
stress upon the fact that the dream portends the coming of someone
who is like gish, "born in the field and reared in the mountain"
(lines 18-19). both, therefore, are shown by this description to
have come to babylonia from a mountainous region, i.e., they are
foreigners; and in the case of enkidu we have seen that the mountain
in all probability refers to a region in the west, while the same may
also be the case with gish. the resemblance of the two heroes to one
another extends

d and published by king. [83] the
elders say to gilgamesh:


	"do not trust, o gilgamesh, in thy strength!
	be warned(?) against trusting to thy attack!
	the one who goes before will save his companion, [84]
	he who has foresight will save his friend. [85]
	let enkidu go before thee.
	he knows the roads to the cedar forest;
	he is skilled in battle and has seen fight."


gilgamesh is sufficiently impressed by this warning to invite enkidu
to accompany him on a visit to his mother, ninsun, for the purpose
of receiving her counsel. [86]

it is only after enkidu, who himself hesitates and tries to dissuade
gish, decides to accompany the latter that the elders of erech
are reconciled and encourage gish for the fray. the two in concert
proceed against huwawa. gilgamesh alone cannot carry out the plan. now
when a tale thus associates two figures in one deed, one of the
two has been added to the original tale. in the present case there
can be little doubt that enkidu, without

in fact, accuses enkidu of cowardice and boldly declares that he
will proceed even though failure stare him in the face. [88] traces
of the older view, however, in which gilgamesh is the one for whom
one fears the outcome, crop out; as, for example, in the complaint of
gilgamesh's mother to shamash that the latter has stirred the heart
of her son to take the distant way to hu(m)baba,


	"to a fight unknown to him, he advances,
	an expedition unknown to him he undertakes." [89]


ninsun evidently fears the consequences when her son informs her
of his intention and asks her counsel. the answer of shamash is not
preserved, but no doubt it was of a reassuring character, as was the
answer of the sun-god to gish's appeal and prayer as set forth in
the yale tablet. [90]

again, as a further indication that enkidu is the real conqueror of
huwawa, we find the coming contest revealed to enkidu no less than
three times in dreams, which gilgamesh interprets. [91] since the

we have in the assyrian version i, 6, 23-25, an elaboration of line
30 in the pennsylvania tablet and taken over from the recital of
the first dream. through the assyrian version i, 6, 31-32, we can
restore the closing lines of column i of the pennsylvania tablet,
while with line 33 = line 45 of the pennsylvania tablet, the parallel
between the two versions comes to an end. lines 34-43 of the assyrian
version (bringing tablet i to a close) [135] represent an elaboration
of the speech of ninsun, followed by a further address of gilgamesh
to his mother, and by the determination of gilgamesh to seek out
enkidu. [136] nothing of this sort appears to have been included in
the old babylonian version.our text proceeds with the scene between
enkidu and the woman, in which the latter by her charms and her appeal
endeavors to lead enkidu away from his life with the animals. from
the abrupt manner in which the scene is introduced in line 43 of the
pennsylvania tablet, it is evident that

commentary on the pennsylvania tablet.


line 1. the verb _tibû_ with _pasâru_ expresses the aim of gish to
secure an interpretation for his dream. this disposes of langdon's
note 1 on page 211 of his edition, in which he also erroneously speaks
of our text as "late." _pasâru_ is not a variant of _zakâru_. both
verbs occur

is anger," and not
_us-sa-sú_, "his javelin," as langdon does, which gives no sense.

line 231. langdon's note is erroneous. he again misses the point. the
stem of the verb here as in line 230 (_i-ni-ih_) is the common _nâhu_,
used so constantly in connection with _pasâhu_, to designate the
cessation of anger.

line 234. _istên_ applied to gish designates him of course as "unique,"
not as "an ordinary man," as langdon supposes.

line 236. on this title "wild cow of the stall" for ninsun, see poebel
in _olz_ 1914, page 6, to whom we owe the correct view regarding the
name of gilgamesh's mother.

line 238. _mu-ti_ here cannot mean "husband," but "man" in general. see
above note to line 107. langdon's strange misreading _ri-es-su_ for
_ri-es-ka_ ("thy head") leads him again to miss the point, namely
that enkidu comforts his rival by telling him that he is destined for
a career above that of the ordinary man. he is to be more than a mere
prize fighter; he is to be a king,

namely, because he knows the country in which huwawa dwells (lines
252-253), was supplemented by describing enkidu also as being more
experienced in battle than gilgamesh.

line 254. i am unable to furnish a satisfactory rendering for this
line, owing to the uncertainty of the word at the end. can it be
"his household," from the stem which in hebrew gives us misepohoh
"family?"

line 255. is paralleled by col. 1, 4, of king's new fragment. the
episode of gish and enkidu proceeding to ninsun, the mother of gish,
to obtain her counsel, which follows in king's fragment, appears to
have been omitted in the old babylonian version. such an elaboration of
the tale is exactly what we should expect as it passed down the ages.

line 257. our text shows that _irnittu_ (lines 257, 264, 265) means
primarily "endeavor," and then success in one's endeavor, or "triumph."

lines 266-270. do not appear to refer to rites performed after a
victory, as might at a first glance appear, but mere
