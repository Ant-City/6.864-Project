Bassanio - 
                A
gentleman of Venice, and a kinsman and dear friend to Antonio. Bassanio's
love for the wealthy Portia leads him to borrow money from Shylock
with Antonio as his guarantor. An ineffectual businessman, Bassanio proves
himself a worthy suitor, correctly identifying the casket that contains
Portia's portrait.
