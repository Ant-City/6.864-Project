  to persecute so brave, so just a man;
  involv'd his anxious life in endless cares,
  expos'd to wants, and hurried into wars!
  can heav'nly minds such high resentment show,
  or exercise their spite in human woe?

  against the tiber's mouth, but far away,
  an ancient town was seated on the sea;
  a tyrian colony; the people made
  stout for the war, and studious of their trade:
  carthage the name; belov'd by juno more
  than her own argos, or the samian shore.
  here stood her chariot; here, if heav'n were kind,
  the seat of awful empire she design'd.
  yet she had heard an ancient rumor fly,
  (long cited by the people of the sky,)
  that times to come should see the trojan race
  her carthage ruin, and her tow'rs deface;
  nor thus confin'd, the yoke of sov'reign sway
  should on the necks of all the nations lay.
  she ponder'd this, and fear'd it was in fate;
  nor could forget the war she wag'd of

  transfix'd, and naked, on a rock she bound.
  but i, who walk in awful state above,

  against the thin remains of ruin'd troy!
  what nations now to juno's pow'r will pray,
  or off'rings on my slighted altars lay?"

  thus rag'd the goddess; and, with fury fraught.
  the restless regions of the storms she sought,
  where, in a spacious cave of living stone,
  the tyrant aeolus, from his airy throne,
  with pow'r imperial curbs the struggling winds,
  and sounding tempests in dark prisons binds.

  thick set with trees, a venerable wood.
  the tyrians, landing near this holy ground,
  and digging here, a prosp'rous omen found:
  from under earth a courser's head they drew,

  should bring the presents, in her nephew's stead,
  and in eliza's veins the gentle poison shed:
  for much she fear'd the tyrians, double-tongued,
  and knew the town to juno's care belong'd.
  these thoughts by night her golden slumbers broke,
  and thus alarm'd, to winged love she spoke:
  "my son, my strength, whose mighty pow'r alone
  controls the thund'rer on his awful throne,
  to thee thy much-afflicted mother flies,
  and on thy succor and thy faith relies.

  the bowl that belus us'd, and all the tyrian line.
  then, silence thro' the hall proclaim'd, she spoke:
  "o hospitable jove! we thus invoke,
  with solemn rites, thy sacred name and pow'r;

  so may the trojan and the tyrian line

  and fierce numidians there your frontiers bound;

  while these affairs in distant places pass'd,
  the various iris juno sends with haste,
  to find bold turnus, who, with anxious thought,
  the secret shade of his great grandsire sought.
  retir'd alone she found the daring man,
  and op'd her rosy lips, and thus began:
  "what none of all the gods could grant thy vows,
  that, turnus, this auspicious day bestows.
  aeneas, gone to seek th' arcadian prince,

  and, short of succors there, employs his pains

  to whom, with count'nance calm, and soul sedate,
  thus turnus: "then begin, and try thy fate:
  my message to the ghost of priam bear;
  tell him a new achilles sent thee there."

  a lance of tough ground ash the trojan threw,
  rough in the rind, and knotted as it grew:
  with his full force he whirl'd it first around;
  but the soft yielding air receiv'd the wound:
  imperial juno turn'd the course before,
  and fix'd the wand'ring weapon in the door.

  "but hope not thou," said turnus, "when i strike,
  to shun thy fate: our force is not alike,
  nor thy steel temper'd by the lemnian god."
  then rising, on his utmost stretch he stood,
  and aim'd from high: the full descending blow
  cleaves the broad front and beardless cheeks in two.
  down sinks the giant with a thund'ring sound:
  his pond'rous limbs oppress the trembling ground;
  blood, brains, and foam gush fro

  grins horrible, retires, and turns again;
  threats his distended paws, and shakes his mane;
  he loses while in vain he presses on,
  nor will his courage let him dare to run:
  so turnus fares, and, unresolved of flight,
  moves tardy back, and just recedes from fight.
  yet twice, inrag'd, the combat he renews,
  twice breaks, and twice his broken foes pursues.
  but now they swarm, and, with fresh troops supplied,
  come rolling on, and rush from ev'ry side:
  nor juno, who sustain'd his arms before,
  dares with new strength suffice th' exhausted store;
  for jove, with sour commands, sent iris down,
  to force th' invader from the frighted town.

  with labor spent, no longer can he wield
  the heavy fanchion, or sustain the shield,
  o'erwhelm'd with darts, which from afar they fling:
  the weapons round his hollow temples ring;
  his golden helm gives way, with stony blows

  in whispers first their tender voices try,
  then issue on the main with bellowing rage,
  and storms to trembling mariners presage.

  then thus to both replied th' imperial god,
  who shakes heav'n's axles with his awful nod.

  unknown to friends, or foes, or conscious fame,
  lest she should follow, and my flight proclaim."

  thus turnus rav'd, and various fates revolv'd:
  the choice was doubtful, but the death resolv'd.
  and now the sword, and now the sea took place,
  that to revenge, and this to purge disgrace.
  sometimes he thought to swim the stormy main,
  by stretch of arms the distant shore to gain.
  thrice he the sword assay'd, and thrice the flood;
  but juno, mov'd with pity, both withstood.
  and thrice repress'd his rage; strong gales supplied,
  and push'd the vessel o'er the swelling tide.
  at length she lands him on his native shores,
  and to his father's longing arms restores.

  meantime, by jove's impulse, mezentius arm'd,
  succeeding turnus, with his ardor warm'd
  his fainting friends, reproach'd their shameful flight,
  repell'd the victors, and renew'd the fight.
  against their king the tuscan troops conspire;
  such is their hate,

  but the same fate the victor underwent,
  slain by nealces' hand, well-skill'd to throw
  the flying dart, and draw the far-deceiving bow.

  thus equal deaths are dealt with equal chance;
  by turns they quit their ground, by turns advance:
  victors and vanquish'd, in the various field,
  nor wholly overcome, nor wholly yield.
  the gods from heav'n survey the fatal strife,
  and mourn the miseries of human life.
  above the rest, two goddesses appear
  concern'd for each: here venus, juno there.
  amidst the crowd, infernal ate shakes
  her scourge aloft, and crest of hissing snakes.

  once more the proud mezentius, with disdain,
  brandish'd his spear, and rush'd into the plain,
  where tow'ring in the midmost rank she stood,
  like tall orion stalking o'er the flood.
  (when with his brawny breast he cuts the waves,
  his shoulders scarce the topmost billow laves),
  or like a mountain ash, whose roots are spread,
  deep fix'd in earth; in clouds he hides his head.

  t' assert her offspring with a greater deed,
  from the tough root the ling'ring weapon freed.

  once more erect, the rival chiefs advance:
  one trusts the sword, and one the pointed lance;
  and both resolv'd alike to try their fatal chance.

  meantime imperial jove to juno spoke,
  who from a shining cloud beheld the shock:
  "what new arrest, o queen of heav'n, is sent
  to stop the fates now lab'ring in th' event?
  what farther hopes are left thee to pursue?
  divine aeneas, (and thou know'st it too,)

  what more attempts for turnus can be made,
  that thus thou ling'rest in this lonely shade?

  and, driv'n ashore, with hostile arms oppress;
  deform the royal house; and, from the side
  of the just bridegroom, tear the plighted bride:

  and, with dejected eyes, this answer juno made:
  "because your dread decree too well i knew,
  from turnus and from earth unwilling i withdrew.
  else should you not behold me here, alone,
  involv'd in empty clouds, my friends bemoan,
  but, girt with vengeful flames, in open sight

  't is true, juturna mingled in the strife

  juno consents, well pleas'd that her desires
  had found success, and from the cloud retires.

  the peace thus made, the thund'rer next prepares
  to force the wat'ry goddess from the wars.
  deep in the dismal regions void of light,
  three daughters at a birth were born to night:
  these their brown mother, brooding on her care,
