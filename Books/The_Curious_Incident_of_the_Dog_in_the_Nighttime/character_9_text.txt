 
this is a murder mystery novel. 
 
siobhan  said  that  i  should  write  something  i  would  want  to  read  myself.  mostly  i  read  books  about 
science and maths. i do not like proper novels. in proper novels people say things like, "i am veined with 
iron, with silver and with streaks of common mud. i cannot contract into the firm fist which those clench 
who  do  not  depend  on  stimulus."  1  what  does  this  mean?  i  do  not  know.  nor  does  father.  nor  does 
siobhan or mr. jeavons. i have asked them. 
 
siobhan has long blond hair and wears glasses which are made of green plastic. and mr. jeavons smells 
of soap and wears brown shoes that have approximately 60 tiny circular holes in each of them. 
 
but i do like murder mystery novels. so i am writing a murder mystery novel. 
 
in  a  murder  mystery  novel  someone  has  to  work  out  who  the  murderer  is  and  then  catch  them.  it  is  a 
puzzle. if it is a good puzzle you can sometimes work out the answer before

i said i would make her a get well card, because that is what you do for people when they are in hospital. 
 
father said he would take it in the next day.

in the bus on the way to school next morning we passed 4 red cars in a row, which meant that it was a 
good day, so i decided not to be sad about wellington. 
 
mr. jeavons, the psychologist at the school, once asked me why 4 red cars in a row made it a good day, 
and 3 red cars in a row made it a quite good day, and 5 red cars in a row made it a super good day, 
and why 4 yellow cars in a row made it a black day, which is a day when i don't speak to anyone and sit 
on  my own reading books and don't eat  my lunch and take no risks. he said that i was clearly a very 
logical person, so he was surprised that i should think like this because it wasn't very logical.

ining and it made them feel sad, but the only difference 
was the weather and if they worked in an office the weather didn't have anything to do with whether they 
had a good day or a bad day. 
 
i said that when father got up in the morning he always put his trousers on before he put his socks on and 
it wasn't logical but he always did it that way, because he liked things in a nice order, too. also whenever 
he went upstairs he went up two at a time, always starting with his right foot. 
 
mr. jeavons said that i was a very clever boy. 
 
i said that i wasn't clever. i was just noticing how things were, and that wasn't clever. that was just being 
observant.  being  clever  was  when  you  looked  at  how  things  were  and  used  the  evidence  to  work  out 
something new. like the universe expanding, or who committed a murder. or if you see someone's name 
and you give each letter a value from 1 to 26 (a = 1, b = 2, etc.) and you add the numbers up in your head 
and you find that it makes

 a prime number, like jesus christ (151), or scooby-doo (113), or sherlock 
holmes (163), or doctor watson (167). 
 
mr. jeavons asked me whether this made me feel safe, having things always in a nice order, and i said it 
did. 
 
then he asked if i didn't like things changing. and i said i wouldn't mind things changing if i became an 
astronaut, for example, which is one of the biggest changes you can imagine, apart from becoming a girl 
or dying. 
 
he asked whether i wanted to become an astronaut and i said i did. 
 
he said that it was very difficult to become an astronaut. i said that i knew. you had to become an of

she said, "if you want to talk about this you can come and see me anytime you want. you only have 
to knock on my door." 
 
and i said, "ok." 
 
and she said, "christopher?" 
 
and i said, "what?" 
 
and she said, "you won't tell your father about this conversation, will you?" 
 
and i said, "no. i promised." 
 
and she said, "you go on home. and remember what i said. anytime." 

 
then i went home.

mr. jeavons said that i liked maths because it was safe. he said i liked maths because it meant solving 
problems,  and  these  problems  were  difficult  and  interesting  but  there  was  always  a  straightforward 
answer  at  the  end.  and  what  he  meant  was  that  maths  wasn't  like  life  because  in  life  there  are  no 
straightforward answers at the end. i know he meant this because this is what he said. 
 
this is because mr. jeavons doesn't understand numbers. 
 
here is a famous story cal

= p(cy)·p (hz ¦ cy) + p(cz)·p(hy ¦ cz) 
= (1/3 · 1) + (1/3 · 1) = 2/3 
 

the second way you can work it out is by making a picture of all the possible outcomes like this 
 

 

 
 
so if you change, 2 times out of 3 you get a car. and if you stick, you only get a car 1 time out of 3. 
 
and this shows that intuition can sometimes get things wrong. and intuition is what people use in life to 
make decisions. but logic can help you work out the right answer. 
 
it  also  shows  that  mr.  jeavons  was  wrong  and  numbers  are  sometimes  very  complicated  and  not  very 
straightforward at all. and that is why i like the monty hall problem.

when  i  got  home  rhodri  was  there.  rhodri  is  the  man  who  works  for  father,  helping  him  do  heating 
maintenance and boiler repair. and he sometimes comes round to the house in the evening to drink beer 
with father and watch the television and have

scriptions of things. i said that 
i could take photographs and put them in the book. but she said the idea of a book was to describe things 
using words so that people could read them and make a picture in their own head. 
 
and she said it was best to describe things that were interesting or different. 
 
she also said that i should describe people in the story by mentioning one or two details about them so 
that people could make a picture of them in their head. which is why i wrote about mr. jeavons's shoes 
with all the holes in them and the policeman who looked as if he had two mice in his nose and the thing 
rhodri smelled of but i didn't know the name for. 
 
so i decided to do a description of the garden. but the garden wasn't very interesting or different. it was 
just a garden, with grass and a shed and a clothesline. but the sky was interesting and different because 
usually skies look boring because they are all blue or all gray or all covered in one pattern of clouds and 
they  d
