d diligently for some moments
longer.

â€œmarilla,â€ she demanded presently, â€œdo you think that i shall ever have
a bosom friend in avonlea?â€

â€œa--a what kind of friend?â€

â€œa bosom friend--an intimate friend, you know--a really kindred spirit
to whom i can confide my inmost soul. iâ€™ve dreamed of meeting her all
my life. i never really supposed i would, but so many of my loveliest
dreams have come true all at once that perhaps this one will, too. do
you think itâ€™s possible?â€

â€œdiana barry lives over at orchard slope and sheâ€™s about your age. sheâ€™s
a very nice little girl, and perhaps she will be a playmate for you when
she comes home. sheâ€™s visiting her aunt over at carmody just now. youâ€™ll
have to be careful how you behave yourself, though. mrs. barry is a
very particular woman. she wonâ€™t let diana play with any little girl who
isnâ€™t nice and good.â€

anne looked at marilla through the apple blossoms, her eyes aglow with
interest.

â€œwhat is diana like? her hair i

 me back to the asylum. that would
be terrible; i donâ€™t think i could endure it; most likely i would go
into consumption; iâ€™m so thin as it is, you see. but that would be
better than being a trial to you.â€

â€œnonsense,â€ said marilla, vexed at herself for having made the child
cry. â€œi donâ€™t want to send you back to the asylum, iâ€™m sure. all i want
is that you should behave like other little girls and not make yourself
ridiculous. donâ€™t cry any more. iâ€™ve got some news for you. diana barry
came home this afternoon. iâ€™m going up to see if i can borrow a skirt
pattern from mrs. barry, and if you like you can come with me and get
acquainted with diana.â€

anne rose to her feet, with clasped hands, the tears still glistening on
her cheeks; the dish towel she had been hemming slipped unheeded to the
floor.

â€œoh, marilla, iâ€™m frightened--now that it has come iâ€™m actually
frightened. what if she shouldnâ€™t like me! it would be the most tragical
disappointment of my life.â€

 two kinds, you know.â€

â€œi never heard of but one kind,â€ said diana doubtfully.

â€œthere really is another. oh, it isnâ€™t wicked at all. it just means
vowing and promising solemnly.â€

â€œwell, i donâ€™t mind doing that,â€ agreed diana, relieved. â€œhow do you do
it?â€

â€œwe must join hands--so,â€ said anne gravely. â€œit ought to be over
running water. weâ€™ll just imagine this path is running water. iâ€™ll
repeat the oath first. i solemnly swear to be faithful to my bosom
friend, diana barry, as long as the sun and moon shall endure. now you
say it and put my name in.â€

diana repeated the â€œoathâ€ with a laugh fore and aft. then she said:

â€œyouâ€™re a queer girl, anne. i heard before that you were queer. but i
believe iâ€™m going to like you real well.â€

when marilla and anne went home diana went with them as far as the log
bridge. the two little girls walked with their arms about each other.
at the brook they parted with many promises to spend the next afternoon
together.

 after dinner hour, met
with a more favorable reception. anne was graciously pleased to accept
it and rewarded the donor with a smile which exalted that infatuated
youth straightway into the seventh heaven of delight and caused him to
make such fearful errors in his dictation that mr. phillips kept him in
after school to rewrite it.

but as,

  the caesarâ€™s pageant shorn of brutusâ€™ bust
  did but of romeâ€™s best son remind her more,

so the marked absence of any tribute or recognition from diana barry who
was sitting with gertie pye embittered anneâ€™s little triumph.

â€œdiana might just have smiled at me once, i think,â€ she mourned to
marilla that night. but the next morning a note most fearfully and
wonderfully twisted and folded, and a small parcel were passed across to
anne.

dear anne (ran the former)


mother says iâ€™m not to play with you or talk to you even in school. it
isnâ€™t my fault and donâ€™t be cross at me, because i love you as much
as ever. i miss you awfully to tell al

gertie pye one bit. i made you one of the new bookmarkers out of red
tissue paper. they are awfully fashionable now and only three girls in
school know how to make them. when you look at it remember

your true friend

diana barry.


anne read the note, kissed the bookmark, and dispatched a prompt reply
back to the other side of the school.


my own darling diana:--

of course i am not cross at you because you have to obey your mother.
our spirits can commune. i shall keep your lovely present forever.
minnie andrews is a very nice little girl--although she has no
imagination--but after having been dianaâ€™s busum friend i cannot be
minnieâ€™s. please excuse mistakes because my spelling isnâ€™t very good
yet, although muc

d to live through more than two weeks, as it happened. almost a
month having elapsed since the liniment cake episode, it was high time
for her to get into fresh trouble of some sort, little mistakes, such as
absentmindedly emptying a pan of skim milk into a basket of yarn balls
in the pantry instead of into the pigsâ€™ bucket, and walking clean over
the edge of the log bridge into the brook while wrapped in imaginative
reverie, not really being worth counting.

a week after the tea at the manse diana barry gave a party.

â€œsmall and select,â€ anne assured marilla. â€œjust the girls in our class.â€

they had a very good time and nothing untoward happened until after tea,
when they found themselves in the barry garden, a little tired of all
their games and ripe for any enticing form of mischief which might
present itself. this presently took the form of â€œdaring.â€

daring was the fashionable amusement among the avonlea small fry just
then. it had begun among the boys, but soon spread to the g

id not look at all like the sleeves the
other girls wore. he recalled the cluster of little girls he had seen
around her that evening--all gay in waists of red and blue and pink
and white--and he wondered why marilla always kept her so plainly and
soberly gowned.

of course, it must be all right. marilla knew best and marilla was
bringing her up. probably some wise, inscrutable motive was to be served
thereby. but surely it would do no harm to let the child have one pretty
dress--something like diana barry always wore. matthew decided that
he would give her one; that surely could not be objected to as an
unwarranted putting in of his oar. christmas was only a fortnight off.
a nice new dress would be the very thing for a present. matthew, with a
sigh of satisfaction, put away his pipe and went to bed, while marilla
opened all the doors and aired the house.

the very next evening matthew betook himself to carmody to buy the
dress, determined to get the worst over and have done with it. it would

 â€œbecause i have a purpose in life. mr. allan says everybody
should have a purpose in life and pursue it faithfully. only he says
we must first make sure that it is a worthy purpose. i would call it a
worthy purpose to want to be a teacher like miss stacy, wouldnâ€™t you,
marilla? i think itâ€™s a very noble profession.â€

the queenâ€™s class was organized in due time. gilbert blythe, anne
shirley, ruby gillis, jane andrews, josie pye, charlie sloane, and moody
spurgeon macpherson joined it. diana barry did not, as her parents
did not intend to send her to queenâ€™s. this seemed nothing short of a
calamity to anne. never, since the night on which minnie may had had the
croup, had she and diana been separated in anything. on the evening when
the queenâ€™s class first remained in school for the extra lessons and
anne saw diana go slowly out with the others, to walk home alone through
the birch path and violet vale, it was all the former could do to keep
her seat and refrain from rushing impulsiv
