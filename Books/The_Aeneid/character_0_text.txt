  first, good achates, with repeated strokes
  of clashing flints, their hidden fire provokes:
  short flame succeeds; a bed of wither'd leaves
  the dying sparkles in their fall receives:
  caught into life, in fiery fumes they rise,
  and, fed with stronger food, invade the skies.
  the trojans, dropping wet, or stand around
  the cheerful blaze, or lie along the ground:
  some dry their corn, infected with the brine,
  then grind with marbles, and prepare to dine.
  aeneas climbs the mountain's airy brow,
  and takes a prospect of the seas below,
  if capys thence, or antheus he could spy,
  or see the streamers of caicus fly.
  no vessels were in view; but, on the plain,
  three beamy stags command a lordly train
  of branching heads: the more ignoble throng
  attend their stately steps, and slowly graze along.

  he took the quiver and the trusty bow

  some strip the skin; some portion out the spoil;
  the limbs, yet trembling, in the caldrons boil;
  some on the fire the reeking entrails broil.
  stretch'd on the grassy turf, at ease they dine,
  restore their strength with meat, and cheer their souls with
  wine.
  their hunger thus appeas'd, their care attends
  the doubtful fortune of their absent friends:
  alternate hopes and fears their minds possess,
  whether to deem 'em dead, or in distress.
  above the rest, aeneas mourns the fate
  of brave orontes, and th' uncertain state
  of gyas, lycus, and of amycus.
  the day, but not their sorrows, ended thus.

  when, from aloft, almighty jove surveys
  earth, air, and shores, and navigable seas,
  at length on libyan realms he fix'd his eyes-
  whom, pond'ring thus on human miseries,
  when venus saw, she with a lowly look,
  not free from tears, her heav'nly sire bespoke:

  and is it thus that jove his plighted faith regards?"

  to whom the father of th' immortal race,
  smiling with that serene indulgent face,
  with which he drives the clouds and clears the skies,
  first gave a holy kiss; then thus replies:

  "daughter, dismiss thy fears; to thy desire
  the fates of thine are fix'd, and stand entire.
  thou shalt behold thy wish'd lavinian walls;
  and, ripe for heav'n, when fate aeneas calls,
  then shalt thou bear him up, sublime, to me:
  no councils have revers'd my firm decree.
  and, lest new fears disturb thy happy state,

  shall tame fierce nations in the bloody field,

  down from the steep of heav'n cyllenius flies,
  and cleaves with all his wings the yielding skies.
  soon on the libyan shore descends the god,
  performs his message, and displays his rod:
  the surly murmurs of the people cease;
  and, as the fates requir'd, they give the peace:
  the queen herself suspends the rigid laws,
  the trojans pities, and protects their cause.

  meantime, in shades of night aeneas lies:
  care seiz'd his soul, and sleep forsook his eyes.
  but, when the sun restor'd the cheerful day,
  he rose, the coast and country to survey,
  anxious and eager to discover more.
  it look'd a wild uncultivated shore;
  but, whether humankind, or beasts alone
  possess'd the new-found region, was unknown.

  to whom, with sorrow streaming from his eyes,
  and deeply sighing, thus her son replies:
  "could you with patience hear, or i relate,

  thro' such a train of woes if i should run,
  the day would sooner than the tale be done!
  from ancient troy, by force expell'd, we came-

  the lazy drones from the laborious hive:
  with envy stung, they view each other's deeds;
  the fragrant work with diligence proceeds.
  "thrice happy you, whose walls already rise!"
  aeneas said, and view'd, with lifted eyes,
  their lofty tow'rs; then, entiring at the gate,

  their labor to her future sway she speeds,

  and sumptuous feasts are made in splendid halls:
  on tyrian carpets, richly wrought, they dine;
  with loads of massy plate the sideboards shine,
  and antique vases, all of gold emboss'd
  (the gold itself inferior to the cost),
  of curious work, where on the sides were seen
  the fights and figures of illustrious men,
  from their first founder to the present queen.

  the good aeneas, paternal care
  iulus' absence could no longer bear,
  dispatch'd achates to the ships in haste,
  to give a glad relation of the past,
  and, fraught with precious gifts, to bring the boy,
  snatch'd from the ruins of unhappy troy:
  a robe of tissue, stiff with golden wire;
  an upper vest, once helen's rich attire,

  the guileful god about the hero long,
  with children's play, and false embraces, hung;
  then sought the queen: she took him to her arms
  with greedy pleasure, and devour'd his charms.
  unhappy dido little thought what guest,
  how dire a god, she drew so near her breast;
  but he, not mindless of his mother's pray'r,
  works in the pliant bosom of the fair,
  and molds her heart anew, and blots her former care.
  the dead is to the living love resign'd;
  and all aeneas enters in her mind.

  now, when the rage of hunger was appeas'd,
  the meat remov'd, and ev'ry guest was pleas'd,
  the golden bowls with sparkling wine are crown'd,
  and thro' the palace cheerful cries resound.
  from gilded roofs depending lamps display
  nocturnal beams, that emulate the day.
  a golden bowl, that shone with gems divine,
  the queen commanded to be crown'd with wine:

  this rising city, which my hands erect:
  but shall celestial discord never cease?
  't is better ended in a lasting peace.

  then venus, who her hidden fraud descried,
  which would the scepter of the world misguide
  to libyan shores, thus artfully replied:
  "who, but a fool, would wars with juno choose,
  and such alliance and such gifts refuse,
  if fortune with our joint desires comply?

  lest he forbid, with absolute command,

  "mine," said imperial juno, "be the care;
  time urges, now, to perfect this affair:
  attend my counsel, and the secret share.
  when next the sun his rising light displays,
  and gilds the world below with purple rays,

  shall to the shady woods, for sylvan game, resort.
  there, while the huntsmen pitch their toils around,
  and cheerful horns from side to side resound,
  a pitchy cloud shall cover all the plain
  with hail, and thunder, and tempestuous rain;
  the fearful train shall take their speedy flight,

  the queen at length appears; on either hand
  the brawny guards in martial order stand.
  a flow'r'd simar with golden fringe she wore,
  and at her back a golden quiver bore;
  her flowing hair a golden caul restrains,
  a golden clasp the tyrian robe sustains.
  then young ascanius, with a sprightly grace,
  leads on the trojan youth to view the chase.
  but far above the rest in beauty shines
  the great aeneas, the troop he joins;
  like fair apollo, when he leaves the frost
  of wint'ry xanthus, and the lycian coast,
  when to his native delos he resorts,
  ordains the dances, and renews the sports;
  where painted scythians, mix'd with cretan bands,
  before the joyful altars join their hands:
  himself, on cynthus walking, sees below
  the merry madness of the sacred show.

  by jove's command; nor suffer'd love to rise,
  tho' heaving in his heart; and thus at length replies:

  her loathing eyes, and shuns the sight of day.
  amaz'd he stood, revolving in his mind
  what speech to frame, and what excuse to find.
  her fearful maids their fainting mistress led,
  and softly laid her on her ivory bed.

  but good aeneas, tho' he much desir'd
  to give that pity which her grief requir'd;
  tho' much he mourn'd, and labor'd with his love,
  resolv'd at length, obeys the will of jove;
  reviews his forces: they with early care
  unmoor their vessels, and for sea prepare.

  hourly 't is heard, when with a boding note
  the solitary screech owl strains her throat,
  and, on a chimney's top, or turret's height,
  with songs obscene disturbs the silence of the night.
  besides, old prophecies augment her fears;
  and stern aeneas in her dreams appears,
  disdainful as by day: she seems, alone,
  to wander in her sleep, thro' ways unknown,
  guideless and dark; or, in a desart plain,
  to seek her subjects, and to seek in vain:
  like pentheus, when, distracted with his fear,
  he saw two suns, and double thebes, appear;
  or mad orestes, when his mother's ghost

  aeneas then replied: "too sure i find

  now shift your sails; what place can please me more
  than what you promise, the sicilian shore,
  whose hallow'd earth anchises' bones contains,
  and where a prince of trojan lineage reigns?"
  the course resolv'd, before the western wind
  they scud amain, and make the port assign'd.

  his sire crinisus, a sicilian flood.
  he welcomes his returning friends ashore

  the flying stars, and light restor'd the day,
  aeneas call'd the trojan troops around,

  he said, and first his brows with myrtle bound.
  then helymus, by his example led,
  and old acestes, each adorn'd his head;
  thus young ascanius, with a sprightly grace,
  his temples tied, and all the trojan race.
   aeneas then advanc'd amidst the train,
  by thousands follow'd thro' the flow'ry plain,
  to great anchises' tomb; which when he found,
  he pour'd to bacchus, on the hallow'd ground,
  two bowls of sparkling wine, of milk two more,
  and two (from offer'd bulls) of purple gore,
  with roses then the sepulcher he strow'd
  and thus his father's ghost bespoke aloud:

  breathless he seems, yet eager to pursue;
  when from aloft descends, in open view,
  the bird of jove, and, sousing on his prey,
  with crooked talons bears the boy away.
  in vain, with lifted hands and gazing eyes,
  his guards behold him soaring thro' the skies,
  and dogs pursue his flight with imitated cries.

  mnestheus the second victor was declar'd;
  and, summon'd there, the second prize he shard.
  a coat of mail, brave demoleus bore,
  more brave aeneas from his shoulders tore,
  in single combat on the trojan shore:
  this was ordain'd for mnestheus to possess;
  in war for his defense, for ornament in peace.
  rich was the gift, and glorious to behold,
  but yet so pond'rous with its plates of gold,
  that scarce two servants could the weight sustain;
  yet, loaded thus, demoleus o'er the plain
  pursued and lightly seiz'd the trojan train.

  and these i wielded while my blood was warm,

  ere age unstrung my nerves, or time o'ersnow'd my head.
  but if the challenger these arms refuse,
  and cannot wield their weight, or dare not use;
  if great aeneas and acestes join

  and let him leave to fear, since i resign my right."

  this said, entellus for the strife prepares;
  stripp'd of his quilted coat, his body bares;
  compos'd of mighty bones and brawn he stands,
  a goodly tow'ring object on the sands.

  the gauntlet fight thus ended, from the shore
  his faithful friends unhappy dares bore:
  his mouth and nostrils pour'd a purple flood,
  and pounded teeth came rushing with his blood.
  faintly he stagger'd thro' the hissing throng,
  and hung his head, and trail'd his legs along.
  the sword and casque are carried by his train;
  but with his foe the palm and ox remain.

  the champion, then, before aeneas came,
  proud of his prize, but prouder of his fame:
  "o goddess-born, and you, dardanian host,
  mark with attention, and forgive my boast;
  learn what i was, by what remains; and know
  from what impending fate you sav'd my foe."
  sternly he spoke, and then confronts the bull;
  and, on his ample forehead aiming full,
  the deadly stroke, descending, pierc'd the skull.
  down drops the beast, nor needs a second wound,
  but sprawls in pangs of death, and spurns the ground.

  the mast sergesthus' shatter'd galley bore
  with his own hands he raises on the shore.
  a flutt'ring dove upon the top they tie,
  the living mark at which their arrows fly.
  the rival archers in a line advance,
  their turn of shooting to receive from chance.

  nor could his frighted friends reclaim his haste.
  soon as the royal youth appear'd in view,
  he sent his voice before him as he flew:
  "what madness moves you, matrons, to destroy
  the last remainders of unhappy troy!
  not hostile fleets, but your own hopes, you burn,
  and on your friends your fatal fury turn.
  behold your own ascanius!" while he said,
  he drew his glitt'ring helmet from his head,
  in which the youths to sportful arms he led.

  then from the south arose a gentle breeze
  that curl'd the smoothness of the glassy seas;
  the rising winds a ruffling gale afford,
  and call the merry mariners aboard.

  now loud laments along the shores resound,
  of parting friends in close embraces bound.
  the trembling women, the degenerate train,
  who shunn'd the frightful dangers of the main,
  ev'n those desire to sail, and take their share
  of the rough passage and the promis'd war:
  whom good aeneas cheers, and recommends
  to their new master's care his fearful friends.
  on eryx's altars three fat calves he lays;
  a lamb new-fallen to the stormy seas;
  then slips his haulsers, and his anchors weighs.
  high on the deck the godlike hero stands,
  with olive crown'd, a charger in his hands;
  then cast the reeking entrails in the brine,
  and pour'd the sacrifice of purple wine.

  that mix'd the mounting billows with the clouds;

  while these affairs in distant places pass'd,
  the various iris juno sends with haste,
  to find bold turnus, who, with anxious thought,
  the secret shade of his great grandsire sought.
  retir'd alone she found the daring man,
  and op'd her rosy lips, and thus began:
  "what none of all the gods could grant thy vows,
  that, turnus, this auspicious day bestows.
  aeneas, gone to seek th' arcadian prince,
  has left the trojan camp without defense;
  and, short of succors there, employs his pains
  in parts remote to raise the tuscan swains.
  now snatch an hour that favors thy designs;
  unite thy forces, and attack their lines."
  this said, on equal wings she pois'd her weight,
  and form'd a radiant rainbow in her flight.

  the daunian hero lifts his hands eyes,
  and thus invokes the goddess as she flies:
  "iris, the grace of heav'n, what pow'r divine

  now, fill'd with fear, on their behalf i come;
  let neither winds o'erset, nor waves intomb
  the floating forests of the sacred pine;
  but let it be their safety to be mine."
  then thus replied her awful son, who rolls
  the radiant stars, and heav'n and earth controls:
  "how dare you, mother, endless date demand
  for vessels molded by a mortal hand?
  what then is fate? shall bold aeneas ride,
  of safety certain, on th' uncertain tide?
  yet, what i can, i grant; when, wafted o'er,
  the chief is landed on the latian shore,
  whatever ships escape the raging storms,
  at my command shall change their fading forms
  to nymphs divine, and plow the wat'ry way,
  like dotis and the daughters of the sea."
  to seal his sacred vow, by styx he swore,

  how lofty turnus vaunts amidst his train,

  the town is fill'd with slaughter, and o'erfloats,

  their passage, while they labor to the land,

  scarce had he reach'd the prow: saturnia's hand
  the haulsers cuts, and shoots the ship from land.

  too late young turnus the delusion found,

  the pious prince beheld young lausus dead,
  he griev'd; he wept; the sight an image brought
  of his own filial love, a sadly pleasing thought:
  then stretch'd his hand to hold him up, and said:
  "poor hapless youth! what praises can be paid
  to love so great, to such transcendent store
  of early worth, and sure presage of more?

  love, anguish, wrath, and grief, to madness wrought,
  despair, and secret shame, and conscious thought

  "great jove," he said, "and the far-shooting god,

  he spoke no more; but hasten'd, void of fear,
  and threaten'd with his long protended spear.

  thrice rode he round; and thrice aeneas wheel'd,

  to wrench the darts which in his buckler light,

  at length resolv'd, he throws with all his force

  and mourning matrons with dishevel'd hair.
  soon as the prince appears, they raise a cry;
  all beat their breasts, and echoes rend the sky.
  they rear his drooping forehead from the ground;
  but, when aeneas view'd the grisly wound
  which pallas in his manly bosom bore,
  and the fair flesh distain'd with purple gore;
  first, melting into tears, the pious man
  deplor'd so sad a sight, then thus began:
  "unhappy youth! when fortune gave the rest

  she came; but brought not thee along, to bless

  while thus their factious minds with fury burn,
  the legates from th' aetolian prince return:
  sad news they bring, that, after all the cost
  and care employ'd, their embassy is lost;
  that diomedes refus'd his aid in war,
  unmov'd with presents, and as deaf to pray'r.
  some new alliance must elsewhere be sought,
  or peace with troy on hard conditions bought.

  latinus, sunk in sorrow, finds too late,
  a foreign son is pointed out by fate;
  and, till aeneas shall lavinia wed,
  the wrath of heav'n is hov'ring o'er his head.
  the gods, he saw, espous'd the juster side,
  when late their titles in the field were tried:
  witness the fresh laments, and fun'ral tears undried.
  thus, full of anxious thought, he summons all
  the latian senate to the council hall.
  the princes come, commanded by their head,
  and crowd the paths that to the palace lead.
  supreme in pow'r, and reverenc'd for his years,
  he takes the throne, and in the midst appears.

  they would have chang'd the fortune of the fight:
  th' invasion of the greeks had been return'd,
  our empire wasted, and our cities burn'd.
  the long defense the trojan people made,
  the war protracted, and the siege delay'd,
  were due to hector's and this hero's hand:
  both brave alike, and equal in command;
  aeneas, not inferior in the field,
  in pious reverence to the gods excell'd.
  make peace, ye latians, and avoid with care
  th' impending dangers of a fatal war.'
  he said no more; but, with this cold excuse,
  refus'd th' alliance, and advis'd a truce."

  thus venulus concluded his report.

  and moves his camp. the scouts with flying speed

  and bending to the town. they take th' alarm:

  unknowingly secure, their way they take;
  from the rough mountains to the plain descend,
  and there, in order drawn, their line extend.

  and turnus views the trojans in array,
  and hears th' approaching horses proudly neigh.

  but happier chance than mine attend thy care!
  this day my hand thy tender age shall shield,
  and crown with honors of the conquer'd field:
  thou, when thy riper years shall send thee forth
  to toils of war, be mindful of my worth;

  he said; and, striding, issued on the plain.
  anteus and mnestheus, and a num'rous train,
  attend his steps; the rest their weapons take,
  and, crowding to the field, the camp forsake.
  a cloud of blinding dust is rais'd around,
  labors beneath their feet the trembling ground.

  fix'd on his wounded face a shaft he bore,
  and, seeking turnus, sent his voice before:
  "turnus, on you, on you alone, depends
  our last relief: compassionate your friends!
  like lightning, fierce aeneas, rolling on,
  with arms invests, with flames invades the town:
  the brands are toss'd on high; the winds conspire
  to drive along the deluge of the fire.
  all eyes are fix'd on you: your foes rejoice;
  ev'n the king staggers, and suspends his choice;
  doubts to deliver or defend the town,
  whom to reject, or whom to call his son.
  the queen, on whom your utmost hopes were plac'd,
  herself suborning death, has breath'd her last.
  't is true, messapus, fearless of his fate,

ould find.
  't was not the fated sword his father bore,
  but that his charioteer metiscus wore.
  this, while the trojans fled, the toughness held;
  but, vain against the great vulcanian shield,
  the mortal-temper'd steel deceiv'd his hand:
  the shiver'd fragments shone amid the sand.

  surpris'd with fear, he fled along the field,
  and now forthright, and now in orbits wheel'd;
  for here the trojan troops the list surround,
  and there the pass is clos'd with pools and marshy ground.
  aeneas hastens, tho' with heavier pace-
  his wound, so newly knit, retards the chase,
  and oft his trembling knees their aid refuse-
  yet, pressing foot by foot, his foe pursues.

  thus, when a fearful stag is clos'd around
  with crimson toils, or in a river found,
  high on the bank the deep-mouth'd hound appears,
  still opening, following still, where'er he steers;
  the persecuted creature, to and fro,
  turns here and there, to scape his umbrian foe:
  steep is th' ascent, and, if he gains t

  from the tough root the ling'ring weapon freed.

  once more erect, the rival chiefs advance:
  one trusts the sword, and one the pointed lance;
  and both resolv'd alike to try their fatal chance.

  meantime imperial jove to juno spoke,
  who from a shining cloud beheld the shock:
  "what new arrest, o queen of heav'n, is sent
  to stop the fates now lab'ring in th' event?
  what farther hopes are left thee to pursue?
  divine aeneas, (and thou know'st it too,)
  foredoom'd, to these celestial seats are due.
  what more attempts for turnus can be made,
  that thus thou ling'rest in this lonely shade?
  is it becoming of the due respect
  and awful honor of a god elect,
  a wound unworthy of our state to feel,
  patient of human hands and earthly steel?
  or seems it just, the sister should restore
  a second sword, when one was lost before,
  and arm a conquer'd wretch against his conqueror?

  but forc'd to bear impos'd eternity!
  take back your envious bribes, and let me go
  companion to my brother's ghost below!
  the joys are vanish'd: nothing now remains,
  of life immortal, but immortal pains.
  what earth will open her devouring womb,
  to rest a weary goddess in the tomb!"
  she drew a length of sighs; nor more she said,
  but in her azure mantle wrapp'd her head,
  then plung'd into her stream, with deep despair,
  and her last sobs came bubbling up in air.

  now stern aeneas his weighty spear
  against his foe, and thus upbraids his fear:
  "what farther subterfuge can turnus find?
  what empty hopes are harbor'd in his mind?
  't is not thy swiftness can secure thy flight;
  not with their feet, but hands, the valiant fight.
  vary thy shape in thousand forms, and dare
  what skill and courage can attempt in war;
  wish for the wings of winds, to mount the sky;
  or hid, within the hollow earth to lie!"
  the champion shook his head, and made this short reply:
