"i have not heard it," answered candide; "but whether he be, or whether he be not, i want bread."

"thou dost not deserve to eat," said the other. "begone, rogue; begone, wretch; do not come near me again."

the orator's wife, putting her head out of the window, and spying a man that doubted whether the pope was anti-christ, poured over him a full.... oh, heavens! to what excess does religious zeal carry the ladies.

a man who had never been christened, a good anabaptist, named james, beheld the cruel and[pg 12] ignominious treatment shown to one of his brethren, an unfeathered biped with a rational soul, he took him home, cleaned him, gave him bread and beer, presented him with two florins, and even wished to teach him the manufacture of persian stuffs which they make in holland. candide, almost prostrating himself before him, cried:

"master pangloss has well said that all is for the best in this world, for i am infinitely more touched by your extreme generos

the next day, as he took a walk, he met a beggar all covered with scabs, his eyes diseased, the end of his nose eaten away, his mouth distorted, his teeth black, choking in his throat, tormented with a violent cough, and spitting out a tooth at each effort.[pg 13]

how candide found his old master pangloss, and what happened to them.

candide, yet more moved with compassion than with horror, gave to this shocking beggar the two florins which he had received from the honest anabaptist james. the spectre looked at him very earnestly, dropped a few tears, and fell upon his neck. candide recoiled in disgust.

"alas!" said one wretch to the other, "do you no longer know your dear pangloss?"

"what do i hear? you, my dear master! you in this terrible plight! what misfortune has happened to you? why are you no longer in the most magnificent of castles? what has become of miss cunegonde, the pearl of girls, and nature's masterpiece?"

"i am so weak that i cannot stand," said panglo

upon which candide carried him to the anabaptist's stable, and gave him a crust of bread. as soon as pangloss had refreshed himself a little:

"well," said candide, "cunegonde?"[pg 14]

"she is dead," replied the other.

candide fainted at this word; his friend recalled his senses with a little bad vinegar which he found by chance in the stable. candide reopened his eyes.

"cunegonde is dead! ah, best of worlds, where art thou? but of what illness did she die? was it not for grief, upon seeing her father kick me out of his magnificent castle?

"well, this is wonderful!" said candide, "but you must get cured."

"alas! how can i?" said pangloss, "i have not a farthing, my friend, and all over the globe there is no letting of blood or taking a glister, without paying, or somebody paying for you."

these last words determined candide; he went and flung himself at the feet of the charitable anabaptist james, and gave him so touching a picture of the state to which his friend was reduced, that the good man did not scruple to take dr. pangloss into his house, and had[pg 17] him cured at his expense. in the cure pangloss lost only an eye and an ear. he wrote well, and knew arithmetic perfectly. the anabaptist james made him his bookkeeper. at the end of two months, being obliged to go to lisbon about some mercantile affairs, he took the two philosophers with him in his ship. pangloss explained

"all this was indispensable," replied the one-eyed doctor, "for private misfortunes make the general good, so that the more private misfortunes there are the greater is the general good."

while he reasoned, the sky darkened, the winds blew from the four quarters, and the ship was assailed by a most terrible tempest within sight of the port of lisbon.[pg 18]

tempest, shipwreck, earthquake, and what became of doctor pangloss, candide, and james the anabaptist.

half dead of that inconceivable anguish which the rolling of a ship produces, one-half of the passengers were not even sensible of the danger. the other half shrieked and prayed. the sheets were rent, the masts broken, the vessel gaped. work who would, no one heard, no one commanded. the anabaptist being upon deck bore a hand; when a brutish sailor struck him roughly and laid him sprawling; but with the violence of the blow he himself tumbled head foremost overboard, and stuck upon a piece of

 the broken mast. honest james ran to his assistance, hauled him up, and from the effort he made was precipitated into the sea in sight of the sailor, who left him to perish, without deigning to look at him. candide drew near and saw his benefactor, who rose above the water one moment and was then swallowed up for ever. he was just going to jump after him, but was prevented by the philosopher pangloss, who[pg 19] demonstrated to him that the bay of lisbon had been made on purpose for the anabaptist to be drowned. while he was proving this Ã  priori, the ship foundered; all perished except pangloss, candide, and that brutal sailor who had drowned the good anabaptist. the villain swam safely to the shore, while pangloss and candide were borne thither upon a plank.

as soon as they recovered themselves a little they walked toward lisbon. they had some money left, with which they hoped to save themselves from starving, after they had escaped drowning. scarcely had they reached the city, lamen

pangloss was hanged, though that was not the custom. the same day the earth sustained a most violent concussion.

candide, terrified, amazed, desperate, all bloody, all palpitating, said to himself:

"if this is the best of possible worlds, what then are the others? well, if i had been only whipped i could put up with it, for i experienced that among the bulgarians; but oh, my dear pangloss! thou greatest of philosophers, that i should have seen you hanged, without knowing for what! oh, my dear anabaptist, thou best of men, that thou should'st have been drowned in the very harbour! oh, miss cunegonde, thou pearl of girls! that thou should'st have had thy belly ripped open!"[pg 25]

thus he was musing, scarce able to stand, preached at, whipped, absolved, and blessed, when an old woman accosted him saying:

"my son, take courage and follow me."[pg 26]

how the old woman took care of candide, and how he found the object he loved.

candide did not take courage, but followed the old woman to a

candide respectfully obeyed her, and though he was still in a surprise, though his voice was feeble and trembling, though his back still pained him, yet he gave her a most ingenuous account of everything that had befallen him since the moment of their separation. cunegonde lifted up her eyes to heaven; shed tears upon hearing of the death of the good anabaptist and of pangloss; after which she spoke as follows to candide, who did not lose a word and devoured her with his eyes.[pg 30]

the history of cunegonde.

"i was in bed and fast asleep when it pleased god to send the bulgarians to our delightful castle of thunder-ten-tronckh; they slew my father and brother, and cut my mother in pieces. a tall bulgarian, six feet high, perceiving that i had fainted away at this sight, began to ravish me; this made me recover; i regained my senses, i cried,
