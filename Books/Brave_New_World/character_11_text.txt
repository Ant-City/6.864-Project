ed. "of course i can stand it. i only said it was 
lovely here because ... well, because progress is lovely, isn't it?" 

"five hundred repetitions once a week from thirteen to seventeen," 
said bernard wearily, as though to himself. 

"what did you say?" 

"i said that progress was lovely. that's why you mustn't come to the 
reservation unless you really want to." 



"but i do want to." 

"very well, then," said bernard; and it was almost a threat. 

their permit required the signature of the warden of the reservation, 
at whose office next morning they duly presented themselves. an 
epsilon-plus negro porter took in bernard's card, and they were admit- 
ted almost immediately. 

the warden was a blond and brachycephalic alpha-minus, short, red, 
moon-faced, and broad-shouldered, with a loud booming voice, very 
well adapted to the utterance of hypnopaedic wisdom. he was a mine 
of irrelevant information and unasked-for good advice. once started, 
he went on and on-boomingly. 

"... five h

"... supplied with current from the grand canyon hydro-electric sta- 
tion." 

"cost me a fortune by the time i get back." with his mind's eye, ber- 
nard saw the needle on the scent meter creeping round and round, 
antlike, indefatigable. "quickly telephone to helmholtz watson." 

"... upwards of five thousand kilometres of fencing at sixty thousand 
volts." 

"you don't say so," said lenina politely, not knowing in the least what 
the warden had said, but taking her cue from his dramatic pause. 
when the warden started booming, she had inconspicuously swallowed 
half a gramme of soma, with the result that she could now sit, se- 
renely not listening, thinking of nothing at all, but with her large blue 
eyes fixed on the warden's face in an expression of rapt attention. 

"to touch the fence is instant death," pronounced the warden sol- 
emnly. "there is no escape from a savage reservation." 



the word "escape" was suggestive. "pe

rhaps," said bernard, half ris- 
ing, "we ought to think of going." the little black needle was scurrying, 
an insect, nibbling through time, eating into his money. 

"no escape," repeated the warden, waving him back into his chair; 
and as the permit was not yet countersigned bernard had no choice 
but to obey. "those who are born in the reservation-and remember, 
my dear young lady," he added, leering obscenely at lenina, and 
speaking in an improper whisper, "remember that, in the reservation, 
children still are born, yes, actually born, revolting as that may seem 
..." (he hoped that this reference to a shameful subject would make 
lenina blush; but she only smiled with simulated intel

ligence and said, 
"you don't say so!" disappointed, the warden began again. ) "those, i 
repeat who are born in the reservation are destined to die there." 

destined to die ... a decilitre of eau de cologne every minute. six litres 
an hour. "perhaps," bernard tried again, "we ought ..." 

leaning forward, the warden tapped the table with his forefinger. "you 
ask me how many people live in the reservation. and i reply"-trium- 
phantly-"i reply that we do not know. we can only guess." 

"you don't say so." 

"my dear young lady, i do say so." 

six times twenty-four-no, it would be nearer six times thirty-six. ber- 
nard was pale and trembling with impatience. but inexorably the 
booming continued. 

"... about sixty thousand indians and half-breeds ... absolute savages ...

lenina shook her head. "was and will make me ill," she quoted, "i take 
a gramme and only am." 

in the end she persuaded him to swallow four tablets of soma. five 
minutes later roots and fruits were abolished; the flower of the present 
rosily blossomed. a message from the porter announced that, at the 
warden's orders, a reservation guard had come round with a plane 
and was waiting on the roof of the hotel. they went up at once. an oc- 
toroon in gamma-green uniform saluted and proceeded to recite the 
morning's programme. 

a bird's-eye view of ten or a dozen of the principal pueblos, then a 
landing for lunch in the valley of malpais. the rest-house was comfort-

-seven and a half it was the deep, reso- 
nant voice of mustapha mond himself that sounded in his ears. 

"i ventured to think," stammered bernard, "that your fordship might 
find the matter of sufficient scientific interest ..." 

"yes, i do find it of sufficient scientific interest," said the deep voice. 
"bring these two individuals back to london with you." 

"your fordship is aware that i shall need a special permit ..." 

"the necessary orders," said mustapha mond, "are being sent to the 
warden of the reservation at this moment. you will proceed at once to 
the warden's office. good-morning, mr. marx." 

there was silence. bernard hung up the receiver and hurried up to the 
roof. 

"warden's office," he said to the gamma-green octoroon. 
at ten fifty-four bernard was shaking hands with the warden. 
"delighted, mr. marx, delighted." his boom was deferential. "we have 
just received special orders ..." 

"i know," said bernard, interrupting him. "i was talking to his fordship

one a moment ago." his bored tone implied that he was in 
the habit of talking to his fordship every day of the week. he dropped 
into a chair. "if you'll kindly take all the necessary steps as soon as 
possible. as soon as possible," he emphatically repeated. he was thor- 
oughly enjoying himself. 

at eleven three he had all the necessary papers in his pocket. 
"so long," he said patronizingly to the warden, who had accompanied 
him as far as the lift gates. "so long." 

he walked across to the hotel, had a bath, a vibro-vac massage, and 
an electrolytic shave, listened in to the morning's news, looked in for 
half an hour on the televisor, ate a leisured luncheon, and at half-past 
two flew back with the octoroon to malpais. 
the young man stood outside the rest-house. 
"bernard," he called. "bernard!" there was no answer. 



noiseless on his deerksin moccasins, he ran up the steps and tried the
