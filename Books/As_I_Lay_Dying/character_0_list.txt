Addie Bundren - 
                 The
wife of Anse Bundren and mother to Cash, Darl, Jewel, Dewey Dell,
and Vardaman. Addie is a mostly absent protagonist, and her death
triggers the novel's action. She is a former schoolteacher whose bitter,
loveless life causes her to despise her husband and to invest all
of her love in her favorite child, Jewel, rather than in the rest
of her family or God.
