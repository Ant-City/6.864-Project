t, on their way up to the changing rooms, henry foster and 
the assistant director of predestination rather pointedly turned their 
backs on bernard marx from the psychology bureau: averted them- 
selves from that unsavoury reputation. 

the faint hum and rattle of machinery still stirred the crimson air in 
the embryo store. shifts might come and go, one lupus-coloured face 
give place to another; majestically and for ever the conveyors crept 
forward with their load of future men and women. 

lenina crowne walked briskly towards the door. 

his fordship mustapha mond! the eyes of the saluting students almost 
popped out of their heads. mustapha mond! the resident controller for 
western europe! one of the ten world controllers. one of the ten ... 
and he sat down on the bench with the d.h.c, he was going to stay, 
to stay, yes, and actually talk to them ... straight from the horse's 
mouth. straight from the mouth of ford himself.

their diaphragms. "try to realize what it was like to have a viviparous 
mother." 

that smutty word again. but none of them dreamed, this time, of smil-

"try to imagine what 'living with one's family' meant." 

they tried; but obviously without the smallest success. 

"and do you know what a 'home' was?" 

they shook their heads. 

from her dim crimson cellar lenina crowne shot up seventeen stories, 
turned to the right as she stepped out of the lift, walked down a long 
corridor and, opening the door marked girls' dressing-room, 
plunged into a deafening chaos of arms and bosoms and undercloth- 
ing. torrents of hot water were splashing into or gurgling out of a hun-

burnt flesh of eighty superb female specimens. every one was ta

barriers. 

"fortunate boys!" said the controller. "no pains have been spared to 
make your lives emotionally easy-to preserve you, so far as that is 
possible, from having emotions at all." 

"ford's in his flivver," murmured the d.h.c. "all's well with the world." 

"lenina crowne?" said henry foster, echoing the assistant predestina- 
tor's question as he zipped up his trousers. "oh, she's a splendid girl. 
wonderfully pneumatic. i'm surprised you haven't had her." 

"i can't think how it is i haven't," said the assistant predestinator. "i 
certainly will. at the first opportunity."

bernard's plane and slammed the door that they gave up pursuit. not 
without reproaches. 

"these women!" he said, as the machine rose into the air. "these 
women!" and he shook his head, he frowned. "too awful," bernard 
hypocritically agreed, wishing, as he spoke the words, that he could 
have as many girls as helmholtz did, and with as little trouble. he was 
seized with a sudden urgent need to boast. "i'm taking lenina crowne 
to new mexico with me," he said in a tone as casual as he could make 
it. 

"are you?" said helmholtz, with a total absence of interest. then after 
a little pause, "this last week or two," he went on, "i've been cutting 
all my committees and all my girls. you can't imagine what a hullaba-
