  rom. what, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
    or shall we on without apology?

    o cousin, cousin!

  prince. benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

  ben. tybalt, here slain, whom romeo's hand did stay.
    romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
    how nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal
    your high displeasure. all this- uttered
    with gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd-
    could not take truce with the unruly spleen
    of tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
    with piercing steel at bold mercutio's breast;
    who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
    and, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
    cold death aside and with the other sends
    it back to tybalt, whose dexterity
    retorts it. romeo he cries aloud,
    'hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,
    his agile arm beats down their fatal points,
    and 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
    an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life
    of stout mercutio, and then tybalt fled;

 for, ere i
    could draw to part them, was stout tybalt slain;
    and, as he fell, did romeo turn and fly.
    this is the truth, or let benvolio die.

  cap. wife. he is a kinsman to the montague;
    affection makes him false, he speaks not true.
    some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
    and all those twenty could but kill one life.
    i beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give.
    romeo slew tybalt; romeo must not live.

  prince. romeo slew him; he slew mercutio.
    who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?

  mon. not romeo, prince; he was mercutio's friend;
    his fault concludes but what the law should end,
    the life of tybalt.

    immediately we do exile him hence.

    my blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;

    that you shall all repent the loss of mine.
