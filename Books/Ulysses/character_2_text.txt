 which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. a yellow dressinggown,
ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. he
held the bowl aloft and intoned:

â€”introibo ad altare dei.

halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:

â€”come up, kinch! come up, you fearful jesuit!

solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. he faced about
and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the
awaking mountains. then, catching sight of stephen dedalus, he bent
towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat
and shaking his head. stephen dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned
his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking
gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light
untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.

buck mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the
bowl smartly.

â€”back to barracks! he said sternly.

he added in a preacherâ€™s tone:

e cried briskly. that will do nicely. switch off the
current, will you?

he skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering
about his legs the loose folds of his gown. the plump shadowed face and
sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.
a pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.

â€”the mockery of it! he said gaily. your absurd name, an ancient greek!

he pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,
laughing to himself. stephen dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily
halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as
he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and
lathered cheeks and neck.

buck mulliganâ€™s gay voice went on.

â€”my name is absurd too: malachi mulligan, two dactyls. but it has a
hellenic ring, hasnâ€™t it? tripping and sunny like the buck himself.
we must go to athens. will you come if i can get the aunt to fork out
twenty quid?

mr oâ€™madden burke, tall in copious grey of donegal tweed, came in from
the hallway. stephen dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.

â€”entrez, mes enfants! lenehan cried.

â€”i escort a suppliant, mr oâ€™madden burke said melodiously. youth led by
experience visits notoriety.

stephen dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidaryâ€™s fingers
prove a timedulled chain. dust webbed the window and the showtrays. dust
darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails. dust slept
on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies,
leprous and winedark stones.
