      vivian's younger sister. carmen is flirtatious, wears provocative clothing (and occasionally none at all), and could be considered not only a psychotic but also a nymphomaniac. she sucks her thumb, giggles, and has a habit of repeating "you're cute" to the men who cross her path. whether or not carmen is a nymphomaniac, she is clearly prone to drinking, drugs, and sexual behavior, and is mentally unstable. beneath her innocent, thumb-sucking, child-like veneer, she is the murderess of rusty regan.
