     clown. how! my soul to the devil for a shoulder of mutton, though

     clown. do you hear, sir? you may save that labour; they are too
     familiar with me already:  swowns, they are as bold with my flesh
     as if they had paid for their[72] meat and drink.

     clown. let your baliol and your belcher come here, and i'll
     knock them, they were never so knocked since they were devils:
     say i should kill one of them, what would folks say?  "do ye see
     yonder tall fellow in the round slop?[73] he has killed the devil."
     so i should be called kill-devil all the parish over.
