the condition of the english nation was at this time sufficiently
miserable. king richard was absent a prisoner, and in the power of
the perfidious and cruel duke of austria. even the very place of his
captivity was uncertain, and his fate but very imperfectly known to the
generality of his subjects, who were, in the meantime, a prey to every
species of subaltern oppression.

prince john, in league with philip of france, coeur-de-lion‚Äôs mortal
enemy, was using every species of influence with the duke of austria, to
prolong the captivity of his brother richard, to whom he stood indebted
for so many favours. in the meantime, he was strengthening his own
faction in the kingdom, of which he proposed to dispute the succession,
in case of the king‚Äôs death, with the legitimate heir, arthur duke of
brittany, son of geoffrey plantagenet, the elder brother of john. this

grand spectacle of that age, felt as much interested as the half-starved
citizen of madrid, who has not a real left to buy provisions for his
family, feels in the issue of a bull-feast. neither duty nor infirmity
could keep youth or age from such exhibitions. the passage of arms,
as it was called, which was to take place at ashby, in the county of
leicester, as champions of the first renown were to take the field
in the presence of prince john himself, who was expected to grace the
lists, had attracted universal attention, and an immense confluence of
persons of all ranks hastened upon the appointed morning to the place of
combat.

the scene was singularly romantic. on the verge of a wood, which
approached to within a mile of the town of ashby, was an extensive
meadow, of the finest and most beautiful green turf, surrounded on one
side by the forest, and fringed on the other by straggling oak-trees,
some of which had grown to an imme

it only remains to notice respecting the general arrangement, that
one gallery in the very centre of the eastern side of the lists, and
consequently exactly opposite to the spot where the shock of the combat
was to take place, was raised higher than the others, more richly
decorated, and graced by a sort of throne and canopy, on which the
royal arms were emblazoned. squires, pages, and yeomen in rich liveries,
waited around this place of honour, which was designed for prince john
and his attendants. opposite to this royal gallery was another, elevated
to the same height, on the western side of the lists; and more gaily, if
less sumptuously decorated, than that destined for the prince himself.
a train of pages and of young maidens, the most beautiful who could be
selected, gaily dressed in fancy habits of green and pink, surrounded
a throne decorated in the same colours. among pennons and flags bearing
wounded hearts, burning hearts, bleeding hearts, bows and quivers,

ng to fear. it was not in places of general
resort, or where their equals were assembled, that any avaricious or
malevolent noble durst offer him injury. at such meetings the jews
were under the protection of the general law; and if that proved a
weak assurance, it usually happened that there were among the persons
assembled some barons, who, for their own interested motives, were ready
to act as their protectors. on the present occasion, isaac felt more
than usually confident, being aware that prince john was even then in
the very act of negotiating a large loan from the jews of york, to
be secured upon certain jewels and lands. isaac‚Äôs own share in this
transaction was considerable, and he well knew that the prince‚Äôs eager
desire to bring it to a conclusion would ensure him his protection in
the dilemma in which he stood.

emboldened by these considerations, the jew pursued his point, and
jostled the norman christian, without respect either to his descent,
quality, or religion. the complain

the preposterous fashion of the time, turned up so very far, as to
be attached, not to his knees merely, but to his very girdle, and
effectually prevented him from putting his foot into the stirrup. this,
however, was a slight inconvenience to the gallant abbot, who,
perhaps, even rejoicing in the opportunity to display his accomplished
horsemanship before so many spectators, especially of the fair sex,
dispensed with the use of these supports to a timid rider. the rest
of prince john‚Äôs retinue consisted of the favourite leaders of his
mercenary troops, some marauding barons and profligate attendants upon
the court, with several knights templars and knights of st john.

it may be here remarked, that the knights of these two orders were
accounted hostile to king richard, having adopted the side of philip
of france in the long train of disputes which took place in palestine
betwixt that monarch and the lion-hearted king of england. it was the
well-known consequence of this d

iscord that richard‚Äôs repeated victories
had been rendered fruitless, his romantic attempts to besiege jerusalem
disappointed, and the fruit of all the glory which he had acquired had
dwindled into an uncertain truce with the sultan saladin. with the same
policy which had dictated the conduct of their brethren in the holy
land, the templars and hospitallers in england and normandy attached
themselves to the faction of prince john, having little reason to desire
the return of richard to england, or the succession of arthur, his
legitimate heir. for the opposite reason, prince john hated and
contemned the few saxon families of consequence which subsisted in
england, and omitted no opportunity of mortifying and affronting them;
being conscious that his person and pretensions were disliked by them,
as well as by the greater part of the english commons, who feared
farther innovation upon their rights and liberties, from a so

dressed in crimson and in gold, bearing upon his hand a falcon, and
having his head covered by a rich fur bonnet, adorned with a circle of
precious stones, from which his long curled hair escaped and overspread
his shoulders, prince john, upon a grey and high-mettled palfrey,
caracoled within the lists at the head of his jovial party, laughing
loud with his train, and eyeing with all the boldness of royal criticism
the beauties who adorned the lofty galleries.

audacity, mingled with extreme haughtiness and indifference to the
feelings of others could not yet deny to his countenance that sort of
comeliness which belongs to an open set of features, well formed by

manly frankness, when in truth it arises from the reckless indifference
of a libertine disposition, conscious of superiority of birth, of
wealth, or of some other adventitious advantage, totally unconnected
with personal merit. to those who did not think so deeply, and they were
the greater number by a hundred to one, the splendour of prince john‚Äôs
‚Äúrheno‚Äù, (i.e. fur tippet,) the richness of his cloak, lined with the
most costly sables, his maroquin boots and golden spurs, together with
the grace with which he managed his palfrey, were sufficient to merit
clamorous applause.

in his joyous caracole round the lists, the attention of the prince
was called by the commotion, not yet subsided, which had attended the
ambitious movement of isaac towards the higher places of the assembly.

the figure of rebecca might indeed have compared with the proudest
beauties of england, even though it had been judged by as shrewd a
connoisseur as prince john. her form was exquisitely symmetrical,
and was shown to advantage by a sort of eastern dress, which she wore
according to the fashion of the females of her nation. her turban
of yellow silk suited well with the darkness of her complexion. the
brilliancy of her eyes, the superb arch of her eyebrows, her well-formed
aquiline nose, her teeth as white as pearl, and the profusion of her
sable tresses, which, each arranged in its own little spiral of twisted

turban by an agraffe set with brilliants, was another distinction of
the beautiful jewess, scoffed and sneered at by the proud dames who sat
above her, but secretly envied by those who affected to deride them.

‚Äúby the bald scalp of abraham,‚Äù said prince john, ‚Äúyonder jewess must be
the very model of that perfection, whose charms drove frantic the wisest
king that ever lived! what sayest thou, prior aymer?--by the temple
of that wise king, which our wiser brother richard proved unable to
recover, she is the very bride of the canticles!‚Äù

attendants of prince john; but de bracy, whose profession freed him from
all scruples, extended his long lance over the space which separated
the gallery from the lists, and would have executed the commands of
the prince before athelstane the unready had recovered presence of mind

around him conjuring him to be patient, partly by a general exclamation
of the crowd, uttered in loud applause of the spirited conduct of
cedric. the prince rolled his eyes in indignation, as if to collect some
safe and easy victim; and chancing to encounter the firm glance of the

this allusion to the fate of william rufus, his relative, at once
incensed and alarmed prince john. he satisfied himself, however, with
commanding the men-at-arms, who surrounded the lists, to keep an eye on
the braggart, pointing to the yeoman.

to give his voice to the feats of others!‚Äù

precedence though it had led him to dispute place with the extenuated
and impoverished descendant of the line of montdidier, by no means
stimulated him to an intrusion upon the privileges of the wealthy
saxons.

‚Äúup, infidel dog when i command you,‚Äù said prince john, ‚Äúor i will have
thy swarthy hide stript off, and tanned for horse-furniture.‚Äù

thus urged, the jew began to ascend the steep and narrow steps which led
up to the gallery.

‚Äúlet me see,‚Äù said the prince, ‚Äúwho dare stop him,‚Äù fixing his eye on
cedric, whose attitude intimated his intention to hurl the jew down
headlong.

the catastrophe was prevented by the clown wamba, who, springing

doubtless, he had furnished himself, lest the tournament should have
proved longer than his appetite could endure abstinence. finding the
abomination of his tribe opposed to his very nose, while the jester,
at the same time, flourished his wooden sword above his head, the jew
recoiled, missed his footing, and rolled down the steps,--an excellent
jest to the spectators, who set up a loud laughter, in which prince john
and his attendants heartily joined.

‚Äúdeal me the prize, cousin prince,‚Äù said wamba; ‚Äúi have vanquished my
foe in fair fight with sword and shield,‚Äù he added, brandishing the
brawn in one hand and the wooden sword in the other.

‚Äúwho, and what art thou, noble champion?‚Äù said prince john, still
laughing.

as the jew, stunned by the request, afraid to refuse, and unwilling
to comply, fumbled in the furred bag which hung by his girdle, and
was perhaps endeavouring to ascertain how few coins might pass for a
handful, the prince stooped from his jennet and settled isaac‚Äôs doubts
by snatching the pouch itself from his side; and flinging to wamba a
couple of the gold pieces which it contained, he pursued his career

in the midst of prince john‚Äôs cavalcade, he suddenly stopt, and
appealing to the prior of jorvaulx, declared the principal business of
the day had been forgotten.

‚Äúby my halidom,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúwe have forgotten, sir prior, to name the

be distributed. for my part, i am liberal in my ideas, and i care not if
i give my vote for the black-eyed rebecca.‚Äù

churls.‚Äù

a murmur arose even among his own immediate attendants.

‚Äúthis passes a jest, my lord,‚Äù said de bracy; ‚Äúno knight here will lay
lance in rest if such an insult is attempted.‚Äù

‚Äúit is the mere wantonness of insult,‚Äù said one of the oldest and most
important of prince john‚Äôs followers, waldemar fitzurse, ‚Äúand if your
grace attempt it, cannot but prove ruinous to your projects.‚Äù

‚Äúi entertained you, sir,‚Äù said john, reining up his palfrey haughtily,
‚Äúfor my follower, but not for my counsellor.‚Äù

waldemar, but speaking in a low voice, ‚Äúacquire the right of

their own.‚Äù

others around these lists, sir prior, who will not fear to encounter
him.‚Äù

‚Äúsilence, sirs,‚Äù said waldemar, ‚Äúand let the prince assume his seat.
the knights and spectators are alike impatient, the time advances, and
highly fit it is that the sports should commence.‚Äù

prince john, though not yet a monarch, had in waldemar fitzurse all the
inconveniences of a favourite minister, who, in serving his sovereign,
must always do so in his own way. the prince acquiesced, however,
although his disposition was precisely of that kind which is apt to be
obstinate upon trifles, and, assuming his throne, and being surrounded
by his followers, gave signal to the heralds to proclaim the laws of the
tournament, which were briefly as follows:

first, the five challengers were to underta

d matchless strength; and in addition to this reward of valour,
it was now declared, he should have the peculiar honour of naming the
queen of love and beauty, by whom the prize should be given on the
ensuing day.

fourthly, it was announced, that, on the second day, there should be a
general tournament, in which all the knights present, who were desirous
to win praise, might take part; and being divided into two bands of
equal numbers, might fight it out manfully, until the signal was given
by prince john to cease the combat. the elected queen of love and beauty
was then to crown the knight whom the prince should adjudge to have
borne himself best in this second day, with a coronet composed of thin
gold plate, cut into the shape of a laurel crown. on this second day
the knightly games ceased. but on that which was to follow, feats of
archery, of bull-baiting, and other popular amusements, were to be
practised, for the more immediate amusement of the populace. in this
manner did prince john endea

ances! stand forth gallant knights, fair eyes look upon your deeds!‚Äù

the music also of the challengers breathed from time to time wild bursts
expressive of triumph or defiance, while the clowns grudged a holiday
which seemed to pass away in inactivity; and old knights and nobles
lamented in whispers the decay of martial spirit, spoke of the triumphs
of their younger days, but agreed that the land did not now supply dames
of such transcendent beauty as had animated the jousts of former times.
prince john began to talk to his attendants about making ready
the banquet, and the necessity of adjudging the prize to brian de
bois-guilbert, who had, with a single spear, overthrown two knights, and
foiled a third.

at length, as the saracenic music of the challengers concluded one of
those long and high flourishes with which they had broken the silence of
the lists, it was answered by a solitary trumpet, which breathed a note
of defiance from the northern extremity. all eyes were turned to see

pectators, waving of scarfs and handkerchiefs,
and general acclamations, attested the interest taken by the spectators
in this encounter; the most equal, as well as the best performed, which
had graced the day. but no sooner had the knights resumed their station,
than the clamour of applause was hushed into a silence, so deep and so
dead, that it seemed the multitude were afraid even to breathe.

a few minutes pause having been allowed, that the combatants and their
horses might recover breath, prince john with his truncheon signed to
the trumpets to sound the onset. the champions a second time sprung from
their stations, and closed in the centre of the lists, with the same
speed, the same dexterity, the same violence, but not the same equal
fortune as before.

in this second encounter, the templar aimed at the centre of his
antagonist‚Äôs shield, and struck it so fair and forcibly, that his spear
went to shivers, and the disinherited knight reeled in his saddle.

william de wyvil and stephen de martival, the marshals of the field,
were the first to offer their congratulations to the victor, praying
him, at the same time, to suffer his helmet to be unlaced, or, at least,
that he would raise his visor ere they conducted him to receive
the prize of the day‚Äôs tourney from the hands of prince john. the
disinherited knight, with all knightly courtesy, declined their request,
alleging, that he could not at this time suffer his face to be seen, for
reasons which he had assigned to the heralds when he entered the lists.
the marshals were perfectly satisfied by this reply; for amidst the
frequent and capricious vows by which knights were accustomed to bind
themselves in the days of chivalry, there were none more common than
those by which they engaged to remain incognito for a certain space,

until some particular adventure was achieved. the marshals, therefore,
pressed no farther into the mystery of the disinherited knight, but,
announcing to prince john the conqueror‚Äôs desire to remain unknown, they
requested permission to bring him before his grace, in order that he
might receive the reward of his valour.

john‚Äôs curiosity was excited by the mystery observed by the stranger;
and, being already displeased with the issue of the tournament, in which
the challengers whom he favoured had been successively defeated by one
knight, he answered haughtily to the marshals, ‚Äúby the light of our

‚Äúyour temple champion had no better luck. i saw your brave lance,
bois-guilbert, roll thrice over, grasping his hands full of sand at
every turn.‚Äù

de bracy, being attached to the templars, would have replied, but was
prevented by prince john. ‚Äúsilence, sirs!‚Äù he said; ‚Äúwhat unprofitable
debate have we here?‚Äù

‚Äúthe victor,‚Äù said de wyvil, ‚Äústill waits the pleasure of your

whether there is not some one who can at least guess at his name and

to keep him warm.‚Äù

‚Äúit may be the earl of salisbury,‚Äù said de bracy; ‚Äúhe is about the same

‚Äúsir thomas de multon, the knight of gilsland, rather,‚Äù said fitzurse;
‚Äúsalisbury is bigger in the bones.‚Äù a whisper arose among the train,
but by whom first suggested could not be ascertained. ‚Äúit might be the
king--it might be richard coeur-de-lion himself!‚Äù

‚Äúover god‚Äôs forbode!‚Äù said prince john, involuntarily turning at the
same time as pale as death, and shrinking as if blighted by a flash of
lightning; ‚Äúwaldemar!--de bracy! brave knights and gentlemen, remember
your promises, and stand truly by me!‚Äù

‚Äúhere is no danger impending,‚Äù said waldemar fitzurse; ‚Äúare you so

to think they can be held within the circumference of yonder suit

horse he backs, could not have carried the ponderous weight of king
richard through a single course.‚Äù

while he was yet speaking, the marshals brought forward the disinherited
knight to the foot of a wooden flight of steps, which formed the ascent
from the lists to prince john‚Äôs throne. still discomposed with the idea
that his brother, so much injured, and to whom he was so much indebted,
had suddenly arrived in his native kingdom, even the distinctions
pointed out by fitzurse did not altogether remove the prince‚Äôs
apprehensions; and while, with a short and embarrassed eulogy upon his
valour, he caused to be delivered to him the war-horse assigned as the
prize, he trembled lest from the barred visor of the mailed form before
him, an answer might be returned, in t

prince accordingly made a sign with his truncheon, as the knight
passed him in his second career around the lists. the knight turned
towards the throne, and, sinking his lance, until the point was within
a foot of the ground, remained motionless, as if expecting john‚Äôs
commands; while all admired the sudden dexterity with which he instantly
reduced his fiery steed from a state of violent emotion and high
excitation to the stillness of an equestrian statue.

‚Äúsir disinherited knight,‚Äù said prince john, ‚Äúsince that is the only
title by which we can address you, it is now your duty, as well as
privilege, to name the fair lady, who, as queen of honour and of love,
is to preside over next day‚Äôs festival. if, as a stranger in our land,
you should require the aid of other judgment to guide your own, we
can only say that alicia, the daughter of our gallant knight waldemar
fitzurse, has at our court been long held the first in beauty as in
place. nevertheless, it is your undoubted prerogative to

your choice, the election of to-morrow‚Äôs queen will be formal and

the knight obeyed; and prince john placed upon its point a coronet of
green satin, having around its edge a circlet of gold, the upper edge
of which was relieved by arrow-points and hearts placed interchangeably,
like the strawberry leaves and balls upon a ducal crown.

in the broad hint which he dropped respecting the daughter of waldemar
fitzurse, john had more than one motive, each the offspring of a mind,
which was a strange mixture of carelessness and presumption with low
artifice and cunning. he wished to banish from the m

t, who were
as much unused to see the preference given to a saxon beauty, as the
norman nobles were to sustain defeat in the games of chivalry which they
themselves had introduced. but these sounds of disaffection were drowned
by the popular shout of ‚Äúlong live the lady rowena, the chosen and
lawful queen of love and of beauty!‚Äù to which many in the lower area
added, ‚Äúlong live the saxon princess! long live the race of the immortal
alfred!‚Äù

however unacceptable these sounds might be to prince john, and to
those around him, he saw himself nevertheless obliged to confirm the
nomination of the victor, and accordingly calling to horse, he left
his throne; and mounting his jennet, accompanied by his train, he again
entered the lists. the prince paused a moment beneath the gallery of
the lady alicia, to whom he paid his compliments, observing, at the same
time, to those around him--‚Äúby my halidome, sirs! if the knight‚Äôs feats
in arms have shown that he hath limbs and sinews, his choice hat

ers of those whom he wished to
conciliate. waldemar fitzurse was rather offended than pleased at the
prince stating thus broadly an opinion, that his daughter had been
slighted.

‚Äúi know no right of chivalry,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúmore precious or inalienable
than that of each free knight to choose his lady-love by his own
judgment. my daughter courts distinction from no one; and in her own
character, and in her own sphere, will never fail to receive the full
proportion of that which is her due.‚Äù

prince john replied not; but, spurring his horse, as if to give vent
to his vexation, he made the animal bound forward to the gallery where
rowena was seated, with the crown still at her feet.

‚Äúassume,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúfair lady, the mark of your sovereignty, to which
none vows homage more sincerely than ourself, john of anjou; and if

the lady rowena will take upon her the state to which she has been
called by the free election of the victor knight, confirmed by the
acclamations of the people.‚Äù

so saying, he lifted the coronet, and placed it upon rowena‚Äôs head, in
token of her acceptance of the temporary authority assigned to her.

‚Äúwhat says he?‚Äù said prince john, affecting not to understand the
saxon language, in which, however, he was well skilled. the purport of
cedric‚Äôs speech was repeated to him in french. ‚Äúit is well,‚Äù he said;
‚Äúto-morrow we will ourself conduct this mute sovereign to her seat of
dignity.--you, at least, sir knight,‚Äù he added, turning to the victor,
who had remained near the gallery, ‚Äúwill this day share our banquet?‚Äù

the knight, speaking for the first time, in a low and hurried voice,
excused himself by pleading fa

tigue, and the necessity of preparing for
to-morrow‚Äôs encounter.

‚Äúit is well,‚Äù said prince john, haughtily; ‚Äúalthough unused to such
refusals, we will endeavour to digest our banquet as we may, though
ungraced by the most successful in arms, and his elected queen of
beauty.‚Äù

so saying, he prepared to leave the lists with his glittering train, and
his turning his steed for that purpose, was the signal for the breaking
up and dispersion of the spectators.

yet, with the vindictive memory proper to offended pride, especially
when combined with conscious want of desert, john had hardly p

the day, and issued his commands to the men-at-arms who stood near--‚Äúon
your life, suffer not that fellow to escape.‚Äù

the yeoman stood the angry glance of the prince with the same unvaried
steadiness which had marked his former deportment, saying, with a smile,
‚Äúi have no intention to leave ashby until the day after to-morrow--i
must see how staffordshire and leicestershire can draw their bows--the
forests of needwood and charnwood must rear good archers.‚Äù

‚Äúi,‚Äù said prince john to his attendants, but not in direct reply,--‚Äúi
will see how he can draw his own; and woe betide him unless his skill
should prove some apology for his insolence!‚Äù

‚Äúit is full time,‚Äù said de bracy, ‚Äúthat the ‚Äòoutrecuidance‚Äô [19] of
these peasants should be restrained by some striking example.‚Äù

readiest road to popularity, shrugged up his shoulders and was silent.

ring over the plain. by far the most numerous part streamed towards
the town of ashby, where many of the distinguished persons were lodged
in the castle, and where others found accommodation in the town itself.
among these were most of the knights who had already appeared in the
tournament, or who proposed to fight there the ensuing day, and who, as
they rode slowly along, talking over the events of the day, were greeted
with loud shouts by the populace. the same acclamations were bestowed
upon prince john, although he was indebted for them rather to the
splendour of his appearance and train, than to the popularity of his
character.

a more sincere and more general, as well as a better-merited
acclamation, attended the victor of the day, until, anxious to withdraw
himself from popular notice, he accepted the accommodation of one of
those pavilions pitched at the extremities of the lists, the use of
which was courteously tendered him by the marshals of the field. on his

the disinherited knight had no sooner reached his pavilion, than squires
and pages in abundance tendered their services to disarm him, to bring
fresh attire, and to offer him the refreshment of the bath. their zeal
on this occasion was perhaps sharpened by curiosity, since every one
desired to know who the knight was that had gained so many laurels, yet
had refused, even at the command of prince john, to lift his visor or
to name his name. but their officious inquisitiveness was not gratified.
the disinherited knight refused all other assistance save that of his
own squire, or rather yeoman--a clownish-looking man, who, wrapt in a
cloak of dark-coloured felt, and having his head and face half-buried
in a norman bonnet made of black fur, seemed to affect the incognito
as much as his master. all others being excluded from the tent, this
attendant relieved his master from the more burdensome p

casting his eyes to the roof of the apartment, as one who laboured under
great mental tribulation. ‚Äúo, jacob!‚Äù he exclaimed--‚Äúo, all ye twelve
holy fathers of our tribe! what a losing venture is this for one who
hath duly kept every jot and tittle of the law of moses--fifty zecchins
wrenched from me at one clutch, and by the talons of a tyrant!‚Äù

‚Äúbut, father,‚Äù said rebecca, ‚Äúyou seemed to give the gold to prince john

‚Äúwillingly? the blotch of egypt upon him!--willingly, saidst thou?--ay,

others with whom they were more upon an equality. on the present
occasion, about fifty knights were inscribed as desirous of combating
upon each side, when the marshals declared that no more could be
admitted, to the disappointment of several who were too late in
preferring their claim to be included.

about the hour of ten o‚Äôclock, the whole plain was crowded with
horsemen, horsewomen, and foot-passengers, hastening to the tournament;
and shortly after, a grand flourish of trumpets announced prince john
and his retinue, attended by many of those knights who meant to take
share in the game, as well as others who had no such intention.

about the same time arrived cedric the saxon, with the lady rowena,
unattended, however, by athelstane. this saxon lord had arrayed his
tall and strong person in armour, in order to take his place among the
combatants; and, considerably to the surprise of cedric, had chosen to
enlist himself on the part of the knight templar. the saxon, indeed, had
remonstrated s

select rowena as the object of that honour which it became his privilege
to confer. in order to punish him for a preference which seemed to
interfere with his own suit, athelstane, confident of his strength,
and to whom his flatterers, at least, ascribed great skill in arms, had
determined not only to deprive the disinherited knight of his powerful
succour, but, if an opportunity should occur, to make him feel the
weight of his battle-axe.

de bracy, and other knights attached to prince john, in obedience to
a hint from him, had joined the party of the challengers, john being
desirous to secure, if possible, the victory to that side. on the
other hand, many other knights, both english and norman, natives and
strangers, took part against the challengers, the more readily that
the opposite band was to be led by so distinguished a champion as the
disinherited knight had approved himself.

as soon as prince john observed that the destined queen of the day had
arrived upon the field, as

suming that air of courtesy which sat well
upon him when he was pleased to exhibit it, he rode forward to meet
her, doffed his bonnet, and, alighting from his horse, assisted the lady
rowena from her saddle, while his followers uncovered at the same time,
and one of the most distinguished dismounted to hold her palfrey.

‚Äúit is thus,‚Äù said prince john, ‚Äúthat we set the dutiful example of
loyalty to the queen of love and beauty, and are ourselves her guide to
the throne which she must this day occupy.--ladies,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúattend
your queen, as you wish in your turn to be distinguished by like
honours.‚Äù

so saying, the prince marshalled rowena to the seat of honour opposite
his own, while the fairest and most distinguished ladies present crowded
after her to obtain places as near as possible to their temporary
sovereign.

a knight thus overcome was not permitted to take farther share in the
combat. if any combatant was struck down, and unable to recover his
feet, his squire or page might enter the lists, and drag his master out
of the press; but in that case the knight was adjudged vanquished, and
his arms and horse declared forfeited. the combat was to cease as
soon as prince john should throw down his leading staff, or truncheon;
another precaution usually taken to prevent the unnecessary effusion
of blood by the too long endurance of a sport so desperate. any knight
breaking the rules of the tournament, or otherwise transgressing the
rules of honourable chivalry, was liable to be stript of his arms, and,
having his shield reversed to be placed in that posture astride upon the
bars of the palisade, and exposed to public derision, in punishment of
his unknightly conduct.

ted, enabled him for a few minutes to keep at sword‚Äôs point his
three antagonists, turning and wheeling with the agility of a hawk upon
the wing, keeping his enemies as far separate as he could, and rushing
now against the one, now against the other, dealing sweeping blows with
his sword, without waiting to receive those which were aimed at him in
return.

but although the lists rang with the applauses of his dexterity, it
was evident that he must at last be overpowered; and the nobles around
prince john implored him with one voice to throw down his warder, and to
save so brave a knight from the disgrace of being overcome by odds.

‚Äúnot i, by the light of heaven!‚Äù answered prince john; ‚Äúthis
same springald, who conceals his name, and despises our proffered
hospitality, hath already gained one prize, and may now afford to
let others have their turn.‚Äù as he spoke thus, an unexpected incident
changed the fortune of the day.

there was among the ranks of the disinherited knight a champion i

leaving his leader to cope as he best could with brian de bois-guilbert.
this was no longer matter of so much difficulty as formerly. the
templars horse had bled much, and gave way under the shock of the
disinherited knight‚Äôs charge. brian de bois-guilbert rolled on the
field, encumbered with the stirrup, from which he was unable to draw his
foot. his antagonist sprung from horseback, waved his fatal sword over
the head of his adversary, and commanded him to yield himself; when
prince john, more moved by the templars dangerous situation than he had
been by that of his rival, saved him the mortification of confessing
himself vanquished, by casting down his warder, and putting an end to
the conflict.

it was, indeed, only the relics and embers of the fight which continued
to burn; for of the few knights who still continued in the lists, the
greater part had, by tacit consent, forborne the conflict for some time,
leaving it to be determined by the strife of the leaders.

the squires

gallantly contested tournaments of that age; for although only four
knights, including one who was smothered by the heat of his armour, had
died upon the field, yet upwards of thirty were desperately wounded,
four or five of whom never recovered. several more were disabled for
life; and those who escaped best carried the marks of the conflict to
the grave with them. hence it is always mentioned in the old records, as
the gentle and joyous passage of arms of ashby.

it being now the duty of prince john to name the knight who had done
best, he determined that the honour of the day remained with the knight
whom the popular voice had termed ‚Äúle noir faineant.‚Äù it was pointed out
to the prince, in impeachment of this decree, that the victory had been
in fact won by the disinherited knight, who, in the course of the
day, had overcome six champions with his own hand, and who had finally
unhorsed and struck down the leader of the opposite party. but prince
john adhered to his own opinion, on the

ent, however, the knight thus preferred was
nowhere to be found. he had left the lists immediately when the conflict
ceased, and had been observed by some spectators to move down one of
the forest glades with the same slow pace and listless and indifferent
manner which had procured him the epithet of the black sluggard. after
he had been summoned twice by sound of trumpet, and proclamation of
the heralds, it became necessary to name another to receive the honours
which had been assigned to him. prince john had now no further excuse
for resisting the claim of the disinherited knight, whom, therefore, he
named the champion of the day.

through a field slippery with blood, and encumbered with broken armour
and the bodies of slain and wounded horses, the marshals of the lists
again conducted the victor to the foot of prince john‚Äôs throne.

the world knew, was a town of the philistines, and entitled to none of
the privileges of the holy city.‚Äù

waldemar, whose curiosity had led him towards the place where ivanhoe
had fallen to the ground, now returned. ‚Äúthe gallant,‚Äù said he,
‚Äúis likely to give your highness little disturbance, and to leave
front-de-boeuf in the quiet possession of his gains--he is severely
wounded.‚Äù

‚Äúwhatever becomes of him,‚Äù said prince john, ‚Äúhe is victor of the day;
and were he tenfold our enemy, or the devoted friend of our brother,
which is perhaps the same, his wounds must be looked to--our own
physician shall attend him.‚Äù

a stern smile curled the prince‚Äôs lip as he spoke. waldemar fitzurse
hastened to reply, that ivanhoe was already removed from the lists, and
in the custody of his friends.

‚Äúi was somewhat afflicted,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúto see the grief of the queen of

but this same lady rowena suppressed her sorrow with such dignity of
manner, that it could only be discovered by her folded hands, and her
tearless eye, which trembled as it remained fixed on the lifeless form
before her.‚Äù

‚Äúwho is this lady rowena,‚Äù said prince john, ‚Äúof whom we have heard so
much?‚Äù

‚Äúa saxon heiress of large possessions,‚Äù replied the prior aymer; ‚Äúa rose
of loveliness, and a jewel of wealth; the fairest among a thousand, a
bundle of myrrh, and a cluster of camphire.‚Äù

‚Äúwe shall cheer her sorrows,‚Äù said prince john, ‚Äúand amend her blood, by
wedding her to a norman. she seems a minor, and must therefore be at our
royal disposal in marriage.--how sayst thou, de bracy? what thinkst thou
of gaining fair lands and livings, by

wedding a saxon, after the fashion
of the followers of the conqueror?‚Äù

‚Äúif the lands are to my liking, my lord,‚Äù answered de bracy, ‚Äúit will be
hard to displease me with a bride; and deeply will i hold myself bound
to your highness for a good deed, which will fulfil all promises made in
favour of your servant and vassal.‚Äù

‚Äúwe will not forget it,‚Äù said prince john; ‚Äúand that we may instantly go
to work, command our seneschal presently to order the attendance of the
lady rowena and her company--that is, the rude churl her guardian, and
the saxon ox whom the black knight struck down in the tournament, upon
this evening‚Äôs banquet.--de bigot,‚Äù he added to his seneschal, ‚Äúthou
wilt word this our second summons so courteously, as to gratify the
pride of these saxons, and make it impossible for them again to refuse;
although, by the bones of becket, cou

prince john had proceeded thus far, and was about to give the signal for
retiring from the lists, when a small billet was put into his hand.

‚Äúfrom whence?‚Äù said prince john, looking at the person by whom it was
delivered.

‚Äúfrom foreign parts, my lord, but from whence i know not‚Äù replied his
attendant. ‚Äúa frenchman brought it hither, who said, he had ridden night
and day to put it into the hands of your highness.‚Äù

the prince looked narrowly at the superscription, and then at the
seal, placed so as to secure the flex-silk with which the billet was
surrounded, and which bore the impression of three fleurs-de-lis.
john then opened the billet with apparent ag

first on the earth, and
then up to heaven, like a man who has received news that sentence of
execution has been passed upon him. recovering from the first effects of
his surprise, he took waldemar fitzurse and de bracy aside, and put
the billet into their hands successively. ‚Äúit means,‚Äù he added, in a
faltering voice, ‚Äúthat my brother richard has obtained his freedom.‚Äù

‚Äúthis may be a false alarm, or a forged letter,‚Äù said de bracy.

‚Äúit is france‚Äôs own hand and seal,‚Äù replied prince john.

‚Äúit is time, then,‚Äù said fitzurse, ‚Äúto draw our party to a head, either
at york, or some other centrical place. a few days later, and it will be
indeed too late. your highness must break short this present mummery.‚Äù

‚Äúthe yeomen and commons,‚Äù said de bracy, ‚Äúmust not be dismissed
discontented, for lack of their share in the sports.‚Äù

‚Äúthe day,‚Äù said waldemar, ‚Äúis not yet very far spent--let the archers
shoot a few rounds at the target, and the prize be adjudged. this wil

erned.‚Äù

‚Äúi thank thee, waldemar,‚Äù said the prince; ‚Äúthou remindest me, too, that
i have a debt to pay to that insolent peasant who yesterday insulted our
person. our banquet also shall go forward to-night as we proposed. were
this my last hour of power, it should be an hour sacred to revenge and
to pleasure--let new cares come with to-morrow‚Äôs new day.‚Äù

the sound of the trumpets soon recalled those spectators who had already
begun to leave the field; and proclamation was made that prince john,
suddenly called by high and peremptory public duties, held himself
obliged to discontinue the entertainments of to-morrow‚Äôs festival:
nevertheless, that, unwilling so many good yeoman should depart without
a trial of skill, he was pleased to appoint them, before leaving the
ground, presently to execute the competition of archery intended for
the morrow. to the best archer a prize was to be awarded, being a
bugle-horn, mounted with silver, and a silken baldric richly ornamented

edwood and charnwood. when, however, the archers understood with whom
they were to be matched, upwards of twenty withdrew themselves from the
contest, unwilling to encounter the dishonour of almost certain defeat.
for in those days the skill of each celebrated marksman was as well
known for many miles round him, as the qualities of a horse trained at
newmarket are familiar to those who frequent that well-known meeting.

the diminished list of competitors for silvan fame still amounted to
eight. prince john stepped from his royal seat to view more nearly the
persons of these chosen yeomen, several of whom wore the royal livery.
having satisfied his curiosity by this investigation, he looked for the
object of his resentment, whom he observed standing on the same spot,
and with the same composed countenance which he had exhibited upon the
preceding day.

‚Äúfellow,‚Äù said prince john, ‚Äúi guessed by thy insolent babble that thou
wert no true lover of the longbow, and i see thou darest not adventur

‚Äúunder favour, sir,‚Äù replied the yeoman, ‚Äúi have another reason for
refraining to shoot, besides the fearing discomfiture and disgrace.‚Äù

‚Äúand what is thy other reason?‚Äù said prince john, who, for some cause
which perhaps he could not himself have explained, felt a painful
curiosity respecting this individual.

‚Äúbecause,‚Äù replied the woodsman, ‚Äúi know not if these yeomen and i are
used to shoot at the same marks; and because, moreover, i know not how
your grace might relish the winning of a third prize by one who has
unwittingly fallen under your displeasure.‚Äù

prince john coloured as he put the question, ‚Äúwhat is thy name, yeoman?‚Äù

‚Äúlocksley,‚Äù answered the yeo

man.

‚Äúthen, locksley,‚Äù said prince john, ‚Äúthou shalt shoot in thy turn, when
these yeomen have displayed their skill. if thou carriest the prize,
i will add to it twenty nobles; but if thou losest it, thou shalt
be stript of thy lincoln green, and scourged out of the lists with
bowstrings, for a wordy and insolent braggart.‚Äù

‚Äúand how if i refuse to shoot on such a wager?‚Äù said the yeoman.--‚Äúyour
grace‚Äôs power, supported, as it is, by so many men-at-arms, may indeed
easily strip and scourge me, but cannot compel me to ben

u refusest my fair proffer,‚Äù said the prince, ‚Äúthe provost of the
lists shall cut thy bowstring, break thy bow and arrows, and expel thee
from the presence as a faint-hearted craven.‚Äù

‚Äúthis is no fair chance you put on me, proud prince,‚Äù said the yeoman,
‚Äúto compel me to peril myself against the best archers of leicester and
staffordshire, under the penalty of infamy if they should overshoot me.
nevertheless, i will obey your pleasure.‚Äù

‚Äúlook to him close, men-at-arms,‚Äù said prince john, ‚Äúhis heart is
sinking; i am jealous lest he attempt to escape the trial.--and do you,
good fellows, shoot boldly round; a buck and a butt of wine are ready
for your refreshment in yonder tent, when the prize is won.‚Äù

a target was placed at the upper end of the southern avenue which led
to the lists. the contending archers took their station in turn, at the
bottom of the southern access, the distance between that station and the
mark allowing full distance for what was called a shot at rov

nd the sports of the yeomanry.

one by one the archers, stepping forward, delivered their shafts
yeomanlike and bravely. of twenty-four arrows, shot in succession,
ten were fixed in the target, and the others ranged so near it, that,
considering the distance of the mark, it was accounted good archery. of
the ten shafts which hit the target, two within the inner ring were shot
by hubert, a forester in the service of malvoisin, who was accordingly
pronounced victorious.

‚Äúnow, locksley,‚Äù said prince john to the bold yeoman, with a bitter
smile, ‚Äúwilt thou try conclusions with hubert, or wilt thou yield up
bow, baldric, and quiver, to the provost of the sports?‚Äù

‚Äúsith it be no better,‚Äù said locksley, ‚Äúi am content to try my fortune;
on condition that when i have shot two shafts at yonder mark of
hubert‚Äôs, he shall be bound to shoot one at that which i shall propose.‚Äù

‚Äúthat is but fair,‚Äù answered prince john, ‚Äúand it shall not be refused
thee.--if thou dost beat this braggar

 said his antagonist,
bending his bow, ‚Äúor that had been a better shot.‚Äù

so saying, and without showing the least anxiety to pause upon his
aim, locksley stept to the appointed station, and shot his arrow as
carelessly in appearance as if he had not even looked at the mark. he
was speaking almost at the instant that the shaft left the bowstring,
yet it alighted in the target two inches nearer to the white spot which
marked the centre than that of hubert.

‚Äúby the light of heaven!‚Äù said prince john to hubert, ‚Äúan thou suffer
that runagate knave to overcome thee, thou art worthy of the gallows!‚Äù

hubert had but one set speech for all occasions. ‚Äúan your highness
were to hang me,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúa man can but do his best. nevertheless, my
grandsire drew a good bow--‚Äù

‚Äúthe foul fiend on thy grandsire and all his generation!‚Äù interrupted
john, ‚Äúshoot, knave, and shoot thy best, or it shall be the worse for
thee!‚Äù

thus exhorted, hubert resumed his place, and not neglecting the

Äù
 whispered the yeomen to each other; ‚Äúsuch archery was never seen since a
bow was first bent in britain.‚Äù

‚Äúand now,‚Äù said locksley, ‚Äúi will crave your grace‚Äôs permission to plant
such a mark as is used in the north country; and welcome every brave
yeoman who shall try a shot at it to win a smile from the bonny lass he
loves best.‚Äù

he then turned to leave the lists. ‚Äúlet your guards attend me,‚Äù he said,
‚Äúif you please--i go but to cut a rod from the next willow-bush.‚Äù

prince john made a signal that some attendants should follow him in
case of his escape: but the cry of ‚Äúshame! shame!‚Äù which burst from the
multitude, induced him to alter his ungenerous purpose.

locksley returned almost instantly with a willow wand about six feet in
length, perfectly straight, and rather thicker than a man‚Äôs thumb. he
began to peel this with great composure, observing at the same time,
that to ask a good woodsman to shoot at a target so broad as had
hitherto been used, was to put s

 good bow at the battle of hastings,
and never shot at such a mark in his life--and neither will i. if this
yeoman can cleave that rod, i give him the bucklers--or rather, i yield
to the devil that is in his jerkin, and not to any human skill; a man
can but do his best, and i will not shoot where i am sure to miss. i
might as well shoot at the edge of our parson‚Äôs whittle, or at a wheat
straw, or at a sunbeam, as at a twinkling white streak which i can
hardly see.‚Äù

‚Äúcowardly dog!‚Äù said prince john.--‚Äúsirrah locksley, do thou shoot; but,
if thou hittest such a mark, i will say thou art the first man ever
did so. however it be, thou shalt not crow over us with a mere show of
superior skill.‚Äù

‚Äúi will do my best, as hubert says,‚Äù answered locksley; ‚Äúno man can do
more.‚Äù

so saying, he again bent his bow, but on the present occasion looked
with attention to his weapon, and changed the string, which he thought
was no longer truly round, having been a little frayed by the two forme

r
shots. he then took his aim with some deliberation, and the multitude
awaited the event in breathless silence. the archer vindicated their
opinion of his skill: his arrow split the willow rod against which it
was aimed. a jubilee of acclamations followed; and even prince john, in
admiration of locksley‚Äôs skill, lost for an instant his dislike to his
person. ‚Äúthese twenty nobles,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwhich, with the bugle, thou
hast fairly won, are thine own; we will make them fifty, if thou wilt
take livery and service with us as a yeoman of our body guard, and be
near to our person. for never did so strong a hand bend a bow, or so
true an eye direct a shaft.‚Äù

so saying, the prince resumed his horse, and returned to ashby, the

prince john held his high festival in the castle of ashby. this was
not the same building of which the stately ruins still interest the
traveller, and which was erected at a later period by the lord hastings,
high chamberlain of england, one of the first victims of the tyranny
of richard the third, and yet better known as one of shakspeare‚Äôs
characters than by his historical fame. the castle and town of ashby, at
this time, belonged to roger de quincy, earl of winchester, who, during

story, was absent in the holy land. prince john, in
the meanwhile, occupied his castle, and disposed of his domains without
scruple; and seeking at present to dazzle men‚Äôs eyes by his hospitality
and magnificence, had given orders for great preparations, in order to
render the banquet as splendid as possible.

the purveyors of the prince, who exercised on this and other occasions
the full authority of royalty, had swept the country of all that could
be collected which was esteemed fit for their master‚Äôs table. guests
also were invited in

 great numbers; and in the necessity in which he
then found himself of courting popularity, prince john had extended his
invitation to a few distinguished saxon and danish families, as well as
to the norman nobility and gentry of the neighbourhood. however
despised and degraded on ordinary occasions, the great numbers of
the anglo-saxons must necessarily render them formidable in the civil
commotions which seemed approaching, and it was an obvious point of
policy to secure popularity with their leaders.

it was accordingly the prince‚Äôs intention, which he for some time
maintained, to treat thes

s petulant attendants could not resist the
temptation of pulling the long beards of the irish chieftains; a
conduct which, as might have been expected, was highly resented by these
insulted dignitaries, and produced fatal consequences to the english
domination in ireland. it is necessary to keep these inconsistencies
of john‚Äôs character in view, that the reader may understand his conduct
during the present evening.

in execution of the resolution which he had formed during his cooler
moments, prince john received cedric and athelstane with distinguished
courtesy, and expressed his disappointment, without resentment, when the
indisposition of rowena was alleged by the former as a reason for her
not attending upon his gracious summons. cedric and athelstane were both
dressed in the ancient saxon garb, which, although not unhandsome in
itself, and in the present instance composed of costly materials, was
so remote in shape and appearance from that of the other guests, that
prince john took great c

this garment. ‚Äúin heaven‚Äôs name,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúto what purpose serve these
abridged cloaks? if we are in bed they are no cover, on horseback they
are no protection from the wind and rain, and when seated, they do not
guard our legs from the damp or the frost.‚Äù

nevertheless, spite of this imperial objurgation, the short cloaks
continued in fashion down to the time of which we treat, and
particularly among the princes of the house of anjou. they were
therefore in universal use among prince john‚Äôs courtiers; and the
long mantle, which formed the upper garment of the saxons, was held in
proportional derision.

the guests were seated at a table which groaned under the quantity of
good cheer. the numerous cooks who attended on the prince‚Äôs progress,
having exerted all their art in varying the forms in which the ordinary
provisions were served up, had succeeded almost as well as the modern
professors of the culinary art in rendering them perfectly unlike their
natural appearance. besid

 as well as of the simnel-bread and wastle cakes, which were only
used at the tables of the highest nobility. the banquet was crowned with
the richest wines, both foreign and domestic.

but, though luxurious, the norman nobles were not generally speaking
an intemperate race. while indulging themselves in the pleasures of
the table, they aimed at delicacy, but avoided excess, and were apt to
attribute gluttony and drunkenness to the vanquished saxons, as vices
peculiar to their inferior station. prince john, indeed, and those who
courted his pleasure by imitating his foibles, were apt to indulge to
excess in the pleasures of the trencher and the goblet; and indeed it is
well known that his death was occasioned by a surfeit upon peaches and
new ale. his conduct, however, was an exception to the general manners
of his countrymen.

with sly gravity, interrupted only by private signs to each other, the
norman knights and nobles beheld the ruder demeanour of athelstane
and cedric at a banquet, to the f

been more justly bestowed on his gluttony.

the long feast had at length its end; and, while the goblet circulated
freely, men talked of the feats of the preceding tournament,--of
the unknown victor in the archery games, of the black knight, whose
self-denial had induced him to withdraw from the honours he had
won,--and of the gallant ivanhoe, who had so dearly bought the honours
of the day. the topics were treated with military frankness, and the
jest and laugh went round the hall. the brow of prince john alone was
overclouded during these discussions; some overpowering care seemed
agitating his mind, and it was only when he received occasional hints
from his attendants, that he seemed to take interest in what was passing
around him. on such occasions he would start up, quaff a cup of wine
as if to raise his spirits, and then mingle in the conversation by some
observation made abruptly or at random.

‚Äúwe drink this beaker,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúto the health of wilfred of ivanhoe,

absent from our board--let all fill to the pledge, and especially cedric
of rotherwood, the worthy father of a son so promising.‚Äù

‚Äúno, my lord,‚Äù replied cedric, standing up, and placing on the table his
untasted cup, ‚Äúi yield not the name of son to the disobedient youth, who
at once despises my commands, and relinquishes the manners and customs
of his fathers.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Äòtis impossible,‚Äù cried prince john, with well-feigned astonishment,
‚Äúthat so gallant a knight should be an unworthy or disobedient son!‚Äù

‚Äúyet, my lord,‚Äù answered cedric, ‚Äúso it is with this wilfred. he left my
homely dwelling to mingle with the gay nobility of your brother‚Äôs court,
where he learned to do those tricks of horsemanship which you prize so
highly. he left it contrary to my wish and command; and in the days
of alfred that would have been termed disobedience--ay, and a crime
severely punishable.‚Äù

s!‚Äù replied prince john, with a deep sigh of affected sympathy,
‚Äúsince your son was a follower of my unhappy brother, it need not
be enquired where or from whom he learned the lesson of filial
disobedience.‚Äù

thus spake prince john, wilfully forgetting, that of all the sons of
henry the second, though no one was free from the charge, he himself had
been most distinguished for rebellion and ingratitude to his father.

‚Äúi think,‚Äù said he, after a moment‚Äôs pause, ‚Äúthat my brother proposed to
confer upon his favourite the rich manor of ivanhoe.‚Äù

‚Äúhe did endow him with it,‚Äù answered cedric; ‚Äúnor is it my least quarrel
with my son, that he stooped to hold, as a feudal vassal, the very

‚Äúwhoever shall call thee saxon, sir baron,‚Äù replied cedric, offended
at a mode of expression by which the normans frequently expressed their
habitual contempt of the english, ‚Äúwill do thee an honour as great as it
is undeserved.‚Äù

front-de-boeuf would have replied, but prince john‚Äôs petulance and
levity got the start.

‚Äúassuredly,‚Äù said be, ‚Äúmy lords, the noble cedric speaks truth; and

pedigrees as in the longitude of their cloaks.‚Äù

‚Äúthey go before us indeed in the field--as deer before dogs,‚Äù said
malvoisin.

followed their prince‚Äôs example, and aimed a shaft of ridicule at
cedric, the face of the saxon became inflamed with passion, and
he glanced his eyes fiercely from one to another, as if the quick
succession of so many injuries had prevented his replying to them in
turn; or, like a baited bull, who, surrounded by his tormentors, is at
a loss to choose from among them the immediate object of his revenge.
at length he spoke, in a voice half choked with passion; and, addressing
himself to prince john as the head and front of the offence which he had
received, ‚Äúwhatever,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúhave been the follies and vices of our
race, a saxon would have been held ‚Äònidering‚Äô,‚Äù [21] (the most emphatic
term for abject worthlessness,) ‚Äúwho should in his own hall, and while

ast be silent,‚Äù here he looked at front-de-boeuf and the
templar, ‚Äúwho have within these few hours once and again lost saddle and
stirrup before the lance of a saxon.‚Äù

‚Äúby my faith, a biting jest!‚Äù said prince john. ‚Äúhow like you it,
sirs?--our saxon subjects rise in spirit and courage; become shrewd
in wit, and bold in bearing, in these unsettled times--what say ye,
my lords?--by this good light, i hold it best to take our galleys, and
return to normandy in time.‚Äù

‚Äúfor fear of the saxons?‚Äù said de bracy, laughing; ‚Äúwe should need no
weapon but our hunting spears to bring these boars to bay.‚Äù

‚Äúa truce with your raillery, sir knights,‚Äù said fitzurse;--‚Äúand it

ressing the prince, ‚Äúthat your highness should
assure the worthy cedric there is no insult intended him by jests, which
must sound but harshly in the ear of a stranger.‚Äù

‚Äúinsult?‚Äù answered prince john, resuming his courtesy of demeanour; ‚Äúi
trust it will not be thought that i could mean, or permit any, to be
offered in my presence. here! i fill my cup to cedric himself, since he
refuses to pledge his son‚Äôs health.‚Äù

the cup went round amid the well-dissembled applause of the courtiers,
which, however, failed to make the impression on the mind of the saxon
that had been designed. he was not naturally acute of perception,
but those too much undervalued his understanding who deemed that t

his
flattering compliment would obliterate the sense of the prior insult. he
was silent, however, when the royal pledge again passed round, ‚Äúto sir
athelstane of coningsburgh.‚Äù

the knight made his obeisance, and showed his sense of the honour by
draining a huge goblet in answer to it.

‚Äúand now, sirs,‚Äù said prince john, who began to be warmed with the wine
which he had drank, ‚Äúhaving done justice to our saxon guests, we
will pray of them some requital to our courtesy.--worthy thane,‚Äù he
continued, addressing cedric, ‚Äúmay we pray you to name to us some norman
whose mention may least sully your mouth, and to wash down with a goblet
of wine all bitterness which the sound may leave behind it?‚Äù

fitzurse arose while prince john spoke, and gliding behind the seat of
the saxon, whispered to him not to omit t

he opportunity of putting an
end to unkindness betwixt the two races, by naming prince john. the
saxon replied not to this politic insinuation, but, rising up, and
filling his cup to the brim, he addressed prince john in these words:
‚Äúyour highness has required that i should name a norman deserving to
be remembered at our banquet. this, perchance, is a hard task, since
it calls on the slave to sing the praises of the master--upon the
vanquished, while pressed by all the evils of conquest, to sing the
praises of the conqueror. yet i will name a norman--the first in arms
and in place--the best and the noblest of his race. and the lips that

goblet to the health of richard the lion-hearted!‚Äù

prince john, who had expected that his own name would have closed
the saxon‚Äôs speech, started when that of his injured brother was so
unexpectedly introduced. he raised mechanically the wine-cup to his
lips, then instantly set it down, to view the demeanour of the company
at this unexpected proposal, which many of them felt it as unsafe
to oppose as to comply with. some of them, ancient and experienced
courtiers, closely imitated the example of the prince himself, raising
the goblet to their lips, and ag

g, exclaimed, ‚Äúlong live king
richard! and may he be speedily restored to us!‚Äù and some few, among
whom were front-de-boeuf and the templar, in sullen disdain suffered
their goblets to stand untasted before them. but no man ventured
directly to gainsay a pledge filled to the health of the reigning
monarch.

having enjoyed his triumph for about a minute, cedric said to his
companion, ‚Äúup, noble athelstane! we have remained here long enough,
since we have requited the hospitable courtesy of prince john‚Äôs banquet.
those who wish to know further of our rude saxon manners must henceforth
seek us in the homes of our fathers, since we have seen enough of royal
banquets, and enough of norman courtesy.‚Äù

so saying, he arose and left the banqueting room, followed by
athelstane, and by several other guests, who, partaking of the saxon
lineage, held themselves insulted by the sarcasms of prince john and his
courtiers.

‚Äúfear not, my lord,‚Äù said waldemar; ‚Äúi will show him such reasons as
shall induce him to join us when we hold our meeting at york.--sir

your palfrey.‚Äù

the other guests were now fast dispersing, with the exception of those
immediately attached to prince john‚Äôs faction, and his retinue.

‚Äúthis, then, is the result of your advice,‚Äù said the prince, turning
an angry countenance upon fitzurse; ‚Äúthat i should be bearded at my
own board by a drunken saxon churl, and that, on the mere sound of my
brother‚Äôs name, men should fall off from me as if i had the leprosy?‚Äù

‚Äúhave patience, sir,‚Äù replied his counsellor; ‚Äúi might retort your
accusation, and blame the inconsiderate levity which foiled my

wine he had drank partly contributed--‚Äúit will be in vain--they have

no spider ever took more pains to repair the shattered meshes of his
web, than did waldemar fitzurse to reunite and combine the scattered
members of prince john‚Äôs cabal. few of these were attached to him from
inclination, and none from personal regard. it was therefore necessary,
that fitzurse should open to them new prospects of advantage, and remind
them of those which they at present enjoyed. to the young and wild
nobles, he held out the prospect of unpunished license and uncontrolled
revelry; to the ambitious, that of power, and to the covetous, that of
increased wealth and extended domains. the leaders of the mercenaries

during his absence, have done aught that can be construed offence or

the crown. he returns to avenge upon the orders of the temple and the
hospital, the preference which they showed to philip of france during
the wars in the holy land. he returns, in fine, to punish as a rebel
every adherent of his brother prince john. are ye afraid of his power?‚Äù
 continued the artful confident of that prince, ‚Äúwe acknowledge him a
strong and valiant knight; but these are not the days of king arthur,
when a champion could encounter an army. if richard indeed comes back,
it must be alone,--unfollowed--unfriended. the bones of his gallant army

returned have straggled hither like this wilfred of ivanhoe, beggared

and miserable prisoner in the castle of cardiff, because he opposed
himself to the will of the people, who chose that he should not rule
over them. it is our right,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúto choose from the blood royal
the prince who is best qualified to hold the supreme power--that is,‚Äù
 said he, correcting himself, ‚Äúhim whose election will best promote the
interests of the nobility. in personal qualifications,‚Äù he added, ‚Äúit
was possible that prince john might be inferior to his brother richard;
but when it was considered that the latter returned with the sword of
vengeance in his hand, while the former held out rewards, immunities,
privileges, wealth, and honours, it could not be doubted which was the
king whom in wisdom the nobility were called on to support.‚Äù

these, and many more arguments, some adapted to the peculiar
circumstances of those whom he addressed, had the expected weight with
the nobles of prince john‚Äôs faction. most of the

it was late at night, when, worn out and exhausted with his various
exertions, however gratified with the result, fitzurse, returning to
the castle of ashby, met with de bracy, who had exchanged his banqueting
garments for a short green kirtle, with hose of the same cloth and
colour, a leathern cap or head-piece, a short sword, a horn slung over
his shoulder, a long bow in his hand, and a bundle of arrows stuck in
his belt. had fitzurse met this figure in an outer apartment, he would

sed him without notice, as one of the yeomen of the guard; but
finding him in the inner hall, he looked at him with more attention, and
recognised the norman knight in the dress of an english yeoman.

‚Äúwhat mummery is this, de bracy?‚Äù said fitzurse, somewhat angrily; ‚Äúis
this a time for christmas gambols and quaint maskings, when the fate of
our master, prince john, is on the very verge of decision? why hast thou
not been, like me, among these heartless cravens, whom the very name
of king richard terrifies, as it is said to do the children of the
saracens?‚Äù

‚Äúi have been attending to mine own business,‚Äù answered de bracy calmly,
‚Äúas you, fitzurse, have been minding yours.‚Äù

he is too weak to be a determined monarch, too tyrannical to be an easy
monarch, too insolent and presumptuous to be a popular monarch, and too
fickle and timid to be long a monarch of any kind. but he is a monarch
by whom fitzurse and de bracy hope to rise and thrive; and therefore you

‚Äúart thou mad, de bracy?‚Äù said fitzurse. ‚Äúbethink thee that, though the
men be saxons, they are rich and powerful, and regarded with the more
respect by their countrymen, that wealth and honour are but the lot of
few of saxon descent.‚Äù

‚Äúand should belong to none,‚Äù said de bracy; ‚Äúthe work of the conquest
should be completed.‚Äù

‚Äúthis is no time for it at least,‚Äù said fitzurse ‚Äúthe approaching crisis
renders the favour of the multitude indispensable, and prince john
cannot refuse justice to any one who injures their favourites.‚Äù

‚Äúlet him grant it, if he dare,‚Äù said de bracy; ‚Äúhe will soon see the
difference betwixt the support of such a lusty lot of spears as mine,
and that of a heartless mob of saxon churls. yet i mean no immediate
discovery of myself. seem i not in this garb as bold a forester as ever

his commands were obeyed; and, upon entering that gothic apartment, hung
with many spoils won by his own valour and that of his father, he found
a flagon of wine on the massive oaken table, and the two saxon captives
under the guard of four of his dependants. front-de-boeuf took a long

the blood which ivanhoe had lost did not prevent a flush from crossing
his cheek, feeling that he had incautiously betrayed a deep interest in
rowena by the awkward attempt he had made to conceal it.

     --king john

there was brave feasting in the castle of york, to which prince john
had invited those nobles, prelates, and leaders, by whose assistance he
hoped to carry through his ambitious projects upon his brother‚Äôs throne.
waldemar fitzurse, his able and politic agent, was at secret work among
them, tempering all to that pitch of courage which was necessary in
making an open declaration of their purpose. but their enterprise was
delayed by the absence of more than one main limb of the confederacy.
the stubborn and daring, though brutal courage of front-de-boeuf; the
bu

oyant spirits and bold bearing of de bracy; the sagacity, martial
experience, and renowned valour of brian de bois-guilbert, were
important to the success of their conspiracy; and, while cursing in
secret their unnecessary and unmeaning absence, neither john nor his
adviser dared to proceed without them. isaac the jew also seemed to have
vanished, and with him the hope of certain sums of money, making up the
subsidy for which prince john had contracted with that israelite and his
brethren. this deficiency was likely to prove perilous in an emergency
so critical.

it was on the morning after the fall of torquilstone, that a confused
report began to spread abroad in the city of york, that de bracy and
bois-guilbert, with their confederate front-de-boeuf, had been taken or
slain. waldemar brought the rumour to prince john, announcing, that he
feared its truth the more that they had set out with a small attendance,

the habit of infringing. we shall be finely helped, if the churl
saxons should have realized your grace‚Äôs vision, of converting feudal
drawbridges into gibbets; and yonder bold-spirited cedric seemeth one to
whom such an imagination might occur. your grace is well aware, it will
be dangerous to stir without front-de-boeuf, de bracy, and the templar;
and yet we have gone too far to recede with safety.‚Äù

prince john struck his forehead with impatience, and then began to
stride up and down the apartment.

‚Äúthe villains,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthe base treacherous villains, to desert me at
this pinch!‚Äù

‚Äúnay, say rather the feather-pated giddy madmen,‚Äù said waldemar, ‚Äúwho
must be toying with follies when such business was in hand.‚Äù

‚Äúwhat is to be done?‚Äù said the prince, stopping short before waldemar.

‚Äúi know nothing which can be done,‚Äù answered his counsellor, ‚Äúsave that
which i have already

e, until i had done my best to remedy it.‚Äù

‚Äúthou art ever my better angel, waldemar,‚Äù said the prince; ‚Äúand when
i have such a chancellor to advise withal, the reign of john will be
renowned in our annals.--what hast thou commanded?‚Äù

‚Äúi have ordered louis winkelbrand, de bracy‚Äôs lieutenant, to cause his
trumpet sound to horse, and to display his banner, and to set presently
forth towards the castle of front-de-boeuf, to do what yet may be done
for the succour of our friends.‚Äù

prince john‚Äôs face flushed with the pride of a spoilt child, who has
undergone what it conceives to be an insult. ‚Äúby the face of god!‚Äù
 he said, ‚Äúwaldemar fitzurse, much hast thou taken upon thee! and over

himself, by the rood!--and in strange guise doth he come before us.‚Äù

it was indeed de bracy--‚Äúbloody with spurring, fiery red with speed.‚Äù
 his armour bore all the marks of the late obstinate fray, being broken,
defaced, and stained with blood in many places, and covered with clay
and dust from the crest to the spur. undoing his helmet, he placed it
on the table, and stood a moment as if to collect himself before he told
his news.

‚Äúde bracy,‚Äù said prince john, ‚Äúwhat means this?--speak, i charge
thee!--are the saxons in rebellion?‚Äù

‚Äúspeak, de bracy,‚Äù said fitzurse, almost in the same moment with his
master, ‚Äúthou wert wont to be a man--where is the templar?--where
front-de-boeuf?‚Äù

‚Äúthe templar is fled,‚Äù said de bracy; ‚Äúfront-de-boeuf you will never
see more. he has found a red grave among the blazing rafters of his own
castle and i alone am escaped to tell you.‚Äù

 and
conflagration.‚Äù

‚Äúthe worst news is not yet said,‚Äù answered de bracy; and, coming up
to prince john, he uttered in a low and emphatic tone--‚Äúrichard is in
england--i have seen and spoken with him.‚Äù

prince john turned pale, tottered, and caught at the back of an oaken
bench to support himself--much like to a man who receives an arrow in
his bosom.

‚Äúthou ravest, de bracy,‚Äù said fitzurse, ‚Äúit cannot be.‚Äù

‚Äúit is as true as truth itself,‚Äù said de bracy; ‚Äúi was his prisoner, and
spoke with him.‚Äù

‚Äúwith richard plantagenet, sayest thou?‚Äù continued fitzurse.

‚Äúwith richard plantagenet,‚Äù replied de bracy, ‚Äúwith richard
coeur-de-lion--with richard of england.‚Äù

‚Äúand thou wert hi

t. and thou, waldemar, wilt thou take lance and shield, and lay
down thy policies, and wend along with me, and share the fate which god
sends us?‚Äù

‚Äúi am too old, maurice, and i have a daughter,‚Äù answered waldemar.

‚Äúgive her to me, fitzurse, and i will maintain her as fits her rank,
with the help of lance and stirrup,‚Äù said de bracy.

‚Äúnot so,‚Äù answered fitzurse; ‚Äúi will take sanctuary in this church of
saint peter--the archbishop is my sworn brother.‚Äù

during this discourse, prince john had gradually awakened from the
stupor into which he had been thrown by the unexpected intelligence,
and had been attentive to the conversation which passed betwixt his
followers. ‚Äúthey fall off from me,‚Äù he said to himself, ‚Äúthey hold no
more by me than a withered leaf by the bough when a breeze blows on
it!--hell and fiends! can i shape no means for myself when i am deserted
by these cravens?‚Äù--he paused, and there was an expression of diabolical
passion in the constrained laugh with

be won by one bold cast!‚Äù

‚Äúi understand you not,‚Äù said de bracy. ‚Äúas soon as richard‚Äôs return is
blown abroad, he will be at the head of an army, and all is then over
with us. i would counsel you, my lord, either to fly to france or take
the protection of the queen mother.‚Äù

‚Äúi seek no safety for myself,‚Äù said prince john, haughtily; ‚Äúthat i
could secure by a word spoken to my brother. but although you, de bracy,
and you, waldemar fitzurse, are so ready to abandon me, i should not
greatly delight to see your heads blackening on clifford‚Äôs gate yonder.

fitzurse and de bracy looked in each other‚Äôs faces with blank
dismay.--‚Äúthere is but one road to safety,‚Äù continued the prince, and
his brow grew black as midnight; ‚Äúthis object of our terror journeys
alone--he must be met withal.‚Äù

‚Äúnot by me,‚Äù said de bracy, hastily; ‚Äúi was his prisoner, and he took me
to mercy. i will not harm a feather in his crest.‚Äù

‚Äúwho spoke of harming him?‚Äù said prince john, with a hardened laugh;
‚Äúthe knave will say next that i meant he should slay him!--no--a prison
were better; and whether in britain or austria, what matters it?--things
will be but as they were when we commenced our enterprise--it was
founded on the hope that richard would remain a captive in germany--our
uncle robert lived and died in the castle of cardiffe.‚Äù

scruples of valiant de bracy; i trust i shall soon remove them.‚Äù

‚Äúthat passes your eloquence, fitzurse,‚Äù replied the knight.

‚Äúay, but i promise you,‚Äù said de bracy, ‚Äúthat neither tristram nor
lancelot would have been match, hand to hand, for richard plantagenet,
and i think it was not their wont to take odds against a single man.‚Äù

‚Äúthou art mad, de bracy--what is it we propose to thee, a hired and
retained captain of free companions, whose swords are purchased for
prince john‚Äôs service? thou art apprized of our enemy, and then thou
scruplest, though thy patron‚Äôs fortunes, those of thy comrades, thine
own, and the life and honour of every one amongst us, be at stake!‚Äù

‚Äúi tell you,‚Äù said de bracy, sullenly, ‚Äúthat he gave me my life. true,
he sent me from his presence, and refused my homage--so far i owe him
neither favour nor allegiance--but i will not lift hand against him.‚Äù

‚Äúit needs not--send louis winkelbrand and a score of thy lances.‚Äù

‚Äúart thou so obstinate, de bracy?‚Äù said prince john; ‚Äúand wilt thou
forsake me, after so many protestations of zeal for my service?‚Äù

‚Äúi mean it not,‚Äù said de bracy; ‚Äúi will abide by you in aught that
becomes a knight, whether in the lists or in the camp; but this highway
practice comes not within my vow.‚Äù

‚Äúcome hither, waldemar,‚Äù said prince john. ‚Äúan unhappy prince am i. my
father, king henry, had faithful servants--he had but to say that he was
plagued with a factious priest, and the blood of thomas-a-becket, saint
though he was, stained the steps of his own altar.--tracy, morville,
brito [47] loyal and daring subjects, your names, your spirit, are
extinct! and although reginald fitzurse hath left a son, he hath fallen
off from his father‚Äôs fidelity and courage.‚Äù

of saints, than put spear in rest against coeur-de-lion.--de bracy, to
thee i must trust to keep up the spirits of the doubtful, and to guard

apartment. ‚Äúhe goes to make my brother prisoner,‚Äù said prince john to

liberty of a saxon franklin. i trust he will observe our orders, and use

de bracy only answered by a smile.

‚Äúby the light of our lady‚Äôs brow,‚Äù said prince john, ‚Äúour orders to
him were most precise--though it may be you heard them not, as we stood
together in the oriel window--most clear and positive was our charge
that richard‚Äôs safety should be cared for, and woe to waldemar‚Äôs head if
he transgress it!‚Äù

‚Äúi had better pass to his lodgings,‚Äù said de bracy, ‚Äúand make him fully
aware of your grace‚Äôs pleasure; for, as it quite escaped my ear, it may
not perchance have reached that of waldemar.‚Äù

prince; ‚Äúevil luck have they who trust thee. thy chancellor, indeed!--he

trow. but high marshal of england! that,‚Äù he said, extending his arm, as
if to grasp the baton of office, and assuming a loftier stride along the
antechamber, ‚Äúthat is indeed a prize worth playing for!‚Äù

de bracy had no sooner left the apartment than prince john summoned an
attendant.

‚Äúbid hugh bardon, our scout-master, come hither, as soon as he shall
have spoken with waldemar fitzurse.‚Äù

the scout-master arrived after a brief delay, during which john
traversed the apartment with, unequal and disordered steps.

‚Äúbardon,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúwhat did waldemar desire of thee?‚Äù

‚Äútwo resolute men, well acquainted with these northern wilds, and
skilful in tracking the tread of man and horse.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Äòtis well,‚Äù said the prince.--‚Äúgoes waldemar forth with them?‚Äù

‚Äúinstantly,‚Äù said bardon.

‚Äúwith what attendance?‚Äù asked john, carelessly.

‚Äúbroad thoresby goes with him, and wetheral, whom they call, for his
cruelty, stephen steel-heart; and three northern men-at-arms that
belonged to ralph middleton‚Äôs gang--they are called the spears of
spyinghow.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Äòtis well,‚Äù said prince john; then added, after a moment‚Äôs pause,
‚Äúbardon, it imports our service that thou keep a strict watch on maurice
de bracy--so that he shall not observe it, however--and let us know
of his motions from time to time--with whom he converses, what he
proposeth. fail not in this, as thou wilt be answerable.‚Äù

hugh bardon bowed, and retired.

‚Äúthink not of such foolishness, sir knight,‚Äù answered rebecca, ‚Äúbut

the earl smiled and shook his head.

some of the
subordinate members of the conspiracy, though he has pardoned their
principal.‚Äù

from the judicial investigations which followed on this occasion, and
which are given at length in the wardour manuscript, it appears that
maurice de bracy escaped beyond seas, and went into the service of
philip of france; while philip de malvoisin, and his brother albert, the
preceptor of templestowe, were executed, although waldemar fitzurse, the
soul of the conspiracy, escaped with banishment; and prince john,
for whose behoof it was undertaken, was not even censured by his
good-natured brother. no one, however, pitied the fate of the two
malvoisins, who only suffered the death which they had both well
deserved, by many acts of falsehood, cruelty, and oppression.

briefly after the judicial combat, cedric the saxon was summoned to the
court of richard, which, for the purpose of quieting the counties that
had been disturbed by the ambition of his brother, was then held at
york. cedric tushed and psha
