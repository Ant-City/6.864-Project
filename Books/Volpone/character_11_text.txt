above the rest, seek to engross me whole,
     and counter-work the one unto the other,
     contend in gifts, as they would seem in love:
     all which i suffer, playing with their hopes,
     and am content to coin them into profit,
     to look upon their kindness, and take more,
     and look on that; still bearing them in hand,
     letting the cherry knock against their lips,
     and draw it by their mouths, and back again.--
     how now!

     [re-enter mosca with nano, androgyno, and castrone.]

     nan: now, room for fresh gamesters, who do will you to know,
     they do bring you neither play, nor university show;
     and therefore do entreat you, that whatsoever they rehearse,
     may not fare a whit the worse, for the false pace of the verse.
     if you wonder at this, you will wonder more ere we pass,
     for know, here is inclosed the soul of pythagoras,
     that juggler divine, as hereafter shall follow;
     which soul, fast and loose, sir, came first from apollo,

 blessed:
     for all other forms i have proved most distressed.

     nan: spoke true, as thou wert in pythagoras still.
     this learned opinion we celebrate will,
     fellow eunuch, as behoves us, with all our wit and art,
     to dignify that whereof ourselves are so great and special a part.

     volp: now, very, very pretty! mosca, this
     was thy invention?

     mos: if it please my patron,
     not else.

     volp: it doth, good mosca.

     mos: then it was, sir.

     nano and castrone [sing.]: fools, they are the only nation
     worth men's envy, or admiration:
     free from care or sorrow-taking,
     selves and others merry making:
     all they speak or do is sterling.
     your fool he is your great man's darling,
     and your ladies' sport and pleasure;
     tongue and bauble are his treasure.
     e'en his face begetteth laughter,
     and he speaks truth free from slaughter;
     he's the grace of every feast,
     and sometimes the chiefest guest;
     hath his tr

encher and his stool,
     when wit waits upon the fool:
     o, who would not be
     he, he, he?

     [knocking without.]

     volp: who's that? away!
     [exeunt nano and castrone.]
     look, mosca. fool, begone!
     [exit androgyno.]

     mos: 'tis signior voltore, the advocate;
     i know him by his knock.

     volp: fetch me my gown,
     my furs and night-caps; say, my couch is changing,
     and let him entertain himself awhile
     without i' the gallery.
     [exit mosca.]
     now, now, my clients
     begin their visitation! vulture, kite,
     raven, and gorcrow, all my birds of prey,
     that think me turning carcase, now they come;

    mos: sir, if i do it not, draw your just sword,
     and score your vengeance on my front and face;
     mark me your villain: you have too much wrong,
     and i do suffer for you, sir. my heart
     weeps blood in anguish--

     bon: lead; i follow thee.

     [exeunt.]

     scene 3.2.

     a room in volpone's house.

     enter volpone.

     volp: mosca stays long, methinks. bring forth your sports,
     and help to make the wretched time more sweet.

     [enter nano, androgyno, and castrone.]

     nan: dwarf, fool, and eunuch, well met here we be.
     a question it were now, whether of us three,
     being all the known delicates of a rich man,
     in pleasing him, claim the precedency can?

     cas: i claim for myself.

     and: and so doth the fool.

     nan: 'tis foolish indeed: let me set you both to school.
     first for your dwarf, he's little and witty,
     and every thing, as it is little, is pretty;
     else why do men say to a creature of my shape,
     so soon

but before, sir: had you heard him first
     draw it to certain heads, then aggravate,
     then use his vehement figures--i look'd still
     when he would shift a shirt: and, doing this
     out of pure love, no hope of gain--

     volp: 'tis right.
     i cannot answer him, mosca, as i would,
     not yet; but for thy sake, at thy entreaty,
     i will begin, even now--to vex them all,
     this very instant.

     mos: good sir.

     volp: call the dwarf
     and eunuch forth.

     mos: castrone, nano!

     [enter castrone and nano.]

     nano: here.

     volp: shall we have a jig now?

     mos: what you please, sir.

     volp: go,
     straight give out about the streets, you two,
     that i am dead; do it with constancy,
     sadly, do you hear? impute it to the grief
     of this late slander.

     [exeunt cast. and nano.]

     mos: what do you mean, sir?

     volp: o,
     i shall have instantly my vulture, crow,
     raven, come flying hither, on the news,
     to peck fo

     no man can sever you.

     volp: good.

     mos: but what am i?

     volp: 'fore heaven, a brave clarissimo, thou becom'st it!
     pity thou wert not born one.

     mos [aside.]: if i hold
     my made one, 'twill be well.

     volp: i'll go and see
     what news first at the court.

     [exit.]

     mos: do so. my fox
     is out of his hole, and ere he shall re-enter,
     i'll make him languish in his borrow'd case,
     except he come to composition with me.--
     androgyno, castrone, nano!

     [enter androgyno, castrone and nano.]

     all: here.

     mos: go, recreate yourselves abroad; go sport.--
     [exeunt.]
     so, now i have the keys, and am possest.
     since he will needs be dead afore his time,
     i'll bury him, or gain by him: i am his heir,
     and so will keep me, till he share at least.
     to cozen him of all, were but a cheat
     well placed; no man would construe it a sin:
     let his sport pay for it, this is call'd the fox-trap.

     scene 5.7.

     a street.

     enter volpone.

     volp: to make a snare for mine own neck! and run
     my head into it, wilfully! with laughter!
     when i had newly 'scaped, was free, and clear,
     out of mere wantonness! o, the dull devil
     was in this brain of mine, when i devised it,
     and mosca gave it second; he must now
     help to sear up this vein, or we bleed dead.--
     [enter nano, androgyno, and castrone.]
     how now! who let you loose? whither go you now?
     what, to buy gingerbread? or to drown kitlings?

     nan: sir, master mosca call'd us out of doors,
     and bid us all go play, and took the keys.

     and: yes.

     volp: did master mosca take the keys? why so!
     i'm farther in. these are my fine conceits!
     i must be merry, with a mischief to me!
     what a vile wretch was i, that could not bear
     my fortune soberly? i must have my crotchets,
     and my conundrums! we
