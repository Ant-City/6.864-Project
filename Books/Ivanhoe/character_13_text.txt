the jacket he added a short cloak, which scarcely reached half way down
his thigh; it was of crimson cloth, though a good deal soiled, lined
with bright yellow; and as he could transfer it from one shoulder to the
other, or at his pleasure draw it all around him, its width, contrasted
with its want of longitude, formed a fantastic piece of drapery. he had
thin silver bracelets upon his arms, and on his neck a collar of the
same metal bearing the inscription, â€œwamba, the son of witless, is the
thrall of cedric of rotherwood.â€ this personage had the same sort of
sandals with his companion, but instead of the roll of leather thong,
his legs were cased in a sort of gaiters, of which one was red and the
other yellow. he was provided also with a cap, having around it more
than one bell, about the size of those attached to hawks, which jingled
as he turned his head to one side or other; and as he seldom remained a
minute in the same posture, the sound might be

the outward appearance of these two men formed scarce a stronger
contrast than their look and demeanour. that of the serf, or bondsman,
was sad and sullen; his aspect was bent on the ground with an appearance
of deep dejection, which might be almost construed into apathy, had
not the fire which occasionally sparkled in his red eye manifested that
there slumbered, under the appearance of sullen despondency, a sense of
oppression, and a disposition to resistance. the looks of wamba, on
the other hand, indicated, as usual with his class, a sort of vacant
curiosity, and fidgetty impatience of any posture of repose, together
with the utmost self-satisfaction respecting his own situation, and the
appearance which he made. the dialogue which they maintained between
them, was carried on in anglo-saxon, which, as we said before, was
universally spoken by the inferior classes, excepting the norman
soldiers, and the immediate personal dependants of the great feudal
nobles. but to

but which, in fact, from misapprehension of the swine-herdâ€™s signals,
ignorance of his own duty, or malice prepense, only drove them hither

unfriendship to my sovereign person and royal wardrobe; wherefore,

destiny, which, whether they meet with bands of travelling soldiers,
or of outlaws, or of wandering pilgrims, can be little else than to
be converted into normans before morning, to thy no small ease and
comfort.â€

â€œthe swine turned normans to my comfort!â€ quoth gurth; â€œexpound that
to me, wamba, for my brain is too dull, and my mind too vexed, to read
riddles.â€

â€œwhy, how call you those grunting brutes running about on their four
legs?â€ demanded wamba.

â€œswine, fool, swine,â€ said the herd, â€œevery fool knows that.â€

â€œand swine is good saxon,â€ said the jester; â€œbut how call you the sow
when she is flayed, and drawn, and quartered, and hung up by the heels,

â€œit is but too true doctrine, friend wamba, however it got into thy

â€œnay, i can tell you more,â€ said wamba, in the same tone; â€œthere is old

man; a fool cannot half so well help himself--but soft, whom have we
here?â€ he said, listening to the trampling of several horses which
became then audible.

â€œnever mind whom,â€ answered gurth, who had now got his herd before him,
and, with the aid of fangs, was driving them down one of the long dim
vistas which we have endeavoured to describe.

â€œnay, but i must see the riders,â€ answered wamba; â€œperhaps they are come
from fairy-land with a message from king oberon.â€

â€œa murrain take thee,â€ rejoined the swine-herd; â€œwilt thou talk of such
things, while a terrible storm of thunder and lightning is raging within
a few miles of us? hark, how the thunder rumbles! and for summer rain,
i never saw such broad downright flat drops fall out of the clouds; the
oaks, too, notwithstanding the calm weather, sob and creak with their
great boughs as if announcing a tempest. thou canst play

wamba seemed to feel the force of this appeal, and accompanied his
companion, who began his journey after catching up a long quarter-staff
which lay upon the grass beside him. this second eumaeus strode hastily
down the forest glade, driving before him, with the assistance of fangs,
the whole herd of his inharmonious charge.

     --chaucer.

notwithstanding the occasional exhortation and chiding of his companion,
the noise of the horsemenâ€™s feet continuing to approach, wamba could
not be prevented from lingering occasionally on the road, upon every
pretence which occurred; now catching from the hazel a cluster of
half-ripe nuts, and now turning his head to leer after a cottage maiden
who crossed their path. the horsemen, therefore, soon overtook them on
the road.

their numbers amounted to ten men, of whom the two who rode foremost
seemed to be persons of considerable importance, and the others
their attendants. it was not difficult to ascertain the condition and

scent; and their fine slender limbs, small fetlocks, thin manes, and
easy springy motion, formed a marked contrast with the large-jointed,
heavy horses, of which the race was cultivated in flanders and in
normandy, for mounting the men-at-arms of the period in all the panoply
of plate and mail; and which, placed by the side of those eastern
coursers, might have passed for a personification of substance and of
shadow.

the singular appearance of this cavalcade not only attracted the
curiosity of wamba, but excited even that of his less volatile
companion. the monk he instantly knew to be the prior of jorvaulx
abbey, well known for many miles around as a lover of the chase, of
the banquet, and, if fame did him not wrong, of other worldly pleasures
still more inconsistent with his monastic vows.

yet so loose were the ideas of the times respecting the conduct of the
clergy, whether secular or regular, that the prior aymer maintained a
fair character in the neighbourhood of his abbey. his free

ca, or mixed language, in which the norman and saxon
races conversed with each other, â€œif there be in this neighbourhood any
good man, who, for the love of god, and devotion to mother church,
will give two of her humblest servants, with their train, a nightâ€™s
hospitality and refreshment?â€

this he spoke with a tone of conscious importance, which formed a strong
contrast to the modest terms which he thought it proper to employ.

â€œtwo of the humblest servants of mother church!â€ repeated wamba to
himself,--but, fool as he was, taking care not to make his observation
audible; â€œi should like to see her seneschals, her chief butlers, and
other principal domestics!â€

after this internal commentary on the priorâ€™s speech, he raised his
eyes, and replied to the question which had been put.

â€œif the reverend fathers,â€ he said, â€œloved good cheer and soft lodging,
few miles of riding would carry them to the priory of brinxworth, where
their quality could not but secure them the mos

the prior shook his head at both proposals.

â€œmine honest friend,â€ said he, â€œif the jangling of thy bells had not
dizzied thine understanding, thou mightst know â€œclericus clericum non
decimatâ€; that is to say, we churchmen do not exhaust each otherâ€™s
hospitality, but rather require that of the laity, giving them thus
an opportunity to serve god in honouring and relieving his appointed
servants.â€

â€œit is true,â€ replied wamba, â€œthat i, being but an ass, am,
nevertheless, honoured to hear the bells as well as your reverenceâ€™s
mule; notwithstanding, i did conceive that the charity of mother church
and her servants might be said, with other charity, to begin at home.â€

â€œa truce to thine insolence, fellow,â€ said the armed rider, breaking in
on his prattle with a high and stern voice, â€œand tell us, if thou canst,
the road to--how callâ€™d you your franklin, prior aymer?â€

â€œcedric,â€ answered the prior; â

ge and revengeful scowl, and with a fierce,
yet hesitating motion, laid his hand on the haft of his knife; but the
interference of prior aymer, who pushed his mule betwixt his companion
and the swineherd, prevented the meditated violence.

â€œnay, by st mary, brother brian, you must not think you are now in
palestine, predominating over heathen turks and infidel saracens; we
islanders love not blows, save those of holy church, who chasteneth whom
she loveth.--tell me, good fellow,â€ said he to wamba, and seconded his
speech by a small piece of silver coin, â€œthe way to cedric the saxonâ€™s;
you cannot be ignorant of it, and it is your duty to direct the wanderer
even when his character is less sanctified than ours.â€

â€œin truth, venerable father,â€ answered the jester, â€œthe saracen head of
your right reverend companion has frightened out of mine the way home--i
am not sure i shall get there to-night myself.â€

or the recovery of the holy sepulchre; he is of the order of knights
templars, whom you may have heard of; he is half a monk, half a
soldier.â€

â€œif he is but half a monk,â€ said the jester, â€œhe should not be wholly
unreasonable with those whom he meets upon the road, even if they should
be in no hurry to answer questions that no way concern them.â€

â€œi forgive thy wit,â€ replied the abbot, â€œon condition thou wilt show me
the way to cedricâ€™s mansion.â€

â€œwell, then,â€ answered wamba, â€œyour reverences must hold on this path
till you come to a sunken cross, of which scarce a cubitâ€™s length
remains above ground; then take the path to the left, for there are
four which meet at sunken cross, and i trust your reverences will obtain
shelter before the storm comes on.â€

the abbot thanked his sage adviser; and the cavalcade, setting spurs to
their horses, rode on as men do who wish to reach their inn before the
bursting of a night-storm. as their horsesâ€™ hoofs died away, gu

â€œto the left, certainly, the left; i remember his pointing with his
wooden sword.â€

â€œay, but he held his sword in his left hand, and so pointed across his
body with it,â€ said the templar.

each maintained his opinion with sufficient obstinacy, as is usual in
all such cases; the attendants were appealed to, but they had not been
near enough to hear wambaâ€™s directions. at length brian remarked, what
had at first escaped him in the twilight; â€œhere is some one either
asleep, or lying dead at the foot of this cross--hugo, stir him with the
butt-end of thy lance.â€

this was no sooner done than the figure arose, exclaiming in good
french, â€œwhosoever thou art, it is discourteous in you to disturb my
thoughts.â€

â€œwe did but wish to ask you,â€ said the prior, â€œthe road to rotherwood,
the abode of cedric the saxon.â€

â€œi myself am bound

thither,â€ replied the stranger; â€œand if i had a
horse, i would be your guide, for the way is somewhat intricate, though
perfectly well known to me.â€

â€œthou shalt have both thanks and reward, my friend,â€ said the prior, â€œif
thou wilt bring us to cedricâ€™s in safety.â€

and he caused one of his attendants to mount his own led horse, and give
that upon which he had hitherto ridden to the stranger, who was to serve
for a guide.

their conductor pursued an opposite road from that which wamba had
recommended, for the purpose of misleading them. the path soon led
deeper into the woodland, and crossed more than one brook, the approach
to which was rendered perilous by the marshes through which it flowed;
but the stranger seemed to know, as if by instinct, the soundest ground
and the safest points of passage; and by dint of caution and attention,
brought the party safely into a wilder avenue than any they had yet
seen; and, pointing to a large low irregular building at the upper

outlaws, with whom the adjacent forest abounded, or by the violence
of some neighbouring baron, whose consciousness of strength made
him equally negligent of the laws of property. the matter was of
consequence, for great part of the domestic wealth of the saxon
proprietors consisted in numerous herds of swine, especially in
forest-land, where those animals easily found their food.

besides these subjects of anxiety, the saxon thane was impatient for the
presence of his favourite clown wamba, whose jests, such as they were,
served for a sort of seasoning to his evening meal, and to the deep
draughts of ale and wine with which he was in the habit of accompanying
it. add to all this, cedric had fasted since noon, and his usual supper
hour was long past, a cause of irritation common to country squires,
both in ancient and modern times. his displeasure was expressed in
broken sentences, partly muttered to himself, partly addressed to the
domestics who stood around; and particularly to

that my property has been swept off to save from starving the hungry
banditti, whom they cannot support but by theft and robbery. my faithful
slave is murdered, and my goods are taken for a prey--and wamba--where
is wamba? said not some one he had gone forth with gurth?â€

oswald replied in the affirmative.

â€œay? why this is better and better! he is carried off too, the saxon
fool, to serve the norman lord. fools are we all indeed that serve them,
and fitter subjects for their scorn and laughter, than if we were born
with but half our wits. but i will be avenged,â€ he added, starting from
his chair in impatience at the supposed injury, and catching hold of his

which comparisons between the two rival nations seldom failed to call
forth; but, recollecting the duties of hospitality, he suppressed
further show of resentment, and, motioning with his hand, caused his
guests to assume two seats a little lower than his own, but placed close
beside him, and gave a signal that the evening meal should be placed
upon the board.

while the attendants hastened to obey cedricâ€™s commands, his eye
distinguished gurth the swineherd, who, with his companion wamba, had
just entered the hall. â€œsend these loitering knaves up hither,â€ said the
saxon, impatiently. and when the culprits came before the dais,--â€œhow
comes it, villains! that you have loitered abroad so late as this? hast
thou brought home thy charge, sirrah gurth, or hast thou left them to
robbers and marauders?â€

â€œthe herd is safe, so please ye,â€ said gurth.

â€œbut it does not please me, thou knave,â€ said cedric, â€œthat i should be
made to suppose otherwise for two hours, and si

gurth, knowing his masterâ€™s irritable temper, attempted no exculpation;
but the jester, who could presume upon cedricâ€™s tolerance, by virtue
of his privileges as a fool, replied for them both; â€œin troth, uncle
cedric, you are neither wise nor reasonable to-night.â€

â€œâ€˜how, sir?â€ said his master; â€œyou shall to the porterâ€™s lodge, and
taste of the discipline there, if you give your foolery such license.â€

â€œfirst let your wisdom tell me,â€ said wamba, â€œis it just and reasonable
to punish one person for the fault of another?â€

â€œcertainly not, fool,â€ answered cedric.

â€œthen why should you shackle poor gurth, uncle, for the fault of his dog
fangs? for i dare be sworn we lost not a minute by the way, when we had
got our herd together, which fangs did not manage until we heard the
vesper-bell.â€

â€œthen hang up fangs,â€ said cedric, turning hastily towards the
swineherd, â€œif the fault is his, and get thee another dog.â€

 favour, uncle,â€ said the jester, â€œthat were still somewhat on the
bow-hand of fair justice; for it was no fault of fangs that he was lame
and could not gather the herd, but the fault of those that struck off
two of his fore-claws, an operation for which, if the poor fellow had
been consulted, he would scarce have given his voice.â€

â€œand who dared to lame an animal which belonged to my bondsman?â€ said
the saxon, kindling in wrath.

â€œmarry, that did old hubert,â€ said wamba, â€œsir philip de malvoisinâ€™s
keeper of the chase. he caught fangs strolling in the forest, and said
he chased the deer contrary to his masterâ€™s right, as warden of the
walk.â€

â€œthe foul fiend take malvoisin,â€ answered the saxon, â€œand his keeper
both! i will teach them that the wood was disforested in terms of
the great forest charter. but enough of this. go to, knave, go to thy

â€œi will spare your courtesy, sir knight,â€ said rowena with dignity, and
without unveiling herself; â€œor rather i will tax it so far as to require
of you the latest news from palestine, a theme more agreeable to our
english ears than the compliments which your french breeding teaches.â€

â€œi have little of importance to say, lady,â€ answered sir brian de
bois-guilbert, â€œexcepting the confirmed tidings of a truce with
saladin.â€

he was interrupted by wamba, who had taken his appropriated seat upon
a chair, the back of which was decorated with two assâ€™s ears, and which
was placed about two steps behind that of his master, who, from time
to time, supplied him with victuals from his own trencher; a favour,
however, which the jester shared with the favourite dogs, of whom, as we
have already noticed, there were several in attendance. here sat wamba,
with a small table before him, his heels tucked up against the bar of
the chair, his cheeks sucked u

suddenly he interrupted the stately templar, â€œmake an old man of me!â€

â€œgo to, knave, how so?â€ said cedric, his features prepared to receive
favourably the expected jest.

â€œbecause,â€ answered wamba, â€œi remember three of them in my day, each
of which was to endure for the course of fifty years; so that, by
computation, i must be at least a hundred and fifty years old.â€

â€œi will warrant you against dying of old age, however,â€ said the
templar, who now recognised his friend of the forest; â€œi will assure
you from all deaths but a violent one, if you give such directions to
wayfarers, as you did this night to the prior and me.â€

as the palmer, lighted by a domestic with a torch, passed through the
intricate combination of apartments of this large and irregular mansion,
the cupbearer coming behind him whispered in his ear, that if he had
no objection to a cup of good mead in his apartment, there were many
domestics in that family who would gladly hear the news he had brought
from the holy land, and particularly that which concerned the knight of
ivanhoe. wamba presently appeared to urge the same request, observing
that a cup after midnight was worth three after curfew. without
disputing a maxim urged by such grave authority, the palmer thanked them
for their courtesy, but observed that he had included in his religious
vow, an obligation never to speak in the kitchen on matters which were
prohibited in the hall. â€œthat vow,â€ said wamba to the cupbearer, â€œwould
scarce suit a serving-man.â€

the cupbearer shrugged up his shoulders in displeasure.

gurth, whose occupation, though now held so mean, gave him as much
consequence in saxon england as that of eumaeus in ithaca, was offended
at the familiar and commanding tone assumed by the palmer. â€œthe jew
leaving rotherwood,â€ said he, raising himself on his elbow, and looking
superciliously at him without quitting his pallet, â€œand travelling in
company with the palmer to boot--â€

â€œi should as soon have dreamt,â€ said wamba, who entered the apartment at
the instant, â€œof his stealing away with a gammon of bacon.â€

â€œnevertheless,â€ said gurth, again laying down his head on the wooden log
which served him for a pillow, â€œboth jew and gentile must be content to
abide the opening of the great gate--we suffer no visitors to depart by
stealth at these unseasonable hours.â€

â€œnevertheless,â€ said the pilgrim, in a commanding tone, â€œyou will not, i

so saying, he stooped over

with hasty alacrity gurth obeyed him, while wamba and the jew followed,
both wondering at the sudden change in the swineherdâ€™s demeanour. â€œmy

and to mortify ourselves with fastings, vigils, and long prayers.â€

â€œsomething more potent than that,â€ answered the jester; â€œfor when would
repentance or prayer make gurth do a courtesy, or fasting or vigil

observation the burden which he had thus deposited â€œen croupeâ€.

the pilgrim mounted with more deliberation, reaching, as he departed,
his hand to gurth, who kissed it with the utmost possible veneration.
the swineherd stood gazing after the travellers until they were lost
under the boughs of the forest path, when he was disturbed from his
reverie by the voice of wamba.

â€œknowest thou,â€ said the jester, â€œmy good friend gurth, that thou art
strangely courteous and most unwontedly pious on this summer morning? i
would i were a black prior or a barefoot palmer, to avail myself of thy
unwonted zeal and courtesy--certes, i would make more out of it than a
kiss of the hand.â€

â€œthou art no fool thus far, wamba,â€ answered gurth, â€œthough thou arguest
from appearances, and the wisest of us can do no more--but it is time to
look after my charge.â€

saxons.

â€œup, infidel dog when i command you,â€ said prince john, â€œor i will have
thy swarthy hide stript off, and tanned for horse-furniture.â€

thus urged, the jew began to ascend the steep and narrow steps which led
up to the gallery.

â€œlet me see,â€ said the prince, â€œwho dare stop him,â€ fixing his eye on
cedric, whose attitude intimated his intention to hurl the jew down
headlong.

the catastrophe was prevented by the clown wamba, who, springing
betwixt his master and isaac, and exclaiming, in answer to the princeâ€™s
defiance, â€œmarry, that will i!â€ opposed to the beard of the jew a shield
of brawn, which he plucked from beneath his cloak, and with which,
doubtless, he had furnished himself, lest the tournament should have
proved longer than his appetite could endure abstinence. finding the
abomination of his tribe opposed to his very nose, while the jester,
at the same time, flourished his wooden sword above his he

ad, the jew
recoiled, missed his footing, and rolled down the steps,--an excellent
jest to the spectators, who set up a loud laughter, in which prince john
and his attendants heartily joined.

â€œdeal me the prize, cousin prince,â€ said wamba; â€œi have vanquished my
foe in fair fight with sword and shield,â€ he added, brandishing the
brawn in one hand and the wooden sword in the other.

â€œwho, and what art thou, noble champion?â€ said prince john, still
laughing.

â€œa fool by right of descent,â€ answered the jester; â€œi am wamba, the
son of witless, who was the son of weatherbrain, who was the son of an
alderman.â€

â€œgramercy! good fellow,â€ cried prince john, â€œthou pleasest me--here,
isaac, lend me a handful of byzants.â€

as the jew, stunned by the request, afraid to refuse, and unwilling
to comply, fumbled in the furred bag which hung by his girdle, and
was perhaps endeavouring to ascertain how few coins might pass for a
handful, the prince stooped from his jennet and settled isaacâ€™s doubts
by snatching the pouch itself from his side; and flinging to wamba a
couple of the gold pieces which it contained, he pursued his career
round the lists, leaving the jew to the derision of those around him,
and himself receiving as much applause from the spectators as if he had
done some honest and honourable action.

two things displeased cedric in this speech. it contained the norman
word â€œmeleeâ€, (to express the general conflict,) and it evinced
some indifference to the honour of the country; but it was spoken by
athelstane, whom he held in such profound respect, that he would not
trust himself to canvass his motives or his foibles. moreover, he had
no time to make any remark, for wamba thrust in his word, observing, â€œit
was better, though scarce easier, to be the best man among a hundred,
than the best man of two.â€

athelstane took the observation as a serious compliment; but cedric,
who better understood the jesterâ€™s meaning, darted at him a severe and
menacing look; and lucky it was for wamba, perhaps, that the time and
place prevented his receiving, notwithstanding his place and service,
more sensible marks of his masterâ€™s resentment.

â€œand i,â€ said gurth, â€œfor a saxon swineherd, have not ill played the
personage of a norman squire-at-arms.â€

â€œyea, but,â€ answered the disinherited knight, â€œthou hast ever kept me in
anxiety lest thy clownish bearing should discover thee.â€

â€œtush!â€ said gurth, â€œi fear discovery from none, saving my playfellow,
wamba the jester, of whom i could never discover whether he were most
knave or fool. yet i could scarce choose but laugh, when my old master
passed so near to me, dreaming all the while that gurth was keeping his
porkers many a mile off, in the thickets and swamps of rotherwood. if i

in the present instance, the apprehension of impending evil was inspired
by no less respectable a prophet than a large lean black dog, which,
sitting upright, howled most piteously as the foremost riders left the
gate, and presently afterwards, barking wildly, and jumping to and fro,
seemed bent upon attaching itself to the party.

â€œi like not that music, father cedric,â€ said athelstane; for by this
title of respect he was accustomed to address him.

â€œnor i either, uncle,â€ said wamba; â€œi greatly fear we shall have to pay
the piper.â€

â€œin my mind,â€ said athelstane, upon whose memory the abbotâ€™s good
ale (for burton was already famous for that genial liquor) had made a
favourable impression,--â€œin my mind we had better turn back, and abide
with the abbot until the afternoon. it is unlucky to travel where your
path is crossed by a monk, a hare, or a howling dog, until you have
eaten your next meal.â€

rejoicing at his reappearance. the javelin inflicted a wound upon the
animalâ€™s shoulder, and narrowly missed pinning him to the earth; and
fangs fled howling from the presence of the enraged thane. gurthâ€™s heart
swelled within him; for he felt this meditated slaughter of his faithful
adherent in a degree much deeper than the harsh treatment he had himself
received. having in vain attempted to raise his hand to his eyes,
he said to wamba, who, seeing his masterâ€™s ill humour had prudently
retreated to the rear, â€œi pray thee, do me the kindness to wipe my eyes
with the skirt of thy mantle; the dust offends me, and these bonds will
not let me help myself one way or another.â€

wamba did him the service he required, and they rode side by side for
some time, during which gurth maintained a moody silence. at length he
could repress his feelings no longer.

scourge me--he may load me with irons--but henceforth he shall never
compel me either to love or to obey him. go to him, then, and tell him
that gurth the son of beowulph renounces his service.â€

â€œassuredly,â€ said wamba, â€œfool as i am, i shall not do your foolâ€™s
errand. cedric hath another javelin stuck into his girdle, and thou
knowest he does not always miss his mark.â€

â€œi care not,â€ replied gurth, â€œhow soon he makes a mark of me. yesterday

the travellers had now reached the verge of the wooded country, and were
about to plunge into its recesses, held dangerous at that time from the
number of outlaws whom oppression and poverty had driven to despair,
and who occupied the forests in such large bands as could easily bid
defiance to the feeble police of the period. from these rovers, however,
notwithstanding the lateness of the hour cedric and athelstane accounted
themselves secure, as they had in attendance ten servants, besides wamba
and gurth, whose aid could not be counted upon, the one being a jester
and the other a captive. it may be added, that in travelling thus late
through the forest, cedric and athelstane relied on their descent and
character, as well as their courage. the outlaws, whom the severity of
the forest laws had reduced to this roving and desperate mode of life,
were chiefly peasants and yeomen of saxon descent, and were generally
supposed to respect the persons and property of their countrymen.

they be, we cannot as christians leave them in this extremity. let them
unload two of the sumpter-mules, and put the baggage behind two of the
serfs. the mules may transport the litter, and we have led horses for
the old man and his daughter.â€

cedric readily assented to what she proposed, and athelstane only added
the condition, â€œthat they should travel in the rear of the whole party,
where wamba,â€ he said, â€œmight attend them with his shield of boarâ€™s
brawn.â€

â€œi have left my shield in the tilt-yard,â€ answered the jester, â€œas has
been the fate of many a better knight than myself.â€

athelstane coloured deeply, for such had been his own fate on the
last day of the tournament; while rowena, who was pleased in the same
proportion, as if to make amends for the brutal jest of her unfeeling
suitor, requested rebecca to ride by her side.

â€œit were not fit i should do so,â€ an

â€œwhere my society might be held a disgrace to my protectress.â€

by this time the change of baggage was hastily achieved; for the single
word â€œoutlawsâ€ rendered every one sufficiently alert, and the approach
of twilight made the sound yet more impressive. amid the bustle, gurth
was taken from horseback, in the course of which removal he prevailed
upon the jester to slack the cord with which his arms were bound. it was
so negligently refastened, perhaps intentionally, on the part of wamba,
that gurth found no difficulty in freeing his arms altogether from
bondage, and then, gliding into the thicket, he made his escape from the
party.

the bustle had been considerable, and it was some time before gurth was
missed; for, as he was to be placed for the rest of the journey behind
a servant, every one supposed that some other of his companions had him
under his custody, and when it began to be whispered among them
that gurth had actually disappeared, they were under such immediate

ded around him. athelstane shared his captivity, his bridle having
been seized, and he himself forcibly dismounted, long before he could
draw his weapon, or assume any posture of effectual defence.

the attendants, embarrassed with baggage, surprised and terrified at the
fate of their masters, fell an easy prey to the assailants; while
the lady rowena, in the centre of the cavalcade, and the jew and his
daughter in the rear, experienced the same misfortune.

of all the train none escaped except wamba, who showed upon the
occasion much more courage than those who pretended to greater sense. he
possessed himself of a sword belonging to one of the domestics, who was
just drawing it with a tardy and irresolute hand, laid it about him like
a lion, drove back several who approached him, and made a brave though
ineffectual attempt to succour his master. finding himself overpowered,
the jester at length threw himself from his horse, plunged into the
thicket, and, favoured by the general confusion, 
 
 ___________________________
 
escaped from the scene
of action. yet the valiant jester, as soon as he found himself safe,
hesitated more than once whether he should not turn back and share the
captivity of a master to whom he was sincerely attached.

â€œi have heard men talk of the blessings of freedom,â€ he said to himself,
â€œbut i wish any wise man would teach me what use to make of it now that
i have it.â€

as he pronounced these words aloud, a voice very near him called out in
a low and cautious tone, â€œwamba!â€ and, at the same time, a dog, which he
recognised to be fangs, jumped up and fawned upon him. â€œgurth!â€ answered
wamba, with the same caution, and the swineherd immediately stood before
him.

â€œwhat is the matter?â€ said he eagerly; â€œwhat mean these cries, and that
clashing of swords?â€

â€œonly a trick of the times,â€ said wamba; â€œthey are all prisoners.â€

â€œwho are prisoners?â€ exclaimed gurth, impatiently.

â€œmy lord, and my lady, and athelstane, and hundibert, and oswald
 
 ___________________________
 
 â€œhow came they prisoners?--and to
whom?â€

â€œour master was too ready to fight,â€ said the jester; â€œand athelstane
was not ready enough, and no other person was ready at all. and they are
prisoners to green cassocks, and black visors. and they lie all tumbled
about on the green, like the crab-apples that you shake down to your
swine. and i would laugh at it,â€ said the honest jester, â€œif i could for
weeping.â€ and he shed tears of unfeigned sorrow.

gurthâ€™s countenance kindled--â€œwamba,â€ he said, â€œthou hast a weapon,
and thy heart was ever stronger than thy brain,--we are only two--but a
sudden attack from men of resolution will do much--follow me!â€

â€œwhither?--and for what purpose?â€ said the jester.

â€œto rescue cedric.â€

â€œbut you have renounced his service but now,â€ said wamba.

â€œthat,â€ said gurth, â€œwas but while he was fortunate--follow me!â€

as the jester was about to obey, a third person suddenly made his
appearance, and commanded them both to ha

wamba would have conjectured him to be one of those outlaws who had just
assailed his master; but, besides that he wore no mask, the glittering
baldric across his shoulder, with the rich bugle-horn which it
supported, as well as the calm and commanding expression of his voice
and manner, made him, notwithstanding the twilight, recognise locksley
the yeoman, who had been victorious, under such disadvantageous
circumstances, in the contest for the prize of archery.

â€œyou may look at their cassocks close by,â€ said wamba, â€œand see whether

one green pea-cod is to another.â€

â€œi will learn that presently,â€ answered locksley; â€œand i charge ye, on
peril of your lives, not to stir from the place where ye stand, until
i have returned. obey me, and it shall be the better for you and your
masters.--yet stay, i must render myself as like these men as possible.â€

and, repeating his charges to them to stand fast, went to execute his
purposes of reconnoitring.

â€œshall we stand fast, gurth?â€ said wamba; â€œor shall we eâ€™en give him
leg-bail? in my foolish mind, he had all the equipage of a thief too
much in readiness, to be himself a true man.â€

â€œlet him be the devil,â€ said gurth, â€œan he will. we can be no worse of
waiting his return. if he belong to that party, he must already have
given them the alarm, and it will avail nothing either to fight or fly.
besides, i have late experience, that errant thieves are not the worst
men in the world to have to deal with.â€

until i gather more aid.â€

so saying, he walked through the wood at a great pace, followed by the
jester and the swineherd. it was not consistent with wambaâ€™s humour to
travel long in silence.

â€œi think,â€ said he, looking at the baldric and bugle which he still
carried, â€œthat i saw the arrow shot which won this gay prize, and that
not so long since as christmas.â€

â€œand i,â€ said gurth, â€œcould take it on my halidome, that i have heard
the voice of the good yeoman who won it, by night as well as by day, and
that the moon is not three days older since i did so.â€

â€œour heads are in the lionâ€™s mouth,â€ said wamba, in a whisper to gurth,
â€œget them out how we can.â€

â€œhush--be silent,â€ said gurth. â€œoffend him not by thy folly, and i trust

they promised implicit obedience, and departed with alacrity on
their different errands. in the meanwhile, their leader and his two
companions, who now looked upon him with great respect, as well as some
fear, pursued their way to the chapel of copmanhurst.

when they had reached the little moonlight glade, having in front the
reverend, though ruinous chapel, and the rude hermitage, so well
suited to ascetic devotion, wamba whispered to gurth, â€œif this be the
habitation of a thief, it makes good the old proverb, the nearer the
church the farther from god.--and by my coxcomb,â€ he added, â€œi think it
be even so--hearken but to the black sanctus which they are singing in
the hermitage!â€

in fact the anchorite and his guest were performing, at the full extent
of their very powerful lungs, an old drinking song, of which this was
the burden:--

     â€œcome, trowl the brown bowl to me,

â€œnow, that is not ill sung,â€ said wamba, who had thrown in a few of his
own flourishes to help out the chorus. â€œbut who, in the saintâ€™s name,
ever expected to have heard such a jolly chant come from out a hermitâ€™s
cell at midnight!â€

â€œmarry, that should i,â€ said gurth, â€œfor the jolly clerk of copmanhurst

will be stripped of his cowl and cope altogether, if he keeps not better

â€œthou compel!â€ said the friar; â€œwait but till have changed this grey
gown for a green cassock, and if i make not a quarter-staff ring twelve

while he spoke thus, he stript off his gown, and appeared in a close
black buckram doublet and drawers, over which he speedily did on a
cassock of green, and hose of the same colour. â€œi pray thee truss my
points,â€ said he to wamba, â€œand thou shalt have a cup of sack for thy
labour.â€

â€œgramercy for thy sack,â€ said wamba; â€œbut thinkâ€™st thou it is lawful
for me to aid you to transmew thyself from a holy hermit into a sinful
forester?â€

â€œnever fear,â€ said the hermit; â€œi will but confess the sins of my green
cloak to my greyfriarâ€™s frock, and all shall be well again.â€

resolution. i will, therefore, ask thee no further questions, but aid
thee in setting at freedom these oppressed captives; which done, i trust
we shall part better acquainted, and well satisfied with each other.â€

â€œso,â€ said wamba to gurth,--for the friar being now fully equipped, the
jester, having approached to the other side of the hut, had heard the
conclusion of the conversation,--â€œso we have got a new ally?--l trust
the valour of the knight will be truer metal than the religion of the
hermit, or the honesty of the yeoman; for this locksley looks like a
born deer-stealer, and the priest like a lusty hypocrite.â€

extraordinary cartel that ever was sent across the drawbridge of a
baronial castle.â€

â€œjest!â€ said front-de-boeuf, â€œi would gladly know who dares jest with me
in such a matter!--read it, sir brian.â€

the templar accordingly read it as follows:--â€œi, wamba, the son of

called the saxon,--and i, gurth, the son of beowulph, the swineherd---â€

â€œthou art mad,â€ said front-de-boeuf, interrupting the reader.

â€œby st luke, it is so set down,â€ answered the templar. then resuming his
task, he went on,--â€œi, gurth, the son of beowulph, swineherd unto the

at the bottom of this document was scrawled, in the first place, a
rude sketch of a cockâ€™s head and comb, with a legend expressing this
hieroglyphic to be the sign-manual of wamba, son of witless. under this
respectable emblem stood a cross, stated to be the mark of gurth, the
son of beowulph. then was written, in rough bold characters, the words,
â€œle noir faineantâ€. and, to conclude the whole, an arrow, neatly enough
drawn, was described as the mark of the yeoman locksley.

the knights heard this uncommon document read from end to end, and then
gazed upon each other in silent amazement, as being utterly at a loss to
know what it could portend. de bracy was the first

this letter being folded, was delivered to the squire, and by him to
the messenger who waited without, as the answer to that which he had
brought.

the yeoman having thus accomplished his mission, returned to the
head-quarters of the allies, which were for the present established
under a venerable oak-tree, about three arrow-flights distant from the
castle. here wamba and gurth, with their allies the black knight and
locksley, and the jovial hermit, awaited with impatience an answer to
their summons. around, and at a distance from them, were seen many a
bold yeoman, whose silvan dress and weatherbeaten countenances showed
the ordinary nature of their occupation. more than two hundred had
already assembled, and others were fast coming in. those whom they
obeyed as leaders were only distinguished from the others by a feather

he then gave the letter to gurth, who shook his head gruffly, and passed
it to wamba. the jester looked at each of the four corners of the paper
with such a grin of affected intelligence as a monkey is apt to assume
upon similar occasions, then cut a caper, and gave the letter to
locksley.

castle, should we tear it down with our hands!â€

â€œwe have nothing else to tear it with,â€ replied wamba; â€œbut mine are
scarce fit to make mammocks of freestone and mortar.â€

â€œâ€˜tis but a contrivance to gain time,â€ said locksley; â€œthey dare

ce!â€ said the pious hermit; â€œi tell thee,
sir slothful knight, that when i doff my friarâ€™s frock, my priesthood,
my sanctity, my very latin, are put off along with it; and when in my
green jerkin, i can better kill twenty deer than confess one christian.â€

â€œi fear,â€ said the black knight, â€œi fear greatly, there is no one here
that is qualified to take upon him, for the nonce, this same character
of father confessor?â€

all looked on each other, and were silent.

â€œi see,â€ said wamba, after a short pause, â€œthat the fool must be still
the fool, and put his neck in the venture which wise men shrink from.
you must know, my dear cousins and countrymen, that i wore russet before
i wore motley, and was bred to be a friar, until a brain-fever came
upon me and left me just wit enough to be a fool. i trust, with the
assistance of the good hermitâ€™s frock, together with the priesthood,
sanctity, and learning which are stitched into the cowl of it, i shall
be found qualified to adm

â€œon with the frock, then, good fellow,â€ quoth the knight, â€œand let thy
master send us an account of their situation within the castle. their
numbers must be few, and it is five to one they may be accessible by a
sudden and bold attack. time wears--away with thee.â€

â€œand, in the meantime,â€ said locksley, â€œwe will beset the place so
closely, that not so much as a fly shall carry news from thence. so
that, my good friend,â€ he continued, addressing wamba, â€œthou mayst
assure these tyrants, that whatever violence they exercise on the
persons of their prisoners, shall be most severely repaid upon their
own.â€

â€œpax vobiscum,â€ said wamba, who was now muffled in his religious
disguise.

and so saying he imitated the solemn and stately deportment of a friar,
and departed to execute his mission.

with this threat he left his turret, and carried to the hall of the
castle his unwonted intelligence, that a holy friar stood before the
gate and demanded instant admission. with no small wonder he received
his masterâ€™s commands to admit the holy man immediately; and, having
previously manned the entrance to guard against surprise, he obeyed,
without further scruple, the commands which he had received. the
harebrained self-conceit which had emboldened wamba to undertake this
dangerous office, was scarce sufficient to support him when he found
himself in the presence of a man so dreadful, and so much dreaded, as
reginald front-de-boeuf, and he brought out his â€œpax vobiscumâ€, to which
he, in a good measure, trusted for supporting his character, with
more anxiety and hesitation than had hitherto accompanied it. but
front-de-boeuf was accustomed to see men of all ranks tremble in his
presence, so that the timidity of the supposed father did not gi

â€œthen trust him not with thy purpose in words,â€ answered the templar.
â€œlet him carry a written order to de bracyâ€™s company of free companions,
to repair instantly to their masterâ€™s aid. in the meantime, and that the
shaveling may suspect nothing, permit him to go freely about his task of
preparing these saxon hogs for the slaughter-house.â€

â€œit shall be so,â€ said front-de-boeuf. and he forthwith appointed a
domestic to conduct wamba to the apartment where cedric and athelstane
were confined.

the impatience of cedric had been rather enhanced than diminished by his
confinement. he walked from one end of the hall to the other, with the
attitude of one who advances to charge an enemy, or to storm the breach
of a beleaguered place, sometimes ejaculating to himself, sometimes
addressing athelstane, who stoutly and stoically awaited the issue of
the adventure, digesting, in the meantime, with great composure, the
liberal meal wh

than live like slaves.â€

â€œi am ready,â€ answered athelstane, â€œto stand the worst of their malice,
and shall walk to my death with as much composure as ever i did to my
dinner.â€

â€œlet us then unto our holy gear, father,â€ said cedric.

â€œwait yet a moment, good uncle,â€ said the jester, in his natural tone;
â€œbetter look long before you leap in the dark.â€

â€œby my faith,â€ said cedric, â€œi should know that voice!â€

â€œit is that of your trusty slave and jester,â€ answered wamba, throwing
back his cowl. â€œhad you taken a foolâ€™s advice formerly, you would not
have been here at all. take a foolâ€™s advice now, and you will not be
here long.â€

â€œhow meanâ€™st thou, knave?â€ answered the saxon.

â€œeven thus,â€ replied wamba; â€œtake thou this frock and cord, which are
all the orders i ever had, and march quietly out of the castle, leaving
me your cloak and girdle to take the long leap in thy stead.â€

â€œleave thee in my stead!â€ said cedric, astonished at the p

roposal; â€œwhy,
they would hang thee, my poor knave.â€

â€œeâ€™en let them do as they are permitted,â€ said wamba; â€œi trust--no
disparagement to your birth--that the son of witless may hang in a chain
with as much gravity as the chain hung upon his ancestor the alderman.â€

â€œwell, wamba,â€ answered cedric, â€œfor one thing will i grant thy request.
and that is, if thou wilt make the exchange of garments with lord
athelstane instead of me.â€

â€œno, by st dunstan,â€ answered wamba; â€œthere were little reason in that.
good right there is, that the son of witless should suffer to save
the son of hereward; but little wisdom there were in his dying for the
benefit of one whose fathers were strangers to his.â€

â€œvillain,â€ said cedric, â€œthe fathers of athelstane were monarchs of
england!â€

â€œthey might be whomsoever they pleased,â€ replied wamba; â€œbut my neck
stands too straight upon my shoulders to have it twisted for their sake.
wherefore, good my master, eithe

the duty of each who has saxon blood in his veins. thou and i will abide
together the utmost rage of our injurious oppressors, while he, free and
safe, shall arouse the awakened spirits of our countrymen to avenge us.â€

â€œnot so, father cedric,â€ said athelstane, grasping his hand,--for, when
roused to think or act, his deeds and sentiments were not unbecoming his
high race--â€œnot so,â€ he continued; â€œi would rather remain in this hall

chucked from hand to hand like a shuttlecock or stool-ball. iâ€™ll hang

â€œgo, then, noble cedric,â€ said athelstane, â€œneglect not this
opportunity. your presence without may encourage friends to our
rescue--your remaining here would ruin us all.â€

â€œand is there any prospect, then, of rescue from without?â€ said cedric,
looking to the jester.

â€œprospect, indeed!â€ echoed wamba; â€œlet me tell you, when you fill my
cloak, you are wrapped in a generalâ€™s cassock. five hundred men are
there without, and i was this morning one of the chief leaders. my
foolâ€™s cap was a casque, and my bauble a truncheon. well, we shall see
what good they will make by exchanging a fool for a wise man. truly, i
fear they will lose in valour what they may gain in discretion. and so

rwood, in memory that i flung away
my life for my master, like a faithful---fool.â€

the last word came out with a sort of double expression, betwixt jest
and earnest. the tears stood in cedricâ€™s eyes.

â€œthy memory shall be preserved,â€ he said, â€œwhile fidelity and affection
have honour upon earth! but that i trust i shall find the means of
saving rowena, and thee, athelstane, and thee, also, my poor wamba, thou
shouldst not overbear me in this matter.â€

the exchange of dress was now accomplished, when a sudden doubt struck
cedric.

â€œi know no language,â€ he said, â€œbut my own, and a few words of their
mincing norman. how shall i bear myself like a reverend brother?â€

â€œthe spell lies in two words,â€ replied wamba--â€œâ€˜pax vobiscumâ€™ will
answer all queries. if you go or come, eat or drink, bless or ban, â€˜pax
vobiscumâ€™ carries you through it all. it is as useful to a friar as a

who risked himself for his master, if cedricâ€™s peril can prevent
it.--farewell.â€

â€œfarewell, noble cedric,â€ said athelstane; â€œremember it is the true part
of a friar to accept refreshment, if you are offered any.â€

â€œfarewell, uncle,â€ added wamba; â€œand remember â€˜pax vobiscumâ€™.â€

thus exhorted, cedric sallied forth upon his expedition; and it was not
long ere he had occasion to try the force of that spell which his jester
had recommended as omnipotent. in a low-arched and dusky passage, by
which he endeavoured to work his way to the hall of the castle, he was
interrupted by a female form.

â€œâ€˜pax vobiscum!â€™â€ said the pseudo friar, and was endeavouring to
hurry past, when a soft voice replied, â€œâ€˜et vobis--quaso, domine

walls, if i have art and influence to detain them there.â€

â€œha!â€ said front-de-boeuf, â€œthou changest thy tone, sir priest, and
speakest brief and bold, as if thy heart were in the slaughter of the
saxon herd; and yet thou art thyself of kindred to the swine?â€

cedric was no ready practiser of the art of dissimulation, and would
at this moment have been much the better of a hint from wambaâ€™s more
fertile brain. but necessity, according to the ancient proverb, sharpens
invention, and he muttered something under his cowl concerning the men
in question being excommunicated outlaws both to church and to kingdom.

â€œâ€˜despardieuxâ€™,â€ answered front-de-boeuf, â€œthou hast spoken the very
truth--i forgot that the knaves can strip a fat abbot, as well as if
they had been born south of yonder salt channel. was it not he of st

his commands were obeyed; and, upon entering that gothic apartment, hung
with many spoils won by his own valour and that of his father, he found
a flagon of wine on the massive oaken table, and the two saxon captives
under the guard of four of his dependants. front-de-boeuf took a long
drought of wine, and then addressed his prisoners;--for the manner in
which wamba drew the cap over his face, the change of dress, the gloomy
and broken light, and the baronâ€™s imperfect acquaintance with the
features of cedric, (who avoided his norman neighbours, and seldom
stirred beyond his own domains,) prevented him from discovering that the
most important of his captives had made his escape.

â€œgallants of england,â€ said front-de-boeuf, â€œhow relish ye your

â€œnot a doit i,â€ answered poor wamba--â€œand for hanging up by the feet,

first round my head; so turning me upside down may peradventure restore
it again.â€

â€œsaint genevieve!â€ said front-de-boeuf, â€œwhat have we got here?â€

and with the back of his hand he struck cedricâ€™s cap from the head of
the jester, and throwing open his collar, discovered the fatal badge of
servitude, the silver collar round his neck.

nostrils.--go,â€ said he to two of his attendants, â€œfetch me the right

mistook a fool for a saxon franklin.â€

â€œay, but,â€ said wamba, â€œyour chivalrous excellency will find there are
more fools than franklins among us.â€

â€œwhat means the knave?â€ said front-de-boeuf, looking towards his
followers, who, lingering and loath, faltered forth their belief, that
if this were not cedric who was there in presence, they knew not what
was become of him.

â€œsaints of heaven!â€ exclaimed de bracy, â€œhe must have escaped in the

â€œyou deal with me better than your word, noble knight,â€ whimpered forth
poor wamba, whose habits of buffoonery were not to be overcome even
by the immediate prospect of death; â€œif you give me the red cap you
propose, out of a simple monk you will make a cardinal.â€

turns jest into earnest.â€

â€œthe lady rowena,â€ answered athelstane, with the most steady
countenance, â€œis my affianced bride. i will be drawn by wild horses
before i consent to part with her. the slave wamba has this day saved
the life of my father cedric--i will lose mine ere a hair of his head be

â€œthy affianced bride?--the lady rowena the affianced bride of a vassal
like thee?â€ said de bracy; â€œsaxon, thou dreamest that the days of thy
seven kingdoms are returned again. i tell thee, the princes of the house

or to affirm he was unlawfully made my prisoner, by the belt of saint

the saxon prisoners were accordingly removed, just as they introduced
the monk ambrose, who appeared to be in great perturbation.

â€œthis is the real â€˜deus vobiscumâ€™,â€ said wamba, as he passed the
reverend brother; â€œthe others were but counterfeits.â€

moreover, that he and his comrades, and especially wamba the jester,

death. he committed her to the charge of gurth, to be conducted in
safety to the barbican, the road to which was now cleared of the enemy,
and not yet interrupted by the flames. this accomplished, the loyal
cedric hastened in quest of his friend athelstane, determined, at every
risk to himself, to save that last scion of saxon royalty. but ere
cedric penetrated as far as the old hall in which he had himself been
a prisoner, the inventive genius of wamba had procured liberation for
himself and his companion in adversity.

when the noise of the conflict announced that it was at the hottest, the
jester began to shout, with the utmost power of his lungs, â€œsaint george
and the dragon!--bonny saint george for merry england!--the castle is
won!â€ and these sounds he rendered yet more fearful, by banging against
each other two or three pieces of rusty armour which lay scattered
around the hall.

into the court of the castle, which was now the last scene of contest.

athelstane, who, as the reader knows, was slothful, but not cowardly,
beheld the female form whom the templar protected thus sedulously, and
doubted not that it was rowena whom the knight was carrying off, in
despite of all resistance which could be offered.

â€œby the soul of saint edward,â€ he said, â€œi will rescue her from yonder
over-proud knight, and he shall die by my hand!â€

â€œthink what you do!â€ cried wamba; â€œhasty hand catches frog for fish--by

half-wheeling his steed, he made a demi-courbette towards the saxon, and
rising in the stirrups, so as to take full advantage of the descent of
the horse, he discharged a fearful blow upon the head of athelstane.

well said wamba, that silken bonnet keeps out no steel blade. so
trenchant was the templarâ€™s weapon, that it shore asunder, as it had
been a willow twig, the tough and plaited handle of the mace, which the
ill-fated saxon reared to parry the blow, and, descending on his head,
levelled him with the earth.

â€œâ€˜ha! beau-seant!â€™â€ exclaimed bois-guilbert, â€œthus be it to the
maligners of the temple-knights!â€ taking advantage of the dismay which
was spread by the fall of athelstane, and calling aloud, â€

consumed, a great deal of plate, rich armour, and splendid clothing,
had been secured by the exertions of the dauntless outlaws, who could be
appalled by no danger when such rewards were in view. yet so strict were
the laws of their society, that no one ventured to appropriate any
part of the booty, which was brought into one common mass, to be at the
disposal of their leader.

the place of rendezvous was an aged oak; not however the same to which
locksley had conducted gurth and wamba in the earlier part of the story,
but one which was the centre of a silvan amphitheatre, within half a
mile of the demolished castle of torquilstone. here locksley assumed his
seat--a throne of turf erected under the twisted branches of the huge
oak, and the silvan followers were gathered around him. he assigned to
the black knight a seat at his right hand, and to cedric a place upon
his left.

most--take of the spoil what may reward your own neighbours and
followers.â€

â€œi am rich enough to reward them from mine own wealth,â€ answered cedric.

â€œand some,â€ said wamba, â€œhave been wise enough to reward themselves;
they do not march off empty-handed altogether. we do not all wear
motley.â€

â€œthey are welcome,â€ said locksley; â€œour laws bind none but ourselves.â€

â€œbut, thou, my poor knave,â€ said cedric, turning about and embracing
his jester, â€œhow shall i reward thee, who feared not to give thy body

that faithful cur, seeing his master thus transported, began to jump
upon him, to express his sympathy,--â€œknowest thou thy master still?â€

â€œi forgive you, sir knight,â€ said rowena, â€œas a christian.â€

â€œthat means,â€ said wamba, â€œthat she does not forgive him at all.â€

â€œi have but to say,â€ added the saxon, â€œthat, during the funeral rites
of the noble athelstane, i shall be an inhabitant of the halls of his
castle of coningsburgh--they will be open to all who choose to partake
of the funeral banqueting; and, i speak in name of the noble edith,
mother of the fallen prince, they will never be shut against him who
laboured so bravely, though unsuccessfully, to save athelstane from
norman chains and norman steel.â€

â€œay, ay,â€ said wamba, who had resumed his attendance on his master,
â€œrare feeding there will be--pity that the noble athelstane cannot
banquet at his own funeral.--but he,â€ continued the jester, lifting up
his eyes gravely, â€œis supping in paradise, and doubtless does honour to
the cheer.â€

â€œpeace, and move on,â€ said cedric, his anger at this untimely jest being
checked by the recollection of wambaâ€™s recent services. rowena waved a
graceful adieu to him of the fetterlock--the saxon bade god speed him,

     shadows avaunt!--richardâ€™s himself again.
     richard iii

when the black knight--for it becomes necessary to resume the train of
his adventures--left the trysting-tree of the generous outlaw, he held
his way straight to a neighbouring religious house, of small extent
and revenue, called the priory of saint botolph, to which the wounded
ivanhoe had been removed when the castle was taken, under the guidance
of the faithful gurth, and the magnanimous wamba. it is unnecessary at
present to mention what took place in the interim betwixt wilfred
and his deliverer; suffice it to say, that after long and grave
communication, messengers were dispatched by the prior in several
directions, and that on the succeeding morning the black knight was
about to set forth on his journey, accompanied by the jester wamba, who
attended as his guide.

â€œwe will meet,â€ he said to ivanhoe, â€œat coningsburgh, the castle of the
deceased athelstane, since there thy fa

e relation. i would see your saxon kindred together,
sir wilfred, and become better acquainted with them than heretofore.
thou also wilt meet me; and it shall be my task to reconcile thee to thy
father.â€

so saying, he took an affectionate farewell of ivanhoe, who expressed an
anxious desire to attend upon his deliverer. but the black knight would
not listen to the proposal.

â€œrest this day; thou wilt have scarce strength enough to travel on the
next. i will have no guide with me but honest wamba, who can play priest
or fool as i shall be most in the humour.â€

â€œand i,â€ said wamba, â€œwill attend you with all my heart. i would fain
see the feasting at the funeral of athelstane; for, if it be not full
and frequent, he will rise from the dead to rebuke cook, sewer, and
cupbearer; and that were a sight worth seeing. always, sir knight, i
will trust your valour with making my excuse to my master cedric, in
case mine own wit should fail.â€

â€œand how should my poor valour succeed, sir

ods as well as eâ€™er a hunter who frequents them; and the poor
knave, as thou hast partly seen, is as faithful as steel.â€

â€œnay,â€ said the knight, â€œan he have the gift of showing my road, i shall
not grumble with him that he desires to make it pleasant.--fare
thee well, kind wilfred--i charge thee not to attempt to travel till
to-morrow at earliest.â€

so saying, he extended his hand to ivanhoe, who pressed it to his lips,
took leave of the prior, mounted his horse, and departed, with wamba for
his companion. ivanhoe followed them with his eyes, until they were
lost in the shades of the surrounding forest, and then returned into the
convent.

but shortly after matin-song, he requested to see the prior. the old man
came in haste, and enquired anxiously after the state of his health.

â€œit is better,â€ he said, â€œthan my fondest hope could have anticipated;
either my wound has been slighter than the effusion of blood led me to
suppose, or this balsam hath wrought a wonderful cure

was a familiar thought, as with one whose trade was war and adventure.

the jester wore his usual fantastic habit, but late accidents had led
him to adopt a good cutting falchion, instead of his wooden sword, with
a targe to match it; of both which weapons he had, notwithstanding
his profession, shown himself a skilful master during the storming of
torquilstone. indeed, the infirmity of wambaâ€™s brain consisted chiefly
in a kind of impatient irritability, which suffered him not long to
remain quiet in any posture, or adhere to any certain train of ideas,
although he was for a few minutes alert enough in performing any
immediate task, or in apprehending any immediate topic. on horseback,
therefore, he was perpetually swinging himself backwards and forwards,
now on the horseâ€™s ears, then anon on the very rump of the animal,--now
hanging both his legs on one side, and now sitting wi

and thus run the ditty:--

     mists are dispersing, love, birds singing free,
     up in the morning, love, anna-marie.
     anna-marie, love, up in the morn,
     the hunter is winding blithe sounds on his horn,
     the echo rings merry from rock and from tree,

wamba.

     o tybalt, love, tybalt, awake me not yet,
     around my soft pillow while softer dreams flit,
     for what are the joys that in waking we prove,
     compared with these visions, o, tybalt, my love?
     let the birds to the rise of the mist carol shrill,
     let the hunter blow out his loud horn on the hill,
     softer sounds, softer pleasures, in slumber i prove,--

melody, that we lay in bed two hours after sunrise, singing the ditty

since. nevertheless, i have played the part of anna-marie, to please
you, fair sir.â€

the jester next struck into another carol, a sort of comic ditty, to
which the knight, catching up the tune, replied in the like manner.

     there came three merry men from south, west, and north,
     ever more sing the roundelay;
     to win the widow of wycombe forth,
     and where was the widow might say them nay?

     the first was a knight, and from tynedale he came,
     ever more sing the roundelay;
     and his fathers, god save us, were men of great fame,
     and where was the widow might say him nay?

     of his father the laird, of his uncle the squire,
     he boasted in rhyme and in roundelay;

wamba.

     the next that came forth, swore by blood and by nails,
     merrily sing the roundelay;
     hurâ€™s a gentleman, god wot, and hurâ€™s lineage was of wales,
     and where was the widow might say him nay?

     sir david ap morgan ap griffith ap hugh

     she said that one widow for so many was too few,
     and she bade the welshman wend his way.

     but then next came a yeoman, a yeoman of kent,

both.

     so the knight and the squire were both left in the mire,
     there for to sing their roundelay;
     for a yeoman of kent, with his yearly rent,
     there never was a widow could say him nay.

â€œi would, wamba,â€ said the knight, â€œthat our host of the trysting-tree,
or the jolly friar, his chaplain, heard this thy ditty in praise of our
bluff yeoman.â€

â€œso would not i,â€ said wamba--â€œbut for the horn that hangs at your
baldric.â€

â€œay,â€ said the knight,--â€œthis is a pledge of locksleyâ€™s goodwill, though
i am not like to need it. three mots on this bugle will, i am assured,
bring round, at our need, a jolly band of yonder honest yeomen.â€

â€œi would say, heaven forefend,â€ said the jester, â€œwere it not that that
fair gift is a pledge they would let us pass peaceably.â€

â€œwhy, what meanest thou?â€ said the knight; â€œthinkest thou that but for

â€œnay, for me i say nothing,â€ said wamba; â€œfor green trees have ears as
well as stone walls. but canst thou construe me this, sir knight--when
is thy wine-pitcher and thy purse better empty than full?â€

â€œwhy, never, i think,â€ replied the knight.

â€œthou never deservest to have a full one in thy hand, for so simple an
answer! thou hadst best empty thy pitcher ere thou pass it to a saxon,
and leave thy money at home ere thou walk in the greenwood.â€

â€œyou hold our friends for robbers, then?â€ said the knight of the

â€œyou hear me not say so, fair sir,â€ said wamba; â€œit may relieve a manâ€™s

certes, it may do good to the riderâ€™s soul to ease him of that which is
the root of evil; therefore will i give no hard names to those who do
such services. only i would wish my mail at home, and my purse in my
chamber, when i meet with these good fellows, because it might save them
some trouble.â€

â€œwe are bound to pray for them, my friend, notwithstanding the fair

â€œpray for them with all my heart,â€ said wamba; â€œbut in the town, not
in the greenwood, like the abbot of saint bees, whom they caused to say
mass with an old hollow oak-tree for his stall.â€

â€œsay as thou list, wamba,â€ replied the knight, â€œthese yeomen did thy
master cedric yeomanly service at torquilstone.â€

â€œay, truly,â€ answered wamba; â€œbut that was in the fashion of their trade
with heaven.â€

â€œtheir trade, wamba! how mean you by that?â€ replied his companion.

â€œmarry, thus,â€ said the jester. â€œthey make up a balanced account with
heaven, as our old cellarer used to call his ciphering, as fair as isaac
the jew keeps with his debtors, and, like him, give out a very little,
and take large credit for doing so; reckoning, doubtless, on their own
behalf the seven-fold usury which the blessed text hath promised to
charitable loans.â€

â€œgive me an example of your meaning, wamba,--i know nothing of cip

or rates of usage,â€ answered the knight.

â€œwhy,â€ said wamba, â€œan your valour be so dull, you will please to learn
that those honest fellows balance a good deed with one not quite so
laudable; as a crown given to a begging friar with an hundred byzants
taken from a fat abbot, or a wench kissed in the greenwood with the
relief of a poor widow.â€

â€œwhich of these was the good deed, which was the felony?â€ interrupted
the knight.

â€œa good gibe! a good gibe!â€ said wamba; â€œkeeping witty company
sharpeneth the apprehension. you said nothing so well, sir knight, i
will be sworn, when you held drunken vespers with the bluff hermit.--but
to go on. the merry-men of the forest set off the building of a cottage
with the burning of a castle,--the thatching of a choir against the
robbing of a church,--the setting free a poor prisoner against the
murder of a proud sheriff; or, to come nearer to our point, the
deliverance of a saxon franklin against the burning alive of

baron. gentle thieves they are, in short, and courteous robbers; but it
is ever the luckiest to meet with them when they are at the worst.â€

â€œhow so, wamba?â€ said the knight.

â€œwhy, then they have some compunction, and are for making up matters
with heaven. but when they have struck an even balance, heaven help them
with whom they next open the account! the travellers who first met
them after their good service at torquilstone would have a woeful
flaying.--and yet,â€ said wamba, coming close up to the knightâ€™s side,
â€œthere be companions who are far more dangerous for travellers to meet
than yonder outlaws.â€

â€œand who may they be, for you have neither bears nor wolves, i trow?â€
 said the knight.

â€œmarry, sir, but we have malvoisinâ€™s men-at-arms,â€ said wamba; â€œand let
me tell you, that, in time of civil war, a halfscore of these is worth
a band of wolves at any time. they are now expecting their harvest,
and are reinforced with the soldiers that escape

d from torquilstone.
so that, should we meet with a band of them, we are like to pay for our
feats of arms.--now, i pray you, sir knight, what would you do if we met
two of them?â€

â€œpin the villains to the earth with my lance, wamba, if they offered us
any impediment.â€

â€œbut what if there were four of them?â€

â€œthey should drink of the same cup,â€ answered the knight.

â€œwhat if six,â€ continued wamba, â€œand we as we now are, barely two--would
you not remember locksleyâ€™s horn?â€

â€œwhat! sound for aid,â€ exclaimed the knight, â€œagainst a score of such
â€˜rascailleâ€™ as these, whom one good knight could drive before him, as
the wind drives the withered leaves?â€

â€œnay, then,â€ said wamba, â€œi will pray you for a close sight of that same
horn that hath so powerful a breath.â€

the knight undid the clasp of the baldric, and indulged his
fellow-traveller, who immediately hung the b

â€œurge me not with violence, sir knight,â€ said the jester, keeping at a
distance from the impatient champion, â€œor folly will show a clean pair
of heels, and leave valour to find out his way through the wood as best
he may.â€

â€œnay, thou hast hit me there,â€ said the knight; â€œand, sooth to say, i
have little time to jangle with thee. keep the horn an thou wilt, but
let us proceed on our journey.â€

â€œyou will not harm me, then?â€ said wamba.

â€œi tell thee no, thou knave!â€

â€œay, but pledge me your knightly word for it,â€ continued wamba, as he
approached with great caution.

â€œmy knightly word i pledge; only come on with thy foolish self.â€

â€œnay, then, valour and folly are once more boon companions,â€ said the
jester, coming up frankly to the knightâ€™s side; â€œbut, in truth, i love
not such buffets as that you bestowed on the burly friar, when his
holiness rolled on the green like a king of the nine-pins. and now tha

â€œby my faith,â€ said the knight, closing his visor, â€œi think thou beâ€™st
in the right onâ€™t.â€

and in good time did he close it, for three arrows, flew at the same
instant from the suspected spot against his head and breast, one of
which would have penetrated to the brain, had it not been turned aside
by the steel visor. the other two were averted by the gorget, and by the
shield which hung around his neck.

â€œthanks, trusty armourers,â€ said the knight.--â€œwamba, let us close with
them,â€--and he rode straight to the thicket. he was met by six or seven
men-at-arms, who ran against him with their lances at full career. three
of the weapons struck against him, and splintered with as little effect
as if they had been driven against a tower of steel. the black knightâ€™s
eyes seemed to flash fire even through the aperture of his visor. he
raised himself in his stirrups with an air of inexpressible dignity, and
exclaimed, â€œwhat means this, my masters!â€

 an arm which
carried death in every blow, and it seemed as if the terror of his
single strength was about to gain the battle against such odds, when a
knight, in blue armour, who had hitherto kept himself behind the other
assailants, spurred forward with his lance, and taking aim, not at the
rider but at the steed, wounded the noble animal mortally.

â€œthat was a felon stroke!â€ exclaimed the black knight, as the steed fell
to the earth, bearing his rider along with him.

and at this moment, wamba winded the bugle, for the whole had passed so
speedily, that he had not time to do so sooner. the sudden sound made
the murderers bear back once more, and wamba, though so imperfectly
weaponed, did not hesitate to rush in and assist the black knight to
rise.

â€œshame on ye, false cowards!â€ exclaimed he in the blue harness, who
seemed to lead the assailants, â€œdo ye fly from the empty blast of a horn
blown by a jester?â€

animated by his words, they attacked the black knight anew, whose bes

refuge was now to place his back against an oak, and defend himself with
his sword. the felon knight, who had taken another spear, watching the
moment when his formidable antagonist was most closely pressed, galloped
against him in hopes to nail him with his lance against the tree, when
his purpose was again intercepted by wamba. the jester, making up by
agility the want of strength, and little noticed by the men-at-arms, who
were busied in their more important object, hovered on the skirts of the
fight, and effectually checked the fatal career of the blue knight, by
hamstringing his horse with a stroke of his sword. horse and man went to
the ground; yet the situation of the knight of the fetterlock continued
very precarious, as he was pressed close by several men completely
armed, and began to be fatigued by the viole

l part in the fray, soon disposed of the ruffians, all of whom
lay on the spot dead or mortally wounded. the black knight thanked his
deliverers with a dignity they had not observed in his former bearing,
which hitherto had seemed rather that of a blunt bold soldier, than of a
person of exalted rank.

â€œit concerns me much,â€ he said, â€œeven before i express my full gratitude
to my ready friends, to discover, if i may, who have been my unprovoked
enemies.--open the visor of that blue knight, wamba, who seems the chief
of these villains.â€

the jester instantly made up to the leader of the assassins, who,
bruised by his fall, and entangled under the wounded steed, lay
incapable either of flight or resistance.

â€œcome, valiant sir,â€ said wamba, â€œi must be your armourer as well as
your equerry--i have dismounted you, and now i will unhelm you.â€

so saying, with no very gentle hand he undid the helmet of the blue
knight, which, rolling to a distance on the grass, displayed to the

hath not heard a name that has been borne as far as palestine? but be
assured, brave outlaw, that no deed done in our absence, and in the
turbulent times to which it hath given rise, shall be remembered to thy
disadvantage.â€

â€œtrue says the proverb,â€ said wamba, interposing his word, but with some
abatement of his usual petulance,--

â€œâ€˜when the cat is away, the mice will play.â€™â€

â€œwhat, wamba, art thou there?â€ said richard; â€œi have been so long of
hearing thy voice, i thought thou hadst taken flight.â€

â€œi take flight!â€ said wamba; â€œwhen do you ever find folly separated from
valour? there lies the trophy of my sword, that good grey gelding, whom
i heartily wish upon his legs again, conditioning his master lay there

â€œand to good purpose, honest wamba,â€ replied the king. â€œthy good service
shall not be forgotten.â€

â€œâ€˜confiteor! confiteor!â€™â€--exclaimed, in a submissive tone, a voice near
the kingâ€™s side--â€œmy latin will carry me no farther--but i confess my
deadly treason, and pray leave to have absolution before i am led to
execution!â€

richard looked around, and beheld the jovial friar on his knees, telling
his rosary, while his quarter-staff, which had not been idle during the
skirmish, lay on the grass beside him. his co

untenance was gathered so
as he thought might best express the most profound contrition, his
eyes being turned up, and the corners of his mouth drawn down, as wamba
expressed it, like the tassels at the mouth of a purse. yet this demure
affectation of extreme penitence was whimsically belied by a ludicrous
meaning which lurked in his huge features, and seemed to pronounce his
fear and repentance alike hypocritical.

â€œfor what art thou cast down, mad priest?â€ said richard; â€œart thou
afraid thy diocesan should learn how truly thou dost serve our lady and

wilfred bowed in submission, well knowing how vain it was to contend
with the wild spirit of chivalry which so often impelled his master
upon dangers which he might easily have avoided, or rather, which it
was unpardonable in him to have sought out. the young knight sighed,
therefore, and held his peace; while richard, rejoiced at having

the charge he had brought against him, went on in con

scathlock obeyed his captain, and in less than five minutes the
revellers were startled by the sound of his horn.

â€œit is the bugle of malvoisin,â€ said the miller, starting to his feet,
and seizing his bow. the friar dropped the flagon, and grasped his
quarter-staff. wamba stopt short in the midst of a jest, and betook
himself to sword and target. all the others stood to their weapons.

men of their precarious course of life change readily from the banquet
to the battle; and, to richard, the exchange seemed but a succession of
pleasure. he called for his helmet and the most cumbrous parts of his
armour, which he had laid aside; and while gurth was putting them on,
he laid his strict injunctions on wilfred, under pain of his highest
displeasure, not to engage in t

from the unwilling hands of king john when he succeeded to his heroic
brother. as for the rest of robin hoodâ€™s career, as well as the tale
of his treacherous death, they are to be found in those black-letter
garlands, once sold at the low and easy rate of one halfpenny.

the outlawâ€™s opinion proved true; and the king, attended by ivanhoe,
gurth, and wamba, arrived, without any interruption, within view of the
castle of coningsburgh, while the sun was yet in the horizon.

there are few more beautiful or striking scenes in england, than are
presented by the vicinity of this ancient saxon fortress. the soft and
gentle river don sweeps through an amphitheatre, in which cultivation is
richly blended with woodland, and on a mount, ascending from the river,
well defended by walls and ditches, rises this ancient edifice, which,

specially as he imagined the features of the latter were
familiar to him. besides, the approach of two knights, for such their
dress bespoke them, was a rare event at a saxon solemnity, and could not
but be regarded as a sort of honour to the deceased and his family. and
in his sable dress, and holding in his hand his white wand of office,
this important personage made way through the miscellaneous assemblage
of guests, thus conducting richard and ivanhoe to the entrance of the
tower. gurth and wamba speedily found acquaintances in the court-yard,
nor presumed to intrude themselves any farther until their presence
should be required.

was learned that he had hastened to the court-yard, summoned to his

steed, compelled the jew to mount another, and set off at a rate, which,
